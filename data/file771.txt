7710005 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the senate
7710006 i am here tonight to pay tribute to two men who have changed my life and the life of this country barack obama and edward m kennedy
7710007 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7710008 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most

7710014 celebrate saratoga wasnt really serving the purpose that a chamber is supposed to serve which is to support and help the businesses grow and prosper
7710015 in years previous celebrate saratoga was the marquee event for saratoga residents had always given us great support for it
7710016 however it has to change it has to be a better event not just for residents but for the greater community
7710017 the youth of this city even my children are night crawlers they only come out after dark
7710018 one of the biggest reasons for the changes was to change the energy of the event and make it more of a pleasant event that appeals more toward the generation with more disposable income
7710019 what were trying to accomplish is to create a better business environment for our members and businesses of saratoga
7710020 so if thats what youre trying to accomplish then having a street dance in the middle of the night is not bringing that client to the city its bringing something else
7710021 the street dance has been a real fundraiser for the chamber because the chamber would not be able to exist without it were taking a big chance here
7710022 weve never closed for hot weather were just opening how can we close
7710023 i cant remember a time weve closed because of hot weather and thats even before we had air conditioning

7710032 the ones you pass are different than the others the ones that set will make me draw double like a guy having a heart attack
7710033 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
7710034 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7710035 here is what the catechism of the catholic church says
7710036 whether joe biden is as ignorant of what his religion teaches remains to be seen
7710037 the single greatest strength america has in the middle east
7710038 probably my most poignant seder memory is not with the bergers but what happened right after i came back from meeting golda meir in 1973 i had predicted that something was going on in egypt and i remember people talking about what it meant to them if israel were actually defeated
7710039 in my line of work you gotta keep repeating things over and over and over
7710040 we just think it is a recipe for some type of disaster to occur dequine said

7710066 if we need to add positions then well put positions there we just dont know whats a good amount
7710067 we know theres no money in the system but you cant say this is a good budget

7710076 he said get back in the car and go to the hospital
7710077 it was good for measuring blood glucose levels but it didnt perform as well when measuring blood pressure
7710078 i will never forget that it saved my fathers life to have that in the house
7710079 i think if no one is watching you know anythings possible
7710080 immediately upon going down the slide he started screaming his hands were extremely red and he was rubbing them together within a few minutes he started blistering
7710081 he was screaming in a lot of pain eventually they had to give him morphine then they had to knock him out to perform a procedure to actually scrap the blisters off his hands so they could heal properly
7710082 children are like the elderly their skin is very thin they can sustain very severe burn injuries even at a very short amount of time at higher degrees
7710083 any kind of metal or plastic playground equipment any kind of toy objects those are all big safety concerns when dealing with children and different kinds of burn injuries
7710084 we wanted to get the word out to everybody so it doesnt happen to anybody else
7710085 well i think you can just do the hand test just feel things ahead of time and then if its okay let them run wide if not bring them to another park
7710086 children are like the elderly their skin is very thin they can sustain very severe burn injuries even at a very short amount of time at higher degrees
7710087 at united we are proud to fly americas olympic and paralympic teams and the many athletes who are pursuing their lifelong dreams
7710088 our sponsorship of the u s olympic committee gives us an association with a partner that embodies many of the same qualities to which we aspire all on a global stage
7710089 i was on the bus today and there was a lady seated in front of me and she was digging her nose like there was no tomorrow seriously she was digging it like it was an olympic sport like there was a pot of gold at the end of the dirty rainbow we went past two bus stops and she was still going at it i didnt know whether to applaud her or to smash her nose
7710090 she did the promo for them but there never were any plans for her to appear on the show
7710091 a place in time is no place for me but a place without time i could only wish to hold my breath
7710092 language was simply and crystal clear purposely designed by us to frame the vote as being for or against aggression
7710093 hmmm what is that i must move closer and see if it is a toad it sure is moving funny across the landscaping
7710094 mama i just cant wear my pajamas all day i need to get dressed
7710095 boo bear wants to get dressed too you know i put out some clothes for her
7710096 attention is an act of connection we look from where we are to what is all around us in doing so we discover where we are at the act of paying attention is what brings us peace
7710097 sometimes life is merely a matter of coffee and whatever intimacy a cup of coffee affords
7710098 if we think we have no stories it is because we have not paid enough attention to our lives most of us live lives that are far richer and more meaningful than we appreciate
7710099 i might have to transfer somewhere else to another program which means we might have to move
7710100 whatever we need to do well do moving isnt my ideal because we came here for a reason to be near family in the mountains
7710101 but daddy we cant move away if we move away i wont get to look at owens mountain anymore
7710102 attention is an act of connection we look from where we are to what is all around us in doing so we discover where we are at the act of paying attention is what brings us peace
7710103 sometimes life is merely a matter of coffee and whatever intimacy a cup of coffee affords
7710104 if we think we have no stories it is because we have not paid enough attention to our lives most of us live lives that are far richer and more meaningful than we appreciate
7710105 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we are all meant to shine as children do we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us its not just in some of us its in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others
7710106 we hear that some among you are idle they are not busy they are busybodies such people we command and urge in the lord jesus christ to settle down and earn the bread they eat
7710107 wait there is no hurry i have lingered on this shore long enough in misery in suffering in anguish in agony now all that has disappeared i am in absolute bliss silence and peace and i dont see that there is anything more on the other shore so as long as i can manage i will be here to help people
7710108 you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind 38 this is the first and great commandment 39 a second likewise is this you shall love your neighbor as yourself 40 the whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments
7710109 the themes from the dead matter movie were a perfect match
7710110 they allowed us to expand on familiar territory as well as explore new musical ground and add to our instrumental palette
7710111 several tracks from this disc will be appearing in the dead matter movie
7710112 the disc also features bonus material that gavin wrote specifically for the film those tracks mark the first inclusion of gothic rock songs since the self titled debut in 97 and are a fitting complement to the rest of the disc and the movie
7710113 time stands still best in moments that look suspiciously like ordinary life
7710114 and all the loveliest things there be come simply so it seems to me
7710115 anyone can become angry that is easy but to be angry with the right person at the right time and for the right purpose and in the right way that is not within everyones power and that is not easy
7710116 ah so youre awake i would take it easy right now if i were you quite the slash you had on your back there its healing up nicely considering im quite new to this
7710117 once my strength returns ill probably be able to mend it up the rest of the way however i believe i owe you my gratitude
7710118 it is part of my duty besides we could not just leave you there to die there arent enough mages like you in this world
7710119 i cant agree with you more however i should direct a related question to you there were two of you dressed alike were there not who are you
7710120 well me personally my name is feil litiere im an acolyte here at the carbuncle basilica we are nothing more than humble white mages living lives of servitude and humility to those in need you were carried here by my comrade markus he would be here if it were not for other duties as it were
7710121 i see my name is sylph stridemoon of what was once glenprice a village that is now reduced to ash if that
7710122 yes most unfortunate our elders went to investigate but even with their healing powers there was nothing they could do what happened there
7710123 i only wish i could have done something about those fiends but yet i wonder both why they never came into our territory and why they left you alive
7710124 it is something i wonder myself and im determined to find the answers i seek
7710125 then allow me to assist you my friend im a mere acolyte but i learn quickly please place your trust in me i am sure that i share your pain at the thought of the suffering those people went through i do not want to see it happen again
7710126 first you should get some rest eat when you like i shall return later after i have conferred with the elders about your tale
7710127 come quickly with me to the audience chamber the elders have something to tell you
7710128 my quality is good and i wont get fired unless its for sexual harassment
7710129 as we got to allentown pennsylvania people lined up and cheered
7710130 there is actually an agreement concluded between the two parties over the definite date which is 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7710131 there is an agreement between the two sides that there will be no foreign soldiers in iraq after 2011
7710132 were optimistic that iraq and the us can reach a mutual agreement on flexible goals for us troops to continue to return on success based on conditions on the ground and allow iraqi forces to provide security for a sovereign iraq
7710133 neither our ceo jim mulva nor any of the executive vps are planning to attend the conventions were not hosting events at the convention
7710134 sap requires a real skill set and even though infosys already operates in the sector for a first piece of larger m amp a axon gives them a great leg up
7710135 crews immediately started treating the child and very quickly took him to birmingham childrens hospital two additional paramedics travelled with the ambulance crew to provide additional assistance
7710136 everybodys in shock there are no words to describe it really the whole road loves them
7710137 the children usually come down here and spend all day with us at 4pm they go home when they went home yesterday they were playing with their dad in the garden
7710138 he was target practising with the gun and then somebody rang his mobile the gun was ready to fire and he answered the phone
7710139 rashids sister is really active and she got hold of the gun and pointed it at her brother he was on the high ground and she was on the low ground it hit him right in the middle of the back of his head
7710140 an 18 month old boy is in a critical condition in hospital with a serious head injury after what appears to be a tragic accident the toddler was playing with other young children in the garden of his home in the washwood heath area when he sustained a pellet wound to the back of the head from an air weapon
7710141 as a parent of three youngsters i know that beyond doubt this is every parents worst nightmare everyones prayers and thoughts should be with little rashid and his family they will be going through absolute hell
7710142 thankfully birmingham childrens hospital is among the best of its kind in the world ive had leaders at the very top of the nhs tell me that if their child fell ill there is nowhere they would rather have them looked after than birmingham childrens
7710143 during the last downturn we had reports of rates for contractors being slashed by major banks but more than four times as many it directors think rates will rise than fall which shows that skills shortages are still very much an issue
7710144 votorantims aim is to reorganise vcp and aracruz to capture synergies forming a world leader in the pulp industry
7710145 allows vcp to act both as an acquirer and a controlling shareholder exerting inappropriate influence over the transaction
7710146 as significant investors in the broader brazilian market they have raised their concerns because of the damaging effect they anticipate this action could have on both the value of their other brazilian holdings and on confidence in the brazilian market as a whole
7710147 the recent progress of many brazilian companies to protect the rights of shareholders as this has contributed to the countrys rising reputation in the global capital markets therefore we regard this most recent development with particular disappointment indeed alarm and we urge your intervention
7710148 we are asking the cvm to encourage the two parties in this specific case to act voluntarily to protect minorities but ultimately what is most important is that the cvm re evaluate the existing regulatory framework so as to restore global investor confidence in the brazilian capital markets
7710149 this is yet another example of a seemingly trusted organisation appearing to be sloppy with peoples personal information people are entitled to wonder why they are constantly being told about the importance of protecting personal information when large organisations dont seem to follow the same rules themselves
7710150 profitability in the service sector is clearly under pressure this pressure initially confined mainly to consumer services such as hospitality and travel has spread to the professional and business services sector this reflects much tougher trading conditions for business and professional firms after a period when business trends had been holding up in the face of the slowing economy
7710151 it was my first win in a grand slam tournament outside wimbledon so it was obviously very special
7710152 it was a solid performance shes a bit of an awkward player and had three matches under her belt here so she wasnt to be underestimated i think i handled the situation pretty well it wasnt nerves on the first match point i just went for it a bit on the second serve the ace on the second match point made up for it
7710153 ive only ever played in qualifying rounds here in previous years
7710154 today there was a lot more noise a lot more going on you could hear the announcements from arthur ashe court and you could smell the burgers it was very different to wimbledon
7710155 this is yet another crushing blow against tyranny and dictatorship in this country
7710156 with the economic situation worsening and the property market still suffering we are calling on the government to take urgent action on hips
7710157 we have long seen hips as not fit for purpose and as the wrong answer to simplifying the house buying process quite simply the government tried to force square pegs into round holes and the slower property market is making this situation worse for instance the current call for local searches to be conducted as part of a hip is madness due to the length of time properties are on the market in the current climate a majority of searches are out of date by the time the property is sold which means they have to be repeated at extra cost to the consumer
7710158 these legal documents must be taken out of the packs and left to buyers and their advisers to obtain at the appropriate time during the transaction
7710159 i didnt lose my serve the whole match i thought he played pretty well for about a set and a half he was hitting his forehand really hard and making me do a bit of running it was a decent test and i came through it pretty well
7710160 it was quite tight until the end of the second set but once id won that it was always going to be a long way back for him i felt much more relaxed after that and started to come forward a little bit and play a bit more aggressively
7710161 you had so many great athletes around you i didnt leave the olympic village at all from when i arrived it was a bit strange there are no cars there and you dont hear any planes there was just no noise in the village
7710162 i really enjoyed meeting all the other athletes and started collecting pins from other countries going to speak to the other athletes and swapping pins was one of the highlights for me i got to speak to people from places like the cook islands and british virgin islands and i collected 120 pins
7710163 im feeling really confident just now regardless of what happened in beijing
7710164 i feel im hitting the ball well i feel mentally strong and physically im not tired i want to do well here and today was a good start
7710165 by the time i get here ive been playing a lot after the us open you normally have a few weeks off to prepare for the last part of the season but when you arrive here or at wimbledon you havent had much time to prepare
7710166 i havent played very well here in the last few years though i thought i was playing well in 2006 then i had a tough match against mikhail youzhny he played very well but i still had a big chance to beat him and reach the semi finals hopefully ill play better this time
7710167 still softening is clearly the goal here as is evidenced by michelles cuddling with her children
7710168 the coal group positioned to help ease south africas long term energy crisis
7710169 has taken a major step towards full scale coal production at its elitheni deposit near indwe in the eastern cape
7710170 there is only a week to go in the transfer window so you start to concern yourself a bit
7710171 we have shown we have a good quality of player here and we would like to add to it obviously
7710172 we played one up last season and it suited us because we were hard to beat
7710173 everyone else plays one up united do chelsea play that way as well i bought two strikers to play them together like everybody else in football i think that defoe and crouch are a good combination but only time will tell
7710174 they are still perfectly capable of winning the league without berbatov
7710175 im sure they will end up with berbatov and be even stronger there are two teams who will probably slug it out for the league title and we have played them both already these two will be the teams to beat
7710176 the interims will show solid double digit growth and demonstrate the strengths of the business model in difficult economic backgrounds
7710177 we expect european profits to be around 70 per cent higher in what is a seasonally weak trading period whilst north american profits are expected to be flat at best as the slowing construction activity starts to affect parts of the business
7710178 we believe investor focus will be around the companys contract pipeline outlook and its ability to maintain high utilization rates in the face of delayed project sanctioning backlog has remained broadly flat since end of 2007
7710179 there are headwinds building from rising us unemployment data and we believe the weakening macro conditions in the uk spain and ireland could have an impact on premium spirits consumption
7710180 we have pencilled in pendragon producing an adjusted pre tax profit of 19m which compares to 32 7m generated last year
7710181 the key things we will be looking for are the state of its balance sheet and whether it is in a position to survive during the next 12 months or so
7710182 this website will be subscription free clearly if successful along with globrix a news corp funded ad based model it could pose a significant threat to the underlying subscription nature and pricing power of the rightmove offering
7710183 there is only a week to go in the transfer window so you start to concern yourself a bit
7710184 we have shown we have a good quality of player here and we would like to add to it obviously
7710185 we played one up last season and it suited us because we were hard to beat
7710186 everyone else plays one up united do chelsea play that way as well i bought two strikers to play them together like everybody else in football i think that defoe and crouch are a good combination but only time will tell
7710187 they are still perfectly capable of winning the league without berbatov
7710188 im sure they will end up with berbatov and be even stronger there are two teams who will probably slug it out for the league title and we have played them both already these two will be the teams to beat
7710189 this budget is built on the foundation of the longest period of economic stability and sustained growth in our countrys history after 10 years of sustained growth britains growth will continue into its 59th quarter the forecast end of the cycle and then into its 60th and 61st quarter and beyond
7710190 when these things get thrown at you you actually try that much harder
7710191 he thaksin is even more adamant now because this is his love and he wants to show people he is really committed i asked the question as well as everyone else is the club for sale and he is quite adamant this club is not for sale and he is here for the long haul
7710192 i asked why did you buy it he said he bought it because there is a 10 year plan
7710193 this was a big win for us irrespective of the fact west ham went down to 10 men mark noble was sent off so early i felt we were in control
7710194 there was a real determination in our play and a willingness to ask questions of the opposition it was a good all round performance and once we got our noses in front there was only going to be one winner
7710195 sales have picked up significantly in several florida and california markets home prices generally follow sales trends after a few months of lag time
7710196 still inventory remains high in many parts of the country and will require time to fully absorb
7710197 the work goes on the cause endures the hope still lives and the dream shall never die
7710198 im voting for hillary on wednesday christopher nichols a clinton delegate from menlo park calif
7710199 what i do in november remains to be seen i have a lot of questions about obamas past associations i dont feel like i know who
7710200 she was really treated unfairly she should have at least been vetted for the vice presidency that really frustrates me he said
7710201 regardless of what senator clinton says on wednesday i am bound by statute to vote for the person im pledged for and i decided to vote for hillary on wednesday and on thursday will join with the obama campaign
7710202 more for the city and the state than for me or the firm
7710203 we are decidedly not interested in just thinking smart thoughts and hoping someone cares
7710204 the specific goal of the organization was to be bipartisan to not be post partisan nonpartisan or transpartisan
7710205 but to actually have republicans and democrats who believe in the core issues of their party but also believe that washington can function better when it comes to legislating
7710206 its really more about being able to show a huge unique and influential group of people who we are
7710207 will be invited to exclusive forums and special events where you will interact with our local and national government as well as business leaders from around the country
7710208 we do a lot of business in denver we looked at these as opportunities to help these three cities pull off these events
7710209 the sheer magnitude of the dollars needed to support something like this you need to have corporate sponsors
7710210 in fact you go to a small percentage of the events you are invited to because you have your duties to preside
7710211 a few hours after delivering her 10 minute prime time speech to the convention scheduled headliners were tony bennett john legend and james taylor tickets were distributed for free by the democratic congressional campaign committee dccc the house campaign arm
7710212 its disappointing when your candidate does not win pelosi who stayed neutral through the primaries told the clinton supporters in the room
7710213 its just not about us and our feelings or about the campaign its about the hopes and aspirations of the american people and they are focusing on us
7710214 were expecting these lobbying organizations to try to evade the rules
7710215 if house members try to use that guidance to justify parties were just going to go to the public and explain what the actual rules are and make the case thats a violation

7710224 che vi sia ciascun lo dice dove sia nessun lo sa
7710225 that there is one they all say where it may be no one knows
7710226 providing passengers with safe high speed rail will have significant environmental and metropolitan planning advantages and help diversify our nations transportation infrastructure
7710227 our domestic rail freight capacity must also be strengthened because our demand for rail transportation has never been greater leaving many key transportation hubs stretched to capacity obama is committed to renewing the federal governments commitment to high speed rail so that our nations transportation infrastructure continues to support and not hinder our nations long term economic growth
7710228 in 2000 when he was chairman of the senate science commerce and transportation committee mccain killed 10 billion in capital funding for amtrak
7710229 particularly among rail advocates mccain is well known as a consistent critic of amtrak who has repeatedly tried to eliminate national passenger train service by slashing funding and proposing to dismember the national system into disparate regional entities
7710230 verily the pious and righteous will be in delight paradise
7710231 whoever establishes the prayers on the night of qadr with sincere faith and anticipation for allahs rewards then all his past sins shall be forgiven
7710232 and whoever establishes the prayer on the night of qadr with sincere faith and anticipation then all his past sins shall be forgiven
7710233 messenger of allah do you think that if i am killed in the cause of allah my sins will be blotted out from me
7710234 yes in case you are killed in the cause of allah and you were patient and anticipating for allahs reward and you always fought facing the enemy never turning your back upon them
7710235 do you think if i am killed in the cause of allah all my sins will be obliterated from me
7710236 yes if you were patient and anticipating and always fought facing the enemy and never turning your back upon him then all your sins would be forgiven except debt angel gabriel has just told me this
7710237 i asked the messenger of allah about the plague he told me that it was a punishment sent by allah on whom he wished and allah made it a source of mercy for the believers for if one in the time of an epidemic plague stays in his town with patience anticipation for allahs reward and believing that nothing will befall him except what allah has written for him he will get the reward of a martyr
7710238 whoever accompanies the funeral procession of a muslim out of sincere faith and anticipation for allahs reward and remains with it till the funeral prayer is offered and the burial ceremonies are over will return with a reward of two carats each carat is like the size of mount uhud he who offers the funeral prayer only and returns before the burial will return with the reward of one carat only
7710239 verily any deed you do in which you sincerely seek allahs pleasure will raise you in ranks and honor
7710240 learn your intentions for they are more important than the deeds themselves
7710241 i would not be pleased if my house was next to mosque i want my footpath to the mosque and my return to be written in my records
7710242 and i went to him and said why dont you buy a donkey to avoid the heat and the insects of earth he said by allah i would not even wish to have my house next door of the muhammads house so i actually dragged him all the way until we reached the prophet may peace and blessings be upon him and i told him what the man said and the prophet called the man and told him that he will get what he hoped for you shall be given what you have anticipated said the prophet may peace and blessings be upon him
7710243 say as they say means the muazeneen if you finish then supplicate and allah will answer you
7710244 if you hear the athan reply the call of allah
7710245 if the muslim performs the ablution his sins will get out from his ears his eyes his hands and his feet so if he finishes he will be forgiven
7710246 the ablution is half of the faith of a believer narrated by muslim
7710247 three things performing a perfect ablution during the hard times like cold walking to the mosques and waiting for the prayer after the prayer all those three expiate you from sins completely narrated by abu yaala and al hakim al baihaqi and corrected by al albani 926 in sahih al jamei
7710248 only the believer will remain with his ablution sustaining it at all times narrated by ibn majah at tabarani and corrected by al albani 953 in sahih al jamei
7710249 my people will be called on the day of resurrection and they will be ghuraran muhajaleen with a special mark as a result of their ablution
7710250 siwak is a purification for the mouth and satisfaction for the lord
7710251 if i had not found it hard for my followers or the people i would have ordered them to clean their teeth with siwak for every prayer and to make ablution before each prayer
7710252 if anyone amongst you performs the ablution and then completes the ablution well and then says i testify that there is no god but allah and that muhammad is the servant of allah and his messenger the eight gates of paradise would be opened for him and he may enter by whichever of them he wishes
7710253 whoever performs the ablution and said how perfect is allah and i praise you i bear witness that there is no god but you ask your forgiveness and turn to you in repentance this will be written and then will be kept in a container which will never be broken until the day of judgment

7710258 now our thoughts are on the slavia game and finding continuity
7710259 the results keep demonstrating that changing to circular hooks is the right choice since it favours turtle conservation without having an impact on the economy of artisanal fisheries
7710260 together with fishermen we are building a culture for sustainable fishing practices that will guarantee fish stocks in the long term
7710261 our goal is to reduce the incidental catch of marine turtles from the long line fishing operations without affecting the fisheries activity which is a main source of food and income for local communities
7710262 this programme is going beyond an initial focus of saving sea turtles from bycatch and is creating the groundwork toward sustainable artisanal long line fishing in the eastern pacific
7710263 by working co operatively collecting data and learning how to improve practices this programme is living proof that conservation and industry can work together for sustainability

7710269 if they release the playstation 4 and have an even more expensive console and raise the cost of games by ten dollars that would not be good

7710300 migrant workers can bring enormous benefits to local businesses and areas however many of these contributions such as new ideas and ways of working and an entrepreneurial spirit may have been neglected in the past
7710301 to get the most out of migration local communities alongside local leaders businesses universities and central government need to recognise the variety of benefits that migrants can bring and plan accordingly
7710302 with the economic situation worsening and the property market still suffering we are calling on the government to take urgent action on hips we have long seen hips as not fit for purpose and as the wrong answer to simplifying the house buying process quite simply the government tried to force square pegs into round holes and the slower property market is making this situation worse
7710303 hips are already bringing benefits to consumers by providing important information to help families cut their fuel bills and carbon emissions and have reduced the price of property searches by increasing transparency in the home buying and selling process

7710419 i am ready to step in there and hopefully there wont be a letdown at all
7710420 we are going to go forward with the players that we have
7710421 and we are always looking for and searching for people who can help our team and nothing is going to change with regard to that
7710422 i would have done whatever to try to get him back initially but now how could you not want him back
7710423 wouldnt that be something he comes back and we start a trend
7710424 as i know it he is probably on a beach somewhere sipping on some pina coladas so i doubt football is the first thing on his mind today
7710425 he has not been bouncing back and forth like favre
7710426 he has been pretty happy we saw him up here and he said he missed it but he was content he has decided to go on to the next phase of his life so i dont look too strongly into that him playing again
7710427 it is something that he all of us really wanted but obviously we didnt want these circumstances for him to get back
7710428 it is a good thing for him it is a good thing for this team he is definitely a d lineman at heart and hopefully he can just come back in and not miss a beat
7710429 the questions posed to mr bonds by two different prosecutors at his grand jury appearance were imprecise redundant overlapping and frequently compound

7710431 the council has said they didnt want to have layoffs but personnel is 83 percent of the police departments budget
7710432 if the departments can cut their budgets a minimum of 5 percent maybe we can use reserves to stem the tide a while until we get a handle of whats going on
7710433 the council has eliminated some items and added others that werent included in the budget
7710434 were also looking at water and garbage rates park rentals and other fees

7710444 the ability to slice and dice information in various ways comment on it tag it and build collaborative knowledgebases is very powerful but this very feature richness also makes the platform a bit daunting especially because its somewhat dated interface doesnt always work as effectively as most competitors to simplify your options

7710451 neighbor joe deloach lives one door down from brown and he too has rising waters flooding the foundation of his home he said when he saw the city with prisoners sandbagging the congresswomans home he naturally asked for the same help but didnt get the same response

7710457 spouses and children of and or people who have intimate relations with corrupt officials could be jailed for more than seven years if they are found guilty of taking advantage of such officials positions to get bribes or make money illegally
7710458 taking bribes has become a practice among some relatives and or lovers of corrupt officials

7710463 there are no existing charges against me hence its premature to make a decision on my candidacy for the november elections they will find nothing in my work as a senator that is illegal irregular or ill disposed
7710464 i am recommending for the speculations to be set aside until the panorama is cleared up
7710465 i respect our party presidents decisions although i dont feel the same way
7710466 this was just a mild thing what if we get a hurricane we have to be prepared and i dont think we are ready for a disaster in the country
7710467 because all rivers in the eastern corridor broke their banks breaking bridges and causing areas that were never flooded before to come under water
7710468 i agree that where we have corruption people should face the full brunt of the law they should be charged taken to court all of that stuff but a lot of the other part where people ascribe corrupt motives there may be a time difference a lag in financial transactions
7710469 it is not money that you can transfer to the government and then the government spends it in that fiscal year to bring them into the books is not paying over cash to the government it is just a book entry so again to say that there are billions lying in dormant accounts creates the impression that there is money to be spent and the government is not transferring it from one dormant account into the consolidated fund because of some corrupt motive
7710470 a key provision was inserted into the law that the auditor general when he completes his audit must send that to the accounting officer of each ministry and they have up to one month to respond and he has to include their response as part of his report not to pick and choose elements of their response and incorporated into his report

7710487 you should be mother dear because when i smoke this much weed and it is called weed weed smoke pot herb ganja grass not dope dope is heroin kthxbai its because there are nasty things lurking beneath my smooth stoner facade and once i sober up i will once again want to maul the face of every other human being i see without weed my every other circular thought is about suicide why why not to whom it may concern weed brings me bouncing back from the brink of suicidal insanity to happily be distracted by flash cartoons and sketchbooks and willy wonka weed does for me what nothing else can weed contents me with the way things are without it i am miserable because i have no refuge from my own mind in anything but weed
7710488 have you seen this if you dont have anything to say dont say anything
7710489 what is up with that and whats with all the being crabby and pointing out the obvious its like reading a family guy script and even more pathetically on a computer monitor
7710490 why isnt anyone writing things that make you want to i dunno read a comic book
7710491 all of this leads us to predict that within the diverse ensemble of planetary systems ones resembling our own are the exception rather than the rule

7710509 accelerating pace at which the region was being exploited under the guise of development
7710510 although it might be legal it would leave a huge scar on the pitons the islands twin volcanic peaks

7710513 motivating an instrument of sharing beliefs and values from diverse art forms a memorable event with lasting impact on a whole generation of caribbean people and their caribbean culture
7710514 what gives me a greater sense of fulfillment is the fact that carifesta x has adopted a popular policy it will appeal to the imagination of people at all levels of society and it would leave lasting monuments in their memories
7710515 in returning home carifesta has moved from being a caribbean renaissance from the 1970s to a source of empowerment pride and a more confident establishment of identity
7710516 carifesta and our culture is an important part of the foundation of our regional movement where our artistes have led the way in giving expression to our richest cultural expression and traditions the region needs to recognize the important role of culture in strengthening the caricom family

7710520 the origins of the christian mystical tradition from plato to denys
7710521 partakers of the divine nature the history and development of deification in the christian traditions
7710522 for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that each one may receive what is due him for the things done while in the body whether good or bad since then we know what it is to fear the lord we try to persuade men
7710523 for christs love compels us because we are convinced that one died for all and therefore all died and he died for all that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again so from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view though we once regarded christ in this way we do so no longer therefore if anyone is in christ jesus he is a new creation the old has gone the new has come all this is from god who reconciled us to himself through christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation that god was reconciling the world to himself in christ not counting mens sins against them and he has committed to us the message of reconciliation we are therefore christs ambassadors as through us we implore you on christs behalf be reconciled to god god made him who had no sin to be sin for us so that in him we might become the righteousness of god
7710524 since we have these promises dear friends let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit perfecting holiness out of reverence for god

7710563 not always and not always soon but it comes back to you
7710564 its so important to bring people together at the grassroots level instead of from the top so its about inviting them in and making them part of something because we all long to belong

7710638 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table
7710639 with kara by her side paula finally has some back up and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7710640 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7710641 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here and nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight

7710644 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
7710645 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
7710646 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
7710647 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
7710648 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
7710649 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
7710650 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
7710651 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
7710652 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
7710653 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
7710654 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
7710655 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
7710656 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
7710657 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
7710658 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
7710659 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
7710660 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
7710661 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
7710662 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
7710663 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
7710664 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
7710665 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
7710666 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
7710667 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
7710668 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
7710669 this is new york we can throw our trash wherever we wanna
7710670 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7710671 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7710672 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7710673 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7710674 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7710675 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
7710676 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7710677 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7710678 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
7710679 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7710680 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7710681 there used to be an organization for people who believed in a truly limited government limited taxes limited spending limited interference in individual lives and limited intervention in foreign affairs that organization was known as the republican party but the only one of those beliefs that still motivates the g o p establishment is limited taxes
7710682 the stakes of this election will be made very clear
7710683 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
7710684 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
7710685 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
7710686 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7710687 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7710688 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7710689 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7710690 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7710691 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7710692 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7710693 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
7710694 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
7710695 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
7710696 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
7710697 moreover since bill is not and has not been for years gainfully employed he will be scrounging around for cash everywhere but that wouldnt be exactly new would it
7710698 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
7710699 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
7710700 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
7710701 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
7710702 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
7710703 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance
7710704 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
7710705 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
7710706 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
7710707 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
7710708 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
7710709 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7710710 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
7710711 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
7710712 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
7710713 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
7710714 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7710715 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7710716 i like what he says and theres something about him i trust im going to take a chance on him
7710717 the survey suggests that this the economy is an umbrella issue covering many other concerns including those relative to health care
7710718 if i were designing a system from scratch i would probably go ahead with a single payer system
7710719 given that a lot of people work for insurance companies a lot of people work for hmos youve got a whole system of institutions that have been set up
7710720 we wish george bush could serve us another 8 years in the same stellar manner he served us the last but alas our great constitution which he has worked so hard to uphold will not allow that we realize now that he has the rest of the world pretty much straightened out that he could complete his domestic agenda if he had the time
7710721 i believe that every american has the right to affordable health care i believe that the millions of americans who cant take their children to a doctor when they get sick have that right we now face an opportunity and an obligation to turn the page on the failed politics of yesterdays health care debates its time to bring together businesses the medical community and members of both parties around a comprehensive solution to this crisis and its time to let the drug and insurance industries know that while theyll get a seat at the table they dont get to buy every chair
7710722 and nothing illustrates obamas failure so far to put some meat on his campaign than his inability to nail mccain on this issue and to speak specifically and powerfully about his own excellent plan which he announced early in the campaign
7710723 family is shaping the content of the entire day and thats not been done before
7710724 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
7710725 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7710726 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7710727 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7710728 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to
7710729 make people aware of the kind of sacrifice barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope
7710730 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7710731 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7710732 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7710733 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7710734 except in three cases that of their wives their daughters and their girlfriends
7710735 nancy unwilling to stand up for womens pro choice beliefs
7710736 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
7710737 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
7710738 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off
7710739 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7710740 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7710741 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7710742 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7710743 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7710744 we believe that coal use will increase under any foreseeable scenario because it is cheap and abundant
7710745 should and will take actions to reduce the emissions of co2 and other greenhouse gas emissions
7710746 coal will continue to play a large and indispensable role in a greenhouse gas constrained world
7710747 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7710748 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7710749 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7710750 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7710751 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7710752 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
7710753 if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us
7710754 stands alone right now in the world in terms of power
7710755 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
7710756 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
7710757 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7710758 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7710759 it could be good for the nation if other corporate companies could emulate what standard bank has done to work with undp on an issue that is of national and global concern
7710760 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7710761 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7710762 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7710763 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7710764 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7710765 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7710766 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7710767 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7710768 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7710769 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7710770 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7710771 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7710772 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7710773 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7710774 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7710775 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7710776 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7710777 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7710778 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7710779 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7710780 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7710781 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7710782 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7710783 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7710784 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7710785 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7710786 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7710787 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7710788 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7710789 hi there are you ok because its a long fall from heaven
7710790 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7710791 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7710792 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7710793 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7710794 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7710795 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7710796 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7710797 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7710798 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7710799 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7710800 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7710801 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7710802 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7710803 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7710804 the systems that generate elections and earthquakes are complex systems
7710805 they are not predictable by simple equations but after coarse graining averaging they become predictable
7710806 we didnt look at it as reagan versus carter or republicans versus democrats or liberals versus conservatives rather we looked at elections as stability versus upheavals
7710807 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7710808 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7710809 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7710810 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7710811 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7710812 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7710813 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7710814 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7710815 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7710816 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7710817 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7710818 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7710819 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7710820 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7710821 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7710822 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7710823 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7710824 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7710825 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7710826 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7710827 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7710828 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7710829 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7710830 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7710831 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7710832 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7710833 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7710834 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7710835 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7710836 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
7710837 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
7710838 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
7710839 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
7710840 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7710841 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7710842 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7710843 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7710844 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7710845 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7710846 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7710847 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7710848 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7710849 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7710850 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7710851 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7710852 can i ask what sort of advice and help you are providing
7710853 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7710854 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7710855 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7710856 given the widespread and sometimes involuntary exposure to smoke of burning incense these findings carry significant public health implications
7710857 besides initiatives to reduce incense smoke exposure future studies should be undertaken to identify the least harmful types of incense
7710858 based on these results we conclude that this new ethanol based hand sanitizer is a promising option for reducing the transmission of enteric viruses including norovirus by food handlers and care providers
7710859 the benefits of the program accrued very quickly and are very large
7710860 when adults stop smoking you see immediate benefits in heart disease with impacts on cancer and lung diseases starting to appear a year or two later
7710861 we confirmed these results with a wide range of model reliability tests and sensitivity analyses to make sure that the findings we found were not a result of some unobserved third factor
7710862 for example including differences between california and the control states on a variety of risk factors did not materially affect the results
7710863 the methods in this study can be used to forecast future costs and will provide important additional means for validating program evaluations that previously did not exist
7710864 large scale tobacco control programs should be an integral part of the medical cost containment that everyone agrees must be part of any health care reform
7710865 our study suggests that compounds such as sulforaphane from broccoli may help counter processes linked to the development of vascular disease in diabetes in future it will be important to test if eating a diet rich in brassica vegetables has health benefits for diabetic patients we expect that it will
7710866 sports is one of the most popular interests in the school this can be seen by the fact that the athletes needs are met through designing special programs consideration of their needs consideration of their teachers competitions and placing the school athletics program high on our list of priorities
7710867 sports is as popular a subject as communications and electronics but sports raise school pride while other areas of study do not
7710868 they are cognizant of their own needs but not the needs of others its not a good part of their character or their personality the contempt for others their condescending behavior and their feeling of superiority
7710869 for young athletes those that are active in sports leagues and primarily those that represent their school there are unique needs that require special handling given that the focus on athletic achievements and the pride they bring the school could harm other educational values that students should be taught
7710870 if we could prevent these infections in the first place or detect them sooner we might one day be able to prevent some of these premature births
7710871 to find that this amniotic compartment which we have traditionally viewed as somewhat sacrosanct is infected significantly more often than we thought is a little shocking
7710872 weve become very good at growing some bacterial species what might be called the weeds of the microbial world
7710873 but many other species cant be cultured by current methods
7710874 although we know now that humans should respect and even cherish their microbial symbionts
7710875 this type of infection reflects a situation in which our microbial companions have overstepped their bounds something has gone awry with this balance
7710876 certain reproductive factors may have a greater impact on risk of certain molecular subtypes of disease compared to others
7710877 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that homo sapiens were more advanced than neanderthals
7710878 it was only by spending three years in the lab learning how to physically make these tools that we were able to finally replicate them accurately enough to come up with our findings
7710879 me gusta el reto del 2012 hay talento y estoy seguro que llegar n en un buen momento la mayor a de ellos hay que ver que germ n s nchez y marlene s nchez tuvieron un debut muy j venes y f cilmente pueden ir a tres juegos ol mpicos m s

7710886 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7710887 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7710888 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7710889 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7710890 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7710891 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7710892 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7710893 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7710894 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7710895 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7710896 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7710897 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7710898 i prefer to think that god is not dead just drunk
7710899 es la idea tener a la misma base de jugadores y aunque sabemos que ser muy dif cil se har el esfuerzo necesario para que as sea ya que todos en la organizaci n queremos el bicampeonato
7710900 this is because small scale fisheries employ more than 12 million people world wide compared to half a million in the industrial sector
7710901 and because small scale fisheries use less fuel to catch fish
7710902 small scale fisheries use fishing gear that are more selective and far less destructive to deep sea environments
7710903 as a result they discard very little unwanted fish and almost all of their catch is used for human consumption
7710904 for the amount of resources invested we havent seen significant decrease in demand for species for which the global stocks are on the edge of collapse
7710905 market based initiatives while well intentioned unduly discriminate against small scale fishers for their lack of resources to provide data for certification
7710906 its an unfair disadvantage that in any other industry would have had people up in arms
7710907 but small scale fishers are often in developing countries and have very little political influence
7710908 without subsidies most large scale fishing operations will be economically unviable
7710909 small scale fishers will have a better chance of thriving in local markets and global fish stocks will have an opportunity to rebound
7710910 i just remind them that its 200 years behind schedule
7710911 it provides a true connection along woodward between the riverfront and grand circus park campus martius is that beacon youll see from the hart plaza youll be drawn there because of the constant programming and the fact that it is within walking distance once youre here it can be the springboard up woodward and beyond when you start making those urban connections walking in cities becomes fun and not such a chore
7710912 the human scale is something that weve missed the boat on in detroit development campus martius incorporates design elements which work
7710913 see there over by the fountain youll notice that the chairs are more likely to be turned around facing the water within a couple of feet most fixed benches would be placed some distance from the fountain but having the freedom to move these chairs gives you the option to go right up to the water
7710914 if we werent so car dependent and had better access to mass transit washington boulevard would have been ok
7710915 the proportions are right and work well together also the details are good with the historical streetlight replacement lamps lending a pedestrian scale and added beauty
7710916 feeling good in a city is about a city looking good and taking care of itself just being clean and well maintained is huge having storefronts that are actively programmed helps tremendously too
7710917 its about promoting that sense of cared for urban place that can make all of the difference in terms of someones positive experience in the city
7710918 here is the letter of support of koda extended to soren to form the new upa government in the state he is not outside the upa fold
7710919 all the independents are masters of their will relationships do get sour but my decision to support soren is aimed at saving the unity of upa
7710920 but i have respected guruji always i appeal to the next incumbent to complete all the works initiated during my regime i have discussed these matters with laluji and guruji
7710921 it will be of no value for koda and us he should clamour to get a ministerial berth
7710922 in politics there are no friends and foes but it is only opportunity people want to grab
7710923 facebook took the unfortunate decision to restrict most users from accessing scrabulous on august 22 in response to a take down notice from mattel on august 14
7710924 the high court had reserved judgement in this matter after hearing both parties it surprises us that mattel chose to direct facebook to take down scrabulous without waiting for the high courts decision
7710925 it is even more astonishing that facebook which claims to be fair and neutral party took the step even though they were fully aware of the circumstances under which the mattel letter was sent
7710926 whenever i do the scene i get emotional about my mother whom i lost last year
7710927 we unforgettable show have decided to light 1 billion houses in the world about 1 6 billion people in the world do not have electricity the lighting a billion lives campaign provides solar lanterns to people living in villages that dont have electricity
7710928 the democrat national convention opened up last night with prayer thats right the godless secularists arent actually godless at all why theyre just like the typical mid western voter
7710929 need to go 3 52 then 3 52 3 then higher
7710930 the idiots of the far left strike again this time in an effort to quell free speech and attack members of the press
7710931 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7710932 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7710933 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7710934 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7710935 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7710936 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7710937 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7710938 by this endorsement of obama very early he has really positioned himself strongly
7710939 esta batalla no la pueden ganar los delincuentes afirm jaque
7710940 una cosa es la sensaci n y otra es la realidad en los delitos lo que yo estoy convencido es que las dos cosas son malas
7710941 debemos dignificar la situaci n de muchos ciudadanos para evitar que el modo de vida sea el de la delincuencia esta batalla no la pueden ganar los delincuentes
7710942 para ello es necesario que se comprometa y trabaje toda la sociedad desde el vecino que se anima a denunciar cuando ve alguna actitud sospechosa hasta la tarea de la polic a y las entidades que contienen con diversas actividades a algunos miembros de la sociedad
7710943 no trabajar en la prevenci n llevar a que tengamos que lamentar situaciones como las recientes y aunque se esclarezcan los hechos y la ley coloque al responsable en la c rcel eso jam s puede reparar la p rdida de una vida
7710944 there was this trend where the amount of homework was equated with how rigorous your program was
7710945 what youre seeing in spring branch and in other places is a backlash to that
7710946 im not a believer in sending home 25 algebra questions as homework when five would let the teacher know if the student gets it
7710947 homework to be useful has to be graded and has to have prompt feedback it cant be done for completion only
7710948 it would be really nice to have some family time in the evenings to unwind to talk about your day
7710949 that doesnt mean that young children shouldnt be doing some homework
7710950 but the assignments should be short lead to success involve parents and demonstrate to kids that the things they are learning in school have applications to things they enjoy doing at home
7710951 anything that goes home for homework cannot be new material
7710952 it has to be something they have done before in class theres just not enough time in the day with all of the things we have to do to practice
7710953 students certainly are going to be expected to get things done on their own so thats an important skill
7710954 its kinda hard but thats my job to do it
7710955 we dont think that parade is going to enhance our image as the arts and cultural capital of new zealand
7710956 we dont want to make a big fuss over this event it isnt the type of high quality event we want wellington to be known for
7710957 most of our 1000 or so members would probably be happier if the event did not proceed but if it does we dont want the huge focus on it that was created by the controversy in auckland this year
7710958 we suspect that many auckland businesses likewise dont see the auckland parade doing much for aucklands brand either
7710959 we dont think that parade is going to enhance our image as the arts and cultural capital of new zealand
7710960 we dont want to make a big fuss over this event it isnt the type of high quality event we want wellington to be known for
7710961 most of our 1000 or so members would probably be happier if the event did not proceed but if it does we dont want the huge focus on it that was created by the controversy in auckland this year
7710962 we suspect that many auckland businesses likewise dont see the auckland parade doing much for aucklands brand either
7710963 there are still a lot of families that have experienced a lot of damage some of which is not covered by insurance we have a state disaster relief fund that is in desperate need of donations from folks that are willing to give
7710964 we want to do everything we can to help the families and individuals who suffered as a result of the tornado
7710965 were very aware that communities have spent considerable dollars in the recovery phase after the tornado and the floods and were very aware that many of them have budgets that are strained which is why were going to expedite the reimbursement process
7710966 anarchy media player wp spam plugin best free stuff computerworld
7710967 with a little extra work an attacker could probably do much more including send and read messages from a users account change privacy settings and add or delete facebook friends
7710968 take it or leave it offer confirmed telstras strategy to drive down wages and conditions and said staff were unlikely to receive the bonuses on offer
7710969 but in reality the vast bulk of employees will receive no bonus all telstra staff know from past experience that the companys performance pay scheme is unregulated and completely at the discretion of management he said
7710970 genuine collective bargaining with representation from unions was the only guaranteed way for employees to receive a fair deal
7710971 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalized in ecclesiastical life
7710972 hockey has been a driving force in my life as long as i can remember and i want to share my passion and knowledge to help other players better their skills there is nothing better than working hard and having it pay off my philosophy is that you are never too good to get better because even the pros practice
7710973 were not really at that point of westhoff returning because medically there are still things he has to take care of mike to me was a lot more than just a special teams coach i know that thats the most visible aspect of what he does but he was a really big asset in terms of game management penalties and some of the decisions i respect mike a lot he helped me a lot and im not opposed to mike coming back in some capacity
7710974 if i was a giant id do whatever i could to get him out and have him back on my team
7710975 the guy still looks great wouldnt that be something he comes back and we start a trend

7710980 i decided to pull the old car out of the garage and see how i felt today get some of the dust off of it
7710981 i felt pretty good im feeling a lot better 100 percent i didnt have any limitations going either way right or left i jumped up and made a few catches
7710982 im just trying to get back to my old self getting off the line full speed and being able to accelerate when the ball is in the air im trying to get all the kinks out of the armor im basically trying to get into the best playing shape that i can and get my cardio up i hope i feel pretty good today

7710986 grossly unsubstantiated we have found no evidence to support the sensational claims ultimately made by the reporter and newspaper
7710987 secure network protected by firewalls and governed by a strong information security policy
7710988 its an unfortunate outcome for what appears to be a smaller than reported data loss
7710989 in an ideal world companies ought to be looking at how they can prevent this sort of thing with the ultimate goal of not having to put out a retraction
7710990 yes they were in compliance with pci its a useful bar to meet but that doesnt guarantee loss prevention
7710991 its never really been known who owns manages or creates botnets
7710992 and to see an indictment of an individual for the operation of a botnet is a change it may indicate that authorities are now trying to do something to stop them
7710993 let there be no mistake about it we are united
7710994 i am asking you to those of you who supported me i will be forever grateful to work as hard for barack obama as you worked for me during the primary
7710995 hillary wants us to support obama the same we supported her and thats what we are gonna do
7710996 anyone saying anything else doesnt know what theyre talking about period
7710997 i feel pretty good about my chances especially now that ive got one of the finest statesmen in this country on my ticket
7710998 we will provide a government supported place for every eligible student who wants to train retrain or boost their qualifications in victorias training sector
7710999 now we have completely taken over nbt and i want more people to join them
7711000 as food fuel and rents soar pensioners particularly full single age pensioners can barely keep their heads above water
7711001 after a lifetime of contributing to the growth of this nation what sort of retirement is that for our most vulnerable australians
7711002 we estimate that about 550 staff across australia and new zealand will lose their jobs
7711003 about a third will be editorial and about two thirds will be other parts of the company not specified
7711004 its one of the most significant job losses in australia this year and its obviously going to have a serious impact on the ongoing quality of the companys papers magazines and websites in australia and new zealand
7711005 i dont think we need to keep this at the extreme end of where it is at the moment i think we should be able to wind that back somewhat before 2010
7711006 it should be wound back and if corporate australia doesnt think that then maybe we should apply it to corporate australia as well
7711007 we made an election commitment that we would get rid of it in january 2010 and thats exactly what we are going to do
7711008 thats what people expect thats what we are going to do
7711009 a lot of us are uncomfortable about this policy but it was a rudd labor commitment and kevin rudd confirmed that yesterday that its a promise he will be keeping
7711010 i dont think that impacts from the opportunity to explore what could be done in still respecting that promise
7711011 all that the leader of the opposition has done is undertake the kentucky fried chicken kfc marketing overhaul of queensland politics
7711012 a couple of years ago kentucky fried chicken knew that people were no longer interested in eating fried chicken their tastes were changing and so they sat around the marketing table and said lets change our name from kentucky fried chicken to kfc and maybe no one will notice that what were selling is oily greasy chicken
7711013 the leader of the opposition has gone out there and said well no one really wants to vote for the liberal and national party any more so ive got a great idea were not going to call it the liberal national party were going to call it the lnp and no one will notice that its the same group of people with the same old ideas the same greasy good old boys
7711014 i said that in the media to put some context around it
7711015 i was asked a question would it have been leaked from my department and i said no because it was actually written in my office so clearly it was leaked not from my department
7711016 one of the most successful police ministers this state has had for decades
7711017 there is somebody obviously who has access to that letter who thinks its pretty scintillating
7711018 im not sure who it was and frankly i dont care much because our government believes in getting on with the job
7711019 a real estate agent might describe it as having some rustic charm
7711020 we are concerned by indiscriminate weapons fire by sudanese government forces on the kalma internally displaced persons camp in south darfur sudan
7711021 attacks on vulnerable populations in sudan are deplorable and violate international law
7711022 the united nations urges restraint and calls for the immediate establishment of a humanitarian corridor so that the injured may be evacuated
7711023 severely threaten the safety and security of civilians who have a right to protection under international humanitarian law
7711024 the government forces still surround the camp there is no fighting now but tension is high throughout the camp
7711025 this morning security forces surrounded kalma camp and demanded that every idp internally displaced person leave
7711026 later they opened fire on the eastern side of the camp we have 27 confirmed dead including five women and two children
7711027 government forces killed 25 idps this happened before the eyes of the hybrid force i urge the international community to protect idps
7711028 shortly after we got calls from sheikhs who said those officers had already positioned themselves in the camp and that shots were fired
7711029 our people are inside kalma we are taking a leading role in coordinating organising a convoy of the wounded negotiating with the government and working to ensure a positive outcome to this crisis
7711030 we are in contact with all the parties to find a lasting solution
7711031 when you win in three sets it is a good results
7711032 i had some difficult moments in the match so that is going to help me be prepared for the pressure moments later on
7711033 i was trying to stay focussed as well as i could
7711034 its a matter of how fresh i can stay for this tournament
7711035 i want to get some rest and make sure i dont practise as much as i did in beijing i need to save some energy for this tournament
7711036 i tried to keep my level up i tried to hurry him
7711037 he was hitting his forehand really hard and making me do a bit of running
7711038 it was a decent test and i came through it pretty well
7711039 there have been some great performances from a lot of players this year but we dont have anything like justine who was able to win every single tournament
7711040 in the first set i felt like i was playing against a wall
7711041 in the second set i told myself to just play your game and dont give up
7711042 i ncisive investigation bacons timely analysis is as cool and competent as his labor advocacy is unapologetic in mapping the political economy of migration with an unwavering eye on the rights and dignity of working people bacon offers an invaluable corrective to americas hobbled discourse on immigration and a spur to genuine creative action

7711044 while valero was sending its workers for medical screenings after the blast residents of the manchester community were absorbing fumes coughing profusely and turning ill
7711045 regardless of their public relations mouthpieces valero is not a community player
7711046 my mother was coughing she couldnt stop coughing all i could do was leave the area luckily we have insurance but most of the residents in manchester are uninsured and cannot afford a simple

7711067 the government is still safe and sound and the cabinet meeting will be held at government house tomorrow
7711068 until we can drive this puppet government out of office
7711069 if the government is still stubborn the state enterprise may use the toughest measures to cut the power and water supply at government house
7711070 the raw material prices have been going up since five years ago and the prices are now five times higher however we are still able to keep the margins
7711071 when we began planning ie8 we took a hard look at our customers concerns about privacy on the web
7711072 many users are concerned about so called over the shoulder privacy or the ability to control what their spouses friends kids and co workers might see
7711073 if you are using a shared pc a borrowed laptop from a friend or a public pc sometimes you dont want other people to know where youve been
7711074 you know as well as i do this feature is built for porn
7711075 to lock everyone into a porn bucket makes people who have alternate privacy needs think that theyre doing something wrong
7711076 we want users to not only be able to enter a private browsing session but tell the browser that they want to delete all evidence starting a couple of hours ago

7711150 when does he have time to overhear conversations when hes with you all the time
7711151 sora being called a nice guy is usually the number one sign that someone isnt in to you
7711152 i heard leon and rude talking about reno the other day leon said something about all the time he and irvine spend together and rude said that it was passing thing
7711153 just cause i hear the stuff doesnt mean i get it
7711154 that theres still hope if rude doesnt think whatevers going on with reno and irvine is going to last you can use that

7711159 i dont know what it is about him but hes just totally taken over my life
7711160 well i dont know if itll help but i have a few ideas you can try to get his attention
7711161 so when are you gonna get over this jealously thing

7711163 people grow apart i know that rikus doing his thing and im doing mine
7711164 okay so maybe i am taking it out a bit on denzel but well if riku has all this time to hang out with him i dont get why some of that time cant be spent with me you know
7711165 riku sees denzel almost like a i dont know godson or something
7711166 denzel is pretty much clouds foster kid hes the one who brought him in and denzel looks to him as a father figure so riku by default as clouds boyfriend is acting in a similar position
7711167 considering you just called him a mingin id say yeah
7711168 im gonna have to go apologize to him riku too

7711176 i noticed the two of you sitting in here and told reno i was going to pick up a few almond cookies for the boss

7711214 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7711215 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7711216 we just think it is a recipe for some type of disaster to occur dequine said

7711224 then had the churches rest throughout all judea and galilee and samaria and were edified and walking in the fear of the lord and in the comfort of the holy ghost were multiplied
7711225 therefore since a promise remains of entering his rest let us fear lest any of you seem to have come short of it for indeed the gospel was preached to us as well as to them but the word which they heard did not profit them not being mixed with faith in those who heard it

7711231 in a way we want to be selfish because we love our life but we know how much that adds to it
7711232 thats just shooting the lights out its a big pie so small and medium sized operators can find themselves in niches that arent being serviced well by the big companies we are struggling to keep pace with our customers
7711233 we have less than half than 1 of the telecommunication sectors revenue on that basis our opportunity for growth is big weve barely scratched the surface
7711234 its a very strong provision and certainly stronger than the federal governments proposal
7711235 the concepts of market power and taking advantage are replaced with one straightforward test of market share and there was no doubt replacing the hurdle with two was going to make it very difficult to prove predatory pricing
7711236 it creates a bit of uncertainty and a false dawn for small business that in a legitimate competitive environment they think they are being predatory priced when they are not
7711237 these things written on the back of a beer coaster out in birdsville need to be tested
7711238 if it stays then i think it is uncumbent on the accc to test it and see what the courts have to say
7711239 market share has always been a determinant of market power it is well understood analysts look at it all the time so it is understood and has always formed part of competition law analysis
7711240 trinity has given well over 100 000 in support of its partnership with us and in 15 months of regular meetings with jeremiah wright we always found him to be a man of gracious hospitality humor generosity who paid attention to detail but also a man who does not call attention to himself
7711241 when youre euro american blog editor pc for white the people at trinity ucc are so exceedingly gracious warm and welcoming
7711242 the scope of their concern and outreach is extraordinary its really just an outstanding congregation
7711243 they firmly believe in the uccs commitment to an educated seminary trained clergy
7711244 and they have probably had more people feeling the call to ministry than any other church in the denomination
7711245 that leads to the denial that jesus christ is the son of god i would speculate

7711249 it would be nice if they had a couple of young position players like the mets murphy and evans coming in the system but they do not they do not have a first baseman to replace jason giambi or an impact center fielder or a shortstop to spell and eventually replace derek jeter or a second baseman who could enable them to deal the enigmatic cano while he still has value the reason they dont have any of these players in their system is because they continue to do a terrible job of scouting and developing they spend millions more in latin america than almost every other team and yet the only position players from there to make the big club over the last 10 years are alfonso soriano cano and melky cabrera the draft an even bigger disgrace jeter in 1992 is the last player they drafted who became a regular and the beat goes on in this years draft the yankees took pitchers with their first three picks no 1 gerrit cole whom they did not sign because their scouts obviously didnt get to know the kids makeup or his family situation no 2 jeremy bleich whos going to need tommy john surgery and no 3 scott bittle whose arm problems were so severe they elected to pass on signing him after a while you have to wonder what fatal attraction cashmans player evaluators have with injured pitchers last year they took north carolina state righthander andrew brackman in the first round knowing he was going to miss all of this season with tommy john surgery and then of course theres the immortal humberto sanchez purportedly the key return player in the gary sheffield deal with detroit who also underwent tommy john surgery and is still rehabbing somewhere cashman keeps stockpiling pitchers who come up hurt or fall on their face when they get to the big leagues enough he is banking on the offense coming back next year even though everyone will be a year older and there is nobody to step in when the inevitable injuries come off the way this season has gone with young homegrown teams such as the rays and twins giving their owners so much more bang for their buck the yankees returning to power would be an even bigger surprise

7711332 if we all worked on the assumption that what is accepted as true is really true there would be little hope of advance
7711333 its so rare because theres such a macho mentality with male elite sports

7711404 we are also looking at improving the social aspects of life in our housing complexes through the community action programme which is an integral part of the upgrade project
7711405 community action is all about fostering better community relations with an emphasis on socially improving the lives of our residents with what suits them best as a community

7711418 he has not been bouncing back and forth like favre
7711419 he has been pretty happy we saw him up here and he said he missed it but he was content he has decided to go on to the next phase of his life so i dont look too strongly into that him playing again

7711606 in doing so this company has fallen far short of meeting the high business standards that iowans expect
7711607 there will be no industrial jungles in iowa on my watch
7711608 in the end we are certain that the governor will see firsthand that our plant is anything but a jungle and that when all the bitterness of the last few months is taken out of the equation that we are indeed on a course to being on an even higher road
7711609 all iowans not just those who work within his administration have a right to know the level of the governors concerns and the fact that their government is acting responsibly in response to the disturbing reports
7711610 you listen and you listen good assholes you may be safe on the outside but in this office here i run the fucking show dont cross me and stay out of my way or ill cut you got it

7711634 how he blended his family life with his art and how his abstraction was not from nothing actually informed by reality yet two steps removed
7711635 the idea of people using their creativity to put something of themselves into what theyre making
7711636 why use something poorly designed when people make things with great care style design and quality
7711637 what i would like to see is people buying things they really like and connecting with the artists it doesnt take a lot of money to get something you like it doesnt seem part of the minnesota way to collect art sad to say
7711638 unless i am really moved by it so its much more an expression of myself
7711639 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7711640 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7711641 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7711642 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7711643 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7711644 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7711645 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7711646 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7711647 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7711648 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7711649 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7711650 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7711651 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7711652 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7711653 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7711654 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7711655 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7711656 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7711657 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7711658 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7711659 another nuclear power plant would bring down the price of peoples monthly energy bills
7711660 it is going to be significantly different than it was in the 1970s
7711661 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7711662 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7711663 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7711664 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7711665 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7711666 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7711667 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7711668 who are open to doing something on the production side
7711669 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7711670 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7711671 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7711672 i believe in the concept of formation through action the more actions people get involved in the more things happen
7711673 we want the republicans and the democrats to see that the majority of people in this country dont support this war and want to bring about an end to it
7711674 we werent just a study group we used the observe judge act technique
7711675 it had a big impact on my life in terms of social justice and race relations in the united states
7711676 i can do all the scheduling for rasoulis speaking tour and the organizing on computers nowadays and ill have my phone
7711677 what if we had a vision and could throw it out there to other people and be an example
7711678 we want people to look at st paul and kindness and take ownership of it
7711679 when you give out kindness and it doesnt have to be material it can be anything it comes back to you
7711680 not always and not always soon but it comes back to you
7711681 its so important to bring people together at the grassroots level instead of from the top so its about inviting them in and making them part of something because we all long to belong
7711682 its exciting the kindness thing is starting to catch on
7711683 you appreciate the mountain when youve been in the valley
7711684 a lot of people can focus on holding onto sadness instead of hope
7711685 i mean once in a while you have to go back there and go through the mourning but then you have to switch gears and its all about what you focus on
7711686 my dad always said i trust you i trust you i believe you and you can do anything and that has influenced everything i do i mean give a person a reputation and theyll live up to it
7711687 instead of mourning for him i mourn for the people who didnt get a chance to know him
7711688 the point of the program isnt to make activists out of everyone but activism just naturally comes out of it
7711689 it deepened my faith and it really deepened my understanding of injustice in the world
7711690 this is really a group effort by one of the most well connected group of people that ive ever worked with anytime you need something someone comes up with a name and a contact
7711691 as a peace team by definition you are unbiased about the outcome of an event
7711692 we really want to provide a service to the people to protect peoples safety and human rights and we hope to continue to be useful in this beyond this event
7711693 people are really happy that someones doing this from a positive perspective and its gratifying to hear that
7711694 hopefully people can use the nonviolent modes of communication not just at the rnc but also in their daily lives at the grocery store with their families
7711695 ive always had a calling or compassion for people who are struggling in the world
7711696 it just became clear that you have to understand other peoples perspective
7711697 its time for low income families across america to stand up and stand together
7711698 we need to demand that our voices are heard and that the daily human rights violations we are experiencing are exposed and ended
7711699 now is the time for all of us to come together
7711700 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7711701 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7711702 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7711703 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7711704 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7711705 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7711706 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7711707 we have a pretty significant fund and we have the ability to replenish it
7711708 largest and fastest growing companies in the american seed industry
7711709 as you can see from the half smirk half smile on my face im still enjoying the seed business
7711710 there are tremendous opportunities in various levels of our food system
7711711 there are opportunities besides acquiring ever more acreage and more capital investment
7711712 you look at the system and fix the system rather than coming in after theres a problem and using a synthetic solution consumers appreciate that
7711713 ive talked to several friends who are going to vote with their fork
7711714 rashids sister picked it up and accidentally pulled the trigger his sister is a very active child it all happened so quickly it was a terrible accident and we are hoping and praying he recovers he is my life
7711715 were monitoring the track of gustav and reviewing our destructive weather plans and procedures
7711716 im just going to stay in my house and watch out for it
7711717 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7711718 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7711719 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7711720 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7711721 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7711722 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7711723 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7711724 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7711725 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7711726 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7711727 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7711728 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7711729 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7711730 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7711731 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7711732 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7711733 imagine if theres something wrong with my baby we dont have insurance we depend on medi cal for her
7711734 theres a massive amount of paperwork to fill out not only that you start receiving notices in the mail it gets very confusing and i have a college education
7711735 it would save the state about 25 million but compared to a quarter million kids who would lose health insurance its not really a good trade off
7711736 none of us is happy to be in the position of having to change premiums of having to look at eligibility
7711737 i just care about my baby just to make sure theres something for her even knowing theres nothing for me
7711738 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7711739 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7711740 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7711741 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7711742 lo dif cil en la primera ronda no es ganar si no jugar bien
7711743 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7711744 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7711745 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7711746 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7711747 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7711748 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7711749 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7711750 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7711751 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7711752 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7711753 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7711754 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7711755 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7711756 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7711757 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7711758 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7711759 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7711760 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7711761 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7711762 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7711763 i cant explain why i was never able to say to him what i wanted to say that he was a great actor everyone else said it a thousand times over but i never managed it once i told him i loved him that came quite easily and he believe me and was emotional about it but i was afraid to say spencer youre a great actor hed only say now what the hell kind of thing is that to come out with he wanted to know it he needed to know it but he didnt want you to say it just think it and maybe that was one of the reasons he was a great actor he thought and listened better than anyone in the history of motion pictures a silent close up reaction of spencer tracy said it all

7711773 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7711774 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7711775 weset ourselves very stretching targets to get one billion poundsin sales of local products by 2011 people are cash strapped butour numbers are bang on target

7711785 as with any resort destination the property market in samui is dependant on repeat high end tourism as such deteriorating global economic conditions and weaker tourist activity could adversely affect this market in the short run

7711789 nah 20 persen dari sisa itulah yang kita masukkan sebagai anggaran pendidikan kira kira rp 90 miliar atau 2 kali lipat dari anggaran sekarang

7711804 we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7711805 that which is hateful to you do not do to another the rest of the torah is all commentary now go study
7711806 audio panton cogito singularis listen to everything think for yourself
7711807 and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7711808 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans our country will be committed to his cause the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7711809 i think this is his final hurrah to the party his final gift to the party
7711810 this was his way to maybe help quell a mini revolt among the delegates he likes barack obama and hes worried about the clinton factor hes now going to be the story of this convention at least until obama gives his acceptance speech and this should completely silence whatever dissension exists
7711811 may have accomplished more in the senate than some presidents did in the white house
7711812 hes the last link to that promising new frontier generation of the 1960s when the world seemed pliable when we were going to make the world a better place when we were going to battle poverty and racism and fight for peace
7711813 i am concerned about the length of time it took to notify the public about this escape
7711814 these people are considered dangerous and could possibly be armed so we are asking the public please do not approach them
7711815 they were in custody for a range of offences ranging from property offences to serious violent offences
7711816 were doing an internal review to get those details and know what happened we take these all seriously and work with the rcmp
7711817 this escape was from the middle portion built in the 1960s not the 1913 portion
7711818 im unable to comment at this time if infrastructure had anything to do with the escape
7711819 we wanted to make sure we had our information correct and that we then got it out as quickly as possible to the public
7711820 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7711821 we dont need an illusion of partnership when they surround us by bases from all sides they drag more and more states into the north atlantic bloc and they tell us dont worry everythings fine of course we dont like that
7711822 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7711823 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7711824 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7711825 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7711826 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7711827 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7711828 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7711829 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7711830 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7711831 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7711832 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7711833 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7711834 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7711835 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7711836 the focus on military measures is distracting the government from the crucial initiatives that are needed elsewhere
7711837 it is true that governments in different countries when in elections tend to push the arctic sovereignty button

7711844 while the motley rice three attorneys rail about the paint companies they fail to mention that they crafted their case only to sue out of state pigment companies
7711845 their statement in the oped that the rhode island supreme court didnt follow established law is not accurate what is accurate is that there had never been a case before based on a collective nuisance in which the plaintiff didnt have to show a specific location and who caused the nuisance
7711846 what we do know from earlier articles is that when fitzpatrick suggested attempting to use public nuisance in that fashion those at the motley rice firm considered it too much of a stretch to work initially
7711847 and we all have to wonder about the effectiveness of their alleged concern about children
7711848 i ask and perhaps we all should why is it that no family and no child has ever retained the motley rice firm to litigate for them is this firm not truly children centric

7711862 but hamlet is so much better in the original klingon
7711863 excuse i was reading this and wanted to tell you
7711864 ahh cool now we know why this or that happened
7711865 i dont spend a lot of time worrying about stuff like that
7711866 the questions posed to mr bonds by two different prosecutors at his grand jury appearance were imprecise redundant overlapping and frequently compound
7711867 not to be a hypocrite but ever since ive been here ive wanted to be able to pound the football and we havent yet
7711868 so were going to find out because were going to pound it and the only way to find out is getting the big boys up front to get off the ball and hand it off to those backs i like all of them i like all of those backs youve got to keep fresh legs out there at half back and keep pounding it
7711869 it will help the play action pass it will get guys open in the intermediate routes and it will help the pass protection because people are going to have to worry about stopping the run first
7711870 golden obviously is the fastest guy we have and mike has been good in everything hes done since hes been here
7711871 floyd is still a freshman but hes been good in everything hes done
7711872 in the meantime robby has tweaked his ham and george has tweaked his ham so as those guys get fully healthy there are other guys that arent waiting for them to take their spots golden and mike are going to have to get beaten out theyre clearly three four
7711873 but hes gotten so much better than what he was
7711874 i talked to him today about what i want him to work on this week as he continues his progression coming in and out of routes there have been a number of times when hes running he turns back and looks for the ball and he slows down so thats our point of emphasis with him this week
7711875 its not so much running the 15 yards to get to where hes turning around its getting to that spot and when you start looking for the ball going full speed so the quarterback knows where youre going to be
7711876 golden has great ball skills hes got great speed and hes tough
7711877 so once you get him to that point youre going to have a receiver that can do just about everything
7711878 just like kyle rudolph is able to run down the field faster than the other tight ends braxston is very strong hes probably the strongest of all the centers just brute strength
7711879 but hes also the least experienced of the centers most times youre playing with a guy in your face right on your head and when those centers get pushed back it doesnt bode well for the running game or the passing game
7711880 braxston looked the best for extra points and field goals and kevin has looked the best for punts actually there are a couple of other guys the guy that looks like he has the promise to be the best of all of them is darius fleming but hes got a lot of things on his mind between pass rushing and playing on special teams he has a lot of promise
7711881 i think we were nervous going into the match and it showed we played poorly
7711882 but thats why were looking forward to this season and hopefully going past that point
7711883 itll be a challenge for us but its going make us better come sectionals and perhaps regionals
7711884 were a young team but id like to see us contend for a league title
7711885 id also like to see us get more involved with club because it definitely helps we had three over the summer and you can see the improvement in practices of those who played club
7711886 this years team is fairly young but shows a lot of promise
7711887 stephens come in quicker and more aware of what he needs to do which is attack and block at the net
7711888 stephen took his lumps his first couple of years on the varsity because he was so much younger but hes always handled himself well hes a smart kid
7711889 barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation

7711896 the questions posed to mr bonds by two different prosecutors at his grand jury appearance were imprecise redundant overlapping and frequently compound
7711897 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7711898 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7711899 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7711900 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7711901 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7711902 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7711903 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7711904 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7711905 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7711906 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7711907 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though
7711908 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7711909 because of the media and the fans theres more energy or electricity in the ballpark but you cant bring in a pitcher an inning earlier they dont give you two wins when you beat the yankees so you cant do it differently
7711910 if we put on a run here theres no question we can make it
7711911 theres no question with the number of games we have left its possible
7711912 im just glad at this juncture its at yankee stadium
7711913 im looking forward to it thats what you play baseball for is that type of atmosphere those type of games
7711914 i guess i felt more of that during the all star game because it was an all star game and you had time to maybe think about things
7711915 when were playing the team were just trying to beat them thats really what i care about i dont get too caught up in the other stuff
7711916 we didnt want to disrupt business on the 14th floor
7711917 spread like wildfire it was funny cause when i went back to city hall my colleagues were upset with me
7711918 he said the reason i got lost is because it looks so good
7711919 snoop made the point if theres a football bowl at the kroc center we can do it right in long beach
7711920 he even said i can come up with a song for the kroc center thats amazing
7711921 hes there hes trying so we can help point him in the right direction
7711922 kind of like the magic johnson model theres tourists who jump out and take pictures at vip records imagine if he had his own store
7711923 sports stuff he went to the sports section and checked out a sports almanac and then he signed autographs for the kids

7711934 when the numbers were high i would get stopped in the street maybe once a week
7711935 now that the viewing figures are lower on the tv everywhere i go someone will come up to me and say what a huge fan they are that just tells me that people watch the show in a more modern way and that it has reached its sort of critical mass
7711936 tivo had just sort of taken off this was four or five seasons ago and because we were on friday nights most people most fans dont watch it on first run they tivo it and watch it a zillion times
7711937 in fact i dont think we ever go into space
7711938 its really about big business the machinations and the subterfuge that go on inside of it when you have something that is groundbreaking and could change the nature of life and the future
7711939 i pledge to you that i will be there on the floor of the senate next january
7711940 im here tonight to pay tribute to two men who have changed my life and that of america barack obama and edward kennedy
7711941 he and his wife vicki have taught us all about dignity courage and the power of love
7711942 it is so wonderful to be here nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7711943 so many of you have been with me in the happiest days and the hardest days
7711944 we have seen victory and defeat but we have never lost our belief that we are called to a better country and a better world

7711952 that may not seem impressive compared to package titles that sell in the millions but compared to other digital titles that is a friggin juggernaut
7711953 the bar has been raised and you have let developers around the world know that if they invest the time money and heart into making and remaking some great games you will support that initiative
7711954 a baby is gods opinion that the world should go on
7711955 maybe i should pull that one closer to the warehouse door
7711956 it should be in that far corner if im not mistaken
7711957 back when i had all this room and nothing to fill the void with i just assumed to start in a corner and work my way to the other side that was many years prior to this point in this one though many forgotten instances put aside goals and care free kiddy ideology have cluttered up the spaces between here and there
7711958 these walls are sturdy for the interim and ever reinforced i am safe from myself for another day
7711959 i want as much time as i can get with the guys and now im limited with their two situations
7711960 were going to do everything we can to get ready whatever it takes
7711961 if we dont have a full game plan in because were not comfortable with some of the stuff that theyd normally run had they had a full offseason to work out and get ready then well go with a smaller game plan and figure out what works best for us
7711962 codependents are more oriented to other peoples reality than their own
7711963 they can tell you what everybody else is feeling or needing but have no earthly idea what they want or need they are the finder fixer and mother theresa that is how they see themselves and where they get their ego fix
7711964 are you literally giving for fun and for free or to get some kind of payoff
7711965 if youre codependent youre trying to be someones savior to make yourself feel good you give to them with an expectation of return after all ive done for you i get to tell you what to do with your life
7711966 codependent people can be obsessed with the pain and suffering of the other person
7711967 that allows them to sacrifice themselves its really learned self defeating behavior
7711968 they get super absorbed in the pain of others they have trouble setting limits in taking in that pain some empathy is wonderful but when you can feel the pain more than the person in pain feels it it hurts you
7711969 if you get close to someone else its very threatening to them
7711970 theyre calling you all the time when youre away do you still love me are you still there for me its a very unhappy way to live
7711971 in those gray areas of addiction workaholism housecleaning perfectionism religion computer games those are the telling signs is your family suffering because of what youre doing are you suffering
7711972 many codependent people were the favorite child because they did more took care of the sick parent got straight as cleaned the house
7711973 now they feel like a martyr victimized by doing it all the martyr has a sense of gratification but its not a soul satisfying gratification
7711974 shame is the core of the whole thing neglected children view themselves as dumb stupid worthless and defective
7711975 its ingrained into the fabric of their character its because the message they got as children was i dont matter im not important im not worth taking care of
7711976 when they get recognition they are embarrassed they have difficulty asking others to meet their needs they dont believe they are worthwhile or lovable
7711977 ask them who they are and men will give their job title women will say im a wife partner daughter mother they define themselves in terms of relationships a healthy person would say im an independent and adventurous person theres nothing wrong with being proud of your job or relationships but a healthy person should be able to identify characteristics beyond that
7711978 they are not really good at bonding they dont know how to bond in a constructive way that has a healthy dependency between two independent people they dont feel able to express their own feelings express a difference in opinion so bonding never quite works
7711979 the abuse ranges from emotional to sexual and physical abuse why do they go back because they feel so terrible about themselves that nobody else would want them
7711980 often the enabler feels guilty about the situation baron tells webmd
7711981 they care about the other individual in the relationship they know there is a good side to this person theyre hoping against hope that they can go back to the good times even when its blatantly obvious nothing will change
7711982 they have to get beyond their emotions and look at the history of behavior this has been a pattern when you can get past the emotions and examine facts write them down do a little timeline or a score card of bad behavior
7711983 guilt is vague and inactive and tends to paralyze you it is the opposite of anger and in reality you are really very angry you may be angry about old issues from your childhood anger will demand a response anger will make you active
7711984 los he reunido aqui a todos porque deseo con todas mis fuerzas matar a alguien

7712009 as bisa mengubah peta kondisi kawasan timur tengah jika bersedia mengubah pola pikir yang selama ini keliru
7712010 jalan menuju solusi bukan dengan cara menganut kebijakan main tongkat dan gertak cara itu sudah usang barat harus memahami benar tentang kawasan ini
7712011 pijakan dialog itu harus disepakati demikian pula tujuan dan butir butir kesepakatan yang hendak dicapai
7712012 hal yang dibutuhkan sekarang adalah semua pihak harus saling menjaga dan memerhatikan kepentingan satu sama lain di kawasan
7712013 jika prinsip itu yang dianut akan ada manfaat pada semua pihak dan peta kondisi kawasan ini akan berubah menuju stabil
7712014 saya selalu mengatakan diplomasi adalah pilihan pertama namun opsi militer tetap tersedia di meja
7712015 kawasan ini adalah kawasan yang paling tidak stabil di dunia saya tidak ingin kawasan ini menjadi tak lebih stabil dari sekarang

7712027 the wallace foundation has funded administrative training in other states for several years because research has shown the difference that qualified leaders make in struggling districts
7712028 we know that the key to strengthening our childrens education is to put a good teacher in every classroom and ensuring that we have innovative educational leaders is critical to supporting the efforts of our dedicated teachers
7712029 we are pushing this material to uk media channels eg a bbc radio programme exposing tensions between aq al qaeda leadership and supporters
7712030 and a restricted working group will communicate niche messages through media and non media
7712031 we are not claiming victory over aq we are stressing their declining support
7712032 the 40 year old had been in the police service for 18 years
7712033 several people took her away as she was leaving a work meeting sunday night
7712034 could it be that eichmann and his million accomplices in the holocaust were just following orders could we call them all accomplices
7712035 they finished today in arlington va we lost four in our company when we were down range in our last deployment
7712036 we would go to their police stations and show them how to defend their city against the insurgents
7712037 you know how to make yoghurt but you dont know anything about football
7712038 the presence of the international community in afghanistan must be reviewed through a mutual agreement
7712039 the authorities and responsibilities of the international forces in afghanistan must be regulated through a status of force agreement consistent with both international and afghan laws
7712040 air strikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians must be stopped
7712041 unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids
7712042 we can look at it as an army command issue
7712043 but it really comes down to a husband and wife issue
7712044 they say if he can do it i can too it happens a lot
7712045 if theres somebody here whos friendly to her and pays attention to her guess what shes real open to an affair
7712046 youve got dummies over there who either dont care or theyre trying to get back at their wives but me man its not worth losing your rank over your moneys your money
7712047 when theyre cheating its up to them to live with it because its eventually going to come out
7712048 theyll blame the deployments and the hardships and such i personally dont buy it
7712049 i know a number of soldiers who have deployed who have not cheated and to turn around and just if thats your excuse its a crutch and its a lie
7712050 i would really be hard pressed to say that infidelity is more prevalent in the military
7712051 i do not think thats an issue i seem to run into it as much in the civilian community as in the military community
7712052 what other business what other organization provides a family support group
7712053 joe cannot afford to deploy and question whats going on at the home front he or she has to concentrate on what the mission is while deployed
7712054 its like we recruit the soldier but we re enlist the family and the family needs to know that being part of the military is not going to be harmful to their marriage
7712055 some are in uniform some are in wedding dresses and suits some are in casual clothes
7712056 we just want to get it knocked out and go celebrate
7712057 and theyre not ready financially and they dont have maturity and they dont have the emotional skills for what it takes to be committed to a marriage
7712058 persons of senior status higher ranking officers and noncommissioned officers
7712059 most of my clients are persons of substance if you will
7712060 if infidelity takes place its because theres brokenness in another part of a persons life
7712061 an affair is just a dimension of a destructive addictive behavior lets get beyond the symptom what is it that is in you thats causing you to risk a great deal and do you have any evidence that this relationship the one you left or the one youve begun has eased the pain within your heart and your soul
7712062 soldiers can compartmentalize tune out the emotion in order to do their jobs effectively
7712063 they are traits that arent necessarily good for a relationship
7712064 its cumulative you can lose sleep one night maybe two but after a while your body shuts down
7712065 the operational tempo of the military is just wearing down the families
7712066 it has a number of adverse effects and one of those adverse effects is affairs
7712067 if theyre willing to work on it not just the affair but the underlying issues
7712068 it will never be like their old marriage but it will be their new normal
7712069 usually when theres a big deployment thats when i get most of my calls i get calls from afghanistan and iraq we get calls from everywhere
7712070 weve had some cases that would totally blow your mind
7712071 if she hadnt joined the army wed still be together
7712072 you cant deal with the flow the numbers are against you
7712073 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
7712074 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
7712075 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
7712076 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
7712077 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
7712078 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
7712079 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7712080 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7712081 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7712082 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7712083 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7712084 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7712085 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7712086 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7712087 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7712088 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7712089 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7712090 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7712091 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7712092 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7712093 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7712094 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up
7712095 it is one heck of a shame that he johnson was in less danger defending our country in iraq than in a college station bar where he was attacked by a band of thugs
7712096 the theory behind the design was to try to bring the american people into the process
7712097 but its an interesting question whether dazzling is what the obama campaign needs right now
7712098 did you read that bulletin comment or see that new picture
7712099 josh is just jealous that he didnt get to do mouth to mouth with him
7712100 living in vegas and making the trip over is a lot more difficult now that im older than it used to be when i was a young man
7712101 honestly this is the first time in a long time that ive actually felt my age i realize now that i cant go up to 100 kilos again i have to keep my weight under 195 pounds i have to
7712102 i made some big mistakes from my last fight in december i was supposed to fight in february it didnt happen i was supposed to fight in march didnt happen i was supposed to fight in may it didnt happen so i said okay screw it im just gonna to sit on the couch and i ate and i ate and i drank and i drank
7712103 i cant take time off and sit on the couch i dont have the rebound that another guy does
7712104 i thought that if it did go to the ground id be able to pass his guard and have better jiu jitsu than him his jiu jitsu game was a lot better than i thought it was going to be his submission attempts were very good hes very crafty
7712105 ive been saying this for a long time takimoto is a lot better than what people have been giving him credit for he has a really bright future in mixed martial arts
7712106 the ending for me in mma is always to be considered pound for pound one of the best guys to play the game
7712107 i think the sport especially in america is far behind what it is here in japan everyone understands whats going on in japan on the ground on the feet they understand submissions when takimoto had me in the kimura the crowd was cheering because they knew i was in a position that was dangerous in america more than likely theyd be yelling to stand em up being stupid not realizing the guy was almost done
7712108 imagination is the beginning of creation you imagine what you desire you will get what you imagine and at last you create what you will

7712116 is google making us stupid what the internet is doing to our brains
7712117 the net seems to be chipping away my capacity for concentration and contemplation my mind now expects to take in information the way the net distributes it in a swiftly moving stream of particles
7712118 you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free

7712124 a resource we hope will help resolve open questions of the bush era what did our leaders know and when did they know it and perhaps just as important what red flags did we miss and how could we have missed them
7712125 the question in my mind is how many additional american casualties is saddam worth
7712126 a resource we hope will help resolve open questions of the bush era what did our leaders know and when did they know it and perhaps just as important what red flags did we miss and how could we have missed them

7712128 is this original reporting cost a fortune it was produced under the old dying model of journalism wherein investigative reporting is funded by advertisements for cell phones new subdivisions mattress chain mega sales designer clothing and so on as mother jones has shown people who are passionate about telling a story have powerful new tools at their disposal to do so but without high quality content difficult time consuming intellectually demanding butt numbing sometimes actually dangerous reporting the tools are just toys
7712129 we already use recycled newsprint and soy based ink and recycle every bit of waste we can
7712130 we cut back on the number of sections and pages we print and deliver by more than 30 but the most important change the one that can really make a difference is getting our readers to join us in the biggest green revolution in the history of newspapers going paperless

7712133 newspaperdirects smartedition is loaded with features that will make this transition easier but we know it will take time for many of our subscribers to get used to it
7712134 the other part of the hybrid model is our web site which we will continue to improve as well
7712135 to my mind it is likely that what we now understand as the mass media will be gone within 10 years vanished without a trace
7712136 the next great american institution to find itself obsolete and outdated while obstinately refusing to change
7712137 as the wise man once said if youre going to make predictions make a lot of them
7712138 you know what an editor is worth the money because time is money and my time is wasted combing through this junk ill pay someone to do it
7712139 to my ears though that still sounds like the new york times

7712145 one of this eras most powerful myths is that we live in the information age
7712146 is the newspaper industry dying not now on an average day roughly 51 million people still buy a newspaper and 124 million in all still read one
7712147 no vamos a hacer desfilar a las monjas en traje de ba o

7712153 they would then get diversion a scheme for first offenders and the lesson would be learnt for the rest of their lives he said
7712154 the police said it was far too serious for diversion its gone far beyond what was intended
7712155 i am persuaded that young men setting out on their lives dont need convictions for such serious charges
7712156 this is a tragedy for everyone involved in this incident
7712157 im sure the assumption was made that the car was used to drive around the neighborhood to look for the children
7712158 certainly at this point we wish that the car was the very first place we looked but it was not
7712159 our broadband package promotes the best fit between the best available technology and the needs of users in the region concerned

7712169 entendemos bien que algunos medios est n m s interesados en los rumores de controversia que en la realidad de la unidad
7712170 la realidad es que nuestros equipos trabajan conjuntamente para que la convenci n sea coronada por el xito y van a continuar haci ndolo
7712171 la senadora y el ex presidente clinton apoyan totalmente la f rmula obama biden y tienen la intenci n de dirigirse a la convenci n y al pa s subrayando la gran importancia de una victoria en este oto o
7712172 cualquiera que diga otra cosa no sabe lo que est diciendo punto y aparte
7712173 mosc expresa sun sinceras condolencias a las familias de las v ctimas y llama a las fuerzas de la coalici n a tomar todas las medidas necesarias para prevenir ataques que provoquen bajas civiles
7712174 todos los aspectos del conflicto afgano deben respetar escrupulosamente las leyes internacionales incluidos los aspectos humanitarios
7712175 no comentar pol ticamente sobre esto s lo dir que el senador biden es obviamente un muy buen hombre de estado
7712176 hizo un gran trabajo en un largo per odo y yo s que apoy al departamento de estado de la secretaria rice
7712177 el concepto es muy distinto al que ha tenido esta administraci n y que promete continuar mccain
7712178 lo que es bueno para el pueblo de las am ricas tambi n lo es para estados unidos por tanto tenemos que ser un socio y no un salvador
7712179 la tradici n de los ltimos a os de imponer un modelo desde arriba y decir que washington tiene todas las respuestas para las preguntas de la regi n
7712180 si respetas la democracia tambi n debes hacerlo con los resultados
7712181 por la manera antidemocr tica en que gobierna el presidente hugo ch vez en venezuela su ret rica y pol tica antiestadounidense y sus intentos por influir en los procesos internos de otros pa ses
7712182 parte del problema ha sido el mal manejo por el gobierno bush que se enfrent ret ricamente a ch vez y celebr el intento de golpe de estado de 2002 eso le dio un impulso al presidente venezolano
7712183 la falta de pol tica concreta y de atenci n dej un vac o en la regi n para que ch vez tratara de llenarlo con su ret rica antiamericana con una diplomacia en base a d lares del petr leo
7712184 llenar el vac o que dej bush ofreciendo otra visi n y otra relaci n con todos los pa ses de la regi n

7712186 el senador obama no est decidido a quitar de la mesa cualquier herramienta que podr a ayudar a aumentar la libertad del pueblo cubano
7712187 ser a una oportunidad para decir a los gobernantes cubanos que si son serios y quieren cambiar las cosas en cuba el primer paso ser a liberar a los presos pol ticos sin condici n
7712188 estados unidos estar a entonces dispuesto a empezar un proceso de normalizar nuestra relaci n
7712189 sin proponer nada que cambiar a la situaci n actual en la isla

7712191 no solamente contra los sindicalistas sino contra otros l deres de la sociedad civil
7712192 israel afronta una amenaza muy real de ir n al igual que nosotros si ir n logra un arma nuclear le da a los iran es una tremenda ventaja en la regi n para continuar financiando a hizbol y ham s organizaciones terroristas
7712193 mi trabajo como presidente ser a tratar de asegurar que en cuanto a la diplomacia le apretamos las tuercas a ir n y que movilicemos a la comunidad internacional de forma seria contra su programa nuclear para aplicar sanciones de manera que ir n haga un c lculo distinto

7712195 oh you just want to have your cake and eat it too
7712196 the ineffable joy that can be had in pursuing the absurd
7712197 my head was so full of words that i often had trouble forming simple sentences out loud
7712198 and my speech became a curious jumble of obscure words and improper syntax
7712199 some days i feel as if i do not actually speak the english language
7712200 like trying to remember all the trees one sees through the window of a train
7712201 i find myself wondering why ive never seen this odd term that describes such a common article of clothing
7712202 sometimes i get angry at the dictionary and let loose with a muffled yell
7712203 the point at which i became bored has long since passed

7712210 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty
7712211 no foreign soldier remains in iraq after a specific deadline not an open time frame
7712212 any decisions on troops will be based on the conditions on the ground in iraq that has always been our position and continues to be our position
7712213 there is no agreement until there is an agreement signed
7712214 optimistic that iraq and the u s can reach a mutual agreement on flexible goals
7712215 we dont want the phrase time horizons we are not comfortable with that phrase
7712216 stopped talking about the withdrawal of combat troops we just talk about withdrawals
7712217 we are concerned by indiscriminate weapons fire by sudanese government forces on the kalma internally displaced persons camp in south darfur sudan
7712218 the united nations urges restraint and calls for the immediate establishment of a humanitarian corridor so that the injured may be evacuated
7712219 severely threaten the safety and security of civilians who have a right to protection under
7712220 the government forces still surround the camp there is no fighting now but tension is high throughout the camp
7712221 this morning security forces surrounded kalma camp and demanded that every idp internally displaced person leave
7712222 later they opened fire on the eastern side of the camp we have 27 confirmed dead including five women and two children
7712223 government forces killed 25 idps this happened before the eyes of the hybrid force i urge the international community to protect idps
7712224 shortly after we got calls from sheikhs who said those officers had already positioned themselves in the camp and that shots were fired
7712225 our people are inside kalma we are taking a leading role in coordinating organising a convoy of the wounded negotiating with the government and working to ensure a positive outcome to this crisis
7712226 we are in contact with all the parties to find a lasting solution
7712227 we are neither registered nor do we have any bank accounts
7712228 we hope that sharif will not cause us any pain nor that we will cause any pain to him
7712229 if the government is showing resolve they should be encouraged

7712239 over the last year woolworths has been repeatedly shamed for sourcing its paper products from the discredited asia pulp and paper app app is a company with an appalling environmental social and financial record woolworths has been repeatedly advised about its suppliers terrible behaviour yet continues to ignore the demands of consumers
7712240 the return of these doctors is a positive thing because we are suffering from a severe shortage of personnel and we welcome doctors willing to their country
7712241 2008 is the first year when production has reached the level prior to that of saddam husseins fall
7712242 the increase in the generation of electricity has been achieved by repairing some old plants and installing some new ones
7712243 distribution is now much improved as sabotage has been eliminated to a very high extent because the security situation is much better this has affected our network now most of the network is in operation
7712244 there are still some lines which were sabotaged two or three years ago and now we are trying to rebuild them
7712245 the capacity of iraqi power stations is actually far higher but plants are so outdated and in bad shape that they frequently shut slashing generation to less than half of the 13 000 mw of nominal capacity
7712246 we may face a very serious problem if we do not put in place new power generation
7712247 the need for energy will be much more we have millions of iraqis out if these people return to iraq this means that new projects would be needed this is a pressing need
7712248 he has authorised us to negotiate directly with companies of international standing
7712249 money is not a problem what we need is that big countries and big companies will consider that we cannot build the network alone somebody has to help us send technicians especially as security is now much better
7712250 the border between afghanistan and pakistan runs 2 500 kilometers 1 500 miles thats a huge area to maintain surveillance on

7712252 flying uavs hasnt been established yet as a career field
7712253 as it stands right now a lot of people who were only expecting to do three years are effectively not able to leave so that we can grow
7712254 its possible that they may not ever go back to their f 16s when they showed up that was their expectation that they would go back thats a tough fix
7712255 people think theyre smoking and joking in a casino somewhere

7712290 the new speaker will now determine when the parliament will be convened as for the talks on power sharing mugabe will now negotiate from a relative position of weakness his party not be in control of the parliament

7712506 tenemos la oportunidad de demostrar que estamos capacitados para luchar a este nivel y de llegar a la porter a contraria
7712507 tenemos el objetivo de ganar al bar a porque hasta ahora ning n equipo polaco ha logrado hacerlo queremos ser los primeros
7712508 ganamos a la campeona ol mpica de seis y con un sabor de boca muy bueno porque este bronce nos ha sabido a oro estoy incre blemente contento
7712509 atenas me trae muy buenos recuerdos pero lo vivido en pek n ha sido algo incre ble y adem s lograr subir al podio y recibir una medalla es algo que no se puede explicar
7712510 la clave del bronce fue jugar como equipo ese partido lo iba a ganar quien m s coraz n pusiera y nosotros pusimos todo el coraz n que ten amos
7712511 cuando hay uni n y compromiso se consiguen cosas grandes
7712512 no estamos de acuerdo con la resoluci n por supuesto
7712513 vayamos a ir m s lejos porque el tas ya ha dicho todo lo que ten a que decir
7712514 todo lo que hemos hecho en los ltimos cuatro a os estuvo dirigido a ganar un oro
7712515 la experiencia ha sido dolorosa pero lo vamos superando y ya les he dicho que lo que logramos es algo muy especial
7712516 la plata va a valer cada hora un poco m s y es algo para estar muy orgullosos
7712517 es incre ble no estoy acostumbrado a esto porque venimos de un deporte minoritario tanta gente haci ndose fotos es una experiencia nica
7712518 if this is your god hes not very impressive he has so many psychological problems hes so insecure he demands worship every seven days he goes out and creates faulty humans and then blames them for his own mistakes hes a pretty poor excuse for a supreme being
7712519 quiero agradecer el apoyo de todos los aficionados y la gente que nos sigue por todo este cari o al final merece la pena todo
7712520 m s o menos es una plata que sabe mejor que la del a o pasado en el europeo pero una plata es una plata y un oro es un oro igualmente estamos muy contentos de c mo han ido las cosas
7712521 me felicit por mi actuaci n por el partido y por el resultado y que nos vemos en los angeles
7712522 est arriba no s lo porque sea plata ol mpica ni campeona del mundo y subcampeona de europa sino porque est arriba en todos los torneos internacionales desde hace muchos a os
7712523 si est s hablando de eso quitas lo que realmente es un xito est s llorando porque no nos han pitado los pasos y creo que tenemos que estar sonriendo porque hemos hecho unos juegos ol mpicos magn ficos
7712524 trato a rafinha con toda normalidad ha entrenado e integra el grupo que viaja a madrid que vaya a jugar a n no lo tengo decidido
7712525 se ha incidido en los agarrones y codazos en las reas porque hay que ser mucho m s vigilantes respecto a ello porque es lo que pide el f tbol
7712526 when you lose a parent you feel defenseless against the world in terms of how really vulnerable we are as human beings so i thought telling it through a childs eyes was the way to go
7712527 stand up to cancer is an initiative of the entertainment industry and entertainment industry executives so a film challenge was uniquely appropriate since our whole ethos is about using creative expression and the media to galvanize the public to take action
7712528 im very happy we have three individual medals and that too without hockey
7712529 weve shown our potential in various sports here which is good for the commonwealth games in delhi
7712530 we will get a bagful of medals there and then we can go on to the 2012 london olympics
7712531 they have exceeded their medal target but we never achieve the goals we set for ourselves
7712532 most of the athletes are trained by our coaches but they have obsolete knowledge
7712533 we must get good systems in place to keep improving at present there is no real system
7712534 it is about spending it the right way having the right people in the right place at the right time
7712535 no puedo decir nada pero seg n lo que me ha comentado arg ello hay clubs que estar an dispuestos a presentar una oferta en firme
7712536 en bilbao nos cerraron el aeropuerto por un minuto y hubo que buscar hotel para equipo seguidores y prensa a la una de la madrugada
7712537 y en newscatle la guerra de irak nos jug una mala pasada porque el comandante casi no nos deja regresar porque hab an cerrado el espacio a reo y ten a a 40 periodistas sigui ndome por la terminal
7712538 van gaal controlaba todo hasta marcar las pautas actuales en los viajes
7712539 lo importante es que el bar a siempre es bien recibido
7712540 voy a estar muy atento de mis jugadores nos jugamos demasiado para ir y a tom rnoslo a la ligera
7712541 venimos aqu con mucha cautela y mucha precauci n si estamos a punto de jugar este encuentro es porque todav a no estamos en la champions de estar clasificados ahora estar amos en barcelona
7712542 antes de afrontar la eliminatoria pensaba que era el partido m s dif cil del a o ganamos 4 a 0 en la ida pero igualmente hay que tener en cuenta al wisla es un rival que me merece mucho respeto porque saben a lo que juegan y tienen muy buenos jugadores en la parte defensiva
7712543 como campe n de liga que son me merecen todo el respeto del mundo pero nosotros hemos venido a ganar el partido no s lo a pasar la eliminatoria
7712544 son jugadores de mucho nivel desde el primer d a su predisposici n ha sido total y hasta el momento todo lo que hemos hecho ha estado muy bien
7712545 soy feliz con la gente que hay pero tenemos la obligaci n de estar pendientes por si surge algo interesante en el mercado si es as y se adecua a nuestras necesidades iremos a por l
7712546 deben jugar los que est n mejores no los que son mejores yo siempre dar minutos a aquellos que me den m s confianza aunque aquellos que no jueguen no significa que no me la den
7712547 aun no me lo he planteado ahora lo m s importante es el wisla
7712548 es un tema zanjado hablamos con l y su comportamiento ha hecho que se quede con nosotros
7712549 ya pas est liquidado ahora toca hablar de la pelota si la cosa no va bien no hay que cargar las tintas contra el presidente la culpa es del entrenador y de los jugadores de momento las cosas van bien aunque habr alg n d a que vendr n problemas porque siempre los hay
7712550 a sheva no le puedo desear suerte en la lucha por el scudetto porque el milan va a ser uno de nuestros rivales en la competici n pero s le deseo que se proclame m ximo goleador de la copa de la uefa
7712551 cuando me fui al chelsea pensaba que era lo mejor para m y para mi familia pero ahora estoy muy feliz de volver al milan a n me queda mucho f tbol por delante y muchos goles por marcar
7712552 llego con muchas ganas a un equipo que tiene una gran plantilla y los objetivos muy claros s lo pido un poco de suerte porque s que tengo calidad para hacer bien mi trabajo
7712553 es un sue o pasar a la historia por algo as y tambi n una motivaci n
7712554 una medalla de plata no estar a nada mal pero yo voy pensando en la general
7712555 es un honor tenerlos en el equipo su apoyo me quita responsabilidad y presi n y me permite estar m s relajado de salida
7712556 leipheimer es un firme candidato a ganar igual que valverde aunque el gran favorito es sastre ya demostr su nivel en francia

7712563 eso son cosas del pasado y ya no quiero hablar m s de ello todos en alg n momento dado tenemos una opini n sobre algo o tomamos ciertas decisiones por el bien del equipo puedo comprender que guardiola dijera esas cosas de m pero estoy contento de estar aqu y no tengo que olvidar nada porque no ha pasado nada
7712564 tengo 27 a os llev mucho tiempo jugando al f tbol de la misma manera y no voy a cambiar ahora jugar de esta manera y ser as siempre me trajo xito a estas alturas no tengo nada que demostrar y lo nico que quiero es jugar a mi nivel para seguir ayudando a mis compa eros
7712565 estoy muy a gusto en el bar a siempre he sido claro con mis intenciones de seguir aqu y no pens en marcharme el club pod a tener sus ideas pero yo sab a que me tenia comportar como un jugador del bar a en todo momento
7712566 porque no estamos aqu para comparar sino para trabajar todos juntos para que la historia del bar a siga creciendo
7712567 la prensa especul mucho sobre m y sobre mi entorno cuando nosotros no habl bamos nunca hemos dicho nada y los que han hablado de posibilidades de futuro siempre ha sido la prensa
7712568 s que puedo dar m s y esto no es nada m s que el comienzo hace un mes que llegu y trato de adaptarme lo m s r pido posible

7712586 this race is one of the high profile races in the country because of mitch mcconnell and the image he has built as the chief obstructionist in the u s senate
7712587 he has been in lockstep with george bush he has blocked the efforts on the part of the democratic leadership in the senate to put forward progressive policy changes
7712588 so this race has a tremendous amount of attention and people have been asking us about it and talking about it everywhere we go
7712589 we know its a difficult race sen mcconnell has one of the largest warchests in the country
7712590 its an uphill battle for any democrat to take him on
7712591 on the other hand voters in kentucky recognize what republican policies have done to this economy and to our standing in the world

7712717 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world theyre the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning and the last thing i think about when i go to bed at night their future and all our childrens future is my stake in this election
7712718 and in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital ten years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
7712719 thats michelle my wife who is not only wise but shes honest and one of the things you need is somebody who can get up in your face and say boy you really screwed that one up
7712720 i think what she wants to accomplish is to show america that shes a mom shes a wife shes a businesswoman and that she is capable of being the first lady of this country
7712721 and her challenge tonight is to do that in the context of perceptions real or imagined that americans have of her some would say militant some would say anti american
7712722 michelle obama really needs to connect with ordinary people and she needs to promote her husband not herself
7712723 i think its also a factor that shes an educated professional black woman
7712724 its as if youre adding multipliers to this math problem this is someone whos had strong statements about race in america shes had strong feelings about how shes been treated by whites this really is a unique individual and so many of the issues and controversies that swirl around her might not pertain to every black woman who was going be a potential first lady but it does apply to her
7712725 the trip gives us an opportunity to move forward both here in the u s government and also with our counterparts in europe who want to support georgias economic and military reconstruction
7712726 developments lately in georgia have increased the importance of this visit
7712727 to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7712728 cheney certainly has had a tougher view on russia than some others in the administration
7712729 would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
7712730 russias reputation has suffered since it took these disproportionate military steps in georgia
7712731 we are concerned by indiscriminate weapons fire by sudanese government forces on the kalma internally displaced persons camp in south darfur sudan
7712732 attacks on vulnerable populations in sudan are deplorable and violate international law
7712733 do you really think nuns are all wizened funereal old ladies today its not like that any more thanks to an injection of youth and vitality brought to our country by foreign girls
7712734 one of the major reasons the protests snowballed to the levels weve seen
7712735 is that we allowed hard line islamists to run of the city allowing them to use mosques to broadcast appeals for people to come out on the streets our withdrawal also allowed them to pressure people otherwise unsympathetic to the secessionist cause to join the protests
7712736 were not here to establish long term permanent housing its going to be a challenge as we approach three years
7712737 the federal government has been absolutely dragging their feet in every way possible in not building affordable housing
7712738 theyve spent a lot of time energy and money tearing affordable housing down but not enough to build new affordable housing
7712739 well wind up with a new wave of homeless folks
7712740 we dont think any organisms belong in the amniotic sac
7712741 the president is on the cusp of conserving more territory than any leader has ever done thats an amazing legacy to leave the nation
7712742 these areas are host to some of the worlds most biodiverse coral reefs and habitat and some of the most interesting and compelling geological formations in all of our oceans
7712743 many areas in the proposed central pacific islands monument remain in a nearly pristine state
7712744 a recent study of kingman reef part of the proposed monument found a picture perfect healthy coral ecosystem that contained more fish than any other coral reef ecosystem in the world
7712745 the study also found that the area contains the worlds greatest proportion of top predators including sharks a key indicator of ecosystem health healthy reefs like those of the central pacific are also more resilient to changing climate
7712746 monument or sanctuary designation by itself does not necessarily convey a high degree of protection and could allow a host of activities including commercial and recreational fishing and deep sea mining among others
7712747 however if the president establishes these new sites as no take reserves where no extractive activity is allowed it would be one of the most significant environmental achievements of any u s president
7712748 parties will look not only at what is needed in terms of funding but also at how funding should be generated in the context of a new international deal and precisely what technologies are required
7712749 the debate will also give an indication of the infrastructure needed to implement a shared vision in the areas of finance technology and capacity building
7712750 really the safest thing you can do is make all your food at home from scratch period
7712751 sometimes we buy the product anyway and sometimes we dont
7712752 what does this really mean can i count on it as a consumer to really have any meaning
7712753 advisory labeling may not be protecting the health of allergic consumers
7712754 not suitable for consumption by persons with an allergy to x
7712755 maybe illustrates how difficult it can be when you have food allergies to stay on top of that information
7712756 this shocking incident underscores the terrible dangers and threats that continue to face journalists in somalia
7712757 we call for them to be set free immediately the somali authorities must act urgently to see our colleagues come to no harm
7712758 we are worried about their safety as we have had no contact with anybody saying they are holding the journalists and their driver
7712759 i didnt accept it out of choice it was against my wishes
7712760 my mother and uncle wanted it but he was good to me
7712761 i didnt accept it out of choice it was against my wishes
7712762 my mother and uncle wanted it but he was good to me
7712763 dammit i was started to do the same wrong thing again
7712764 a very clear effort on a national scale to discredit defame and intimidate ministries and preachers of what has been called the prosperity gospel
7712765 they are fearful not only of the moral imperative communicated by these ministries but the growing wealth and influence of those constituencies
7712766 bryan has been around a number of years now and he has been a good defenseman for quite some time
7712767 im excited about bryans willingness to come here on a tryout it will certainly pick up the competition level of what is going to take place in training camp
7712768 ini pelajaran seorang politisi dituntut untuk tidak melakukan kekerasan dalam bentuk apa pun apalagi terhadap bawahannya yang mesti dilindungi
7712769 im a hillary clinton democrat and i support john mccain
7712770 it seems there are people who want to destroy me and my family
7712771 they say i live on a dollar a month but this is all lies by people who dont want my brother to win
7712772 what the 501 c 3 non profit corporation save senator obama kogelo school inc proposes to do is to fulfill the senators promise and to preserve the honor of kenyan luos and of americans
7712773 in 2006 senator obama visited a small school in his fathers home village and pledged to support a school they named the school in his honor as their most famous son since then americans have raised over 5 000 for the school
7712774 no matter what some people in the media may want you to think
7712775 reggae is and always has been a music of love
7712776 for some people reggae music might just be reggae music
7712777 then you have a whole movement of people who just dont think that way so you want to make that handful of guys erase what bob marley peter tosh the skatalites and everyone else did over the last fifty years
7712778 we lived right across from the prison my mother was a single parent
7712779 like i have to do this when i was eighteen we moved to brooklyn we were in flatbush which has a big west indian community there were a lot of influences that you might not want to be a part of guns and drugs before long most of my friends were either killed or in jail i wanted to do something better
7712780 i dont understand the segregation and categorization of music nobody can pigeonhole me
7712781 my next door neighbours are the prime minster and courtney walsh
7712782 there are in fact many acts in the country clearly advocating discrimination against tuberculosis and leprosy patients a leprosy patient cannot stand for local body or panchayat elections in states like chhattisgarh rajasthan madhya pradesh andhra pradesh and orissa this prohibition extends to tuberculosis patients in orissas panchayati raj act further if a member of local office contracts tuberculosis or leprosy during his her tenure he she may be declared ineligible for the job in andhra pradesh and karnataka the hearing impaired and mute also cannot stand for panchayat elections
7712783 there is a special section on two leading gujarati women of fiji other chapters deal with gujarati contribution in law politics education business and sports one chapter is a case study of the rise of a gujarati family it is the story of the parshotam family
7712784 the second part deals with personal histories and biographies the family history of the narseys is dealt with extensively
7712785 from hawkers to million dollar duty free shops from small grocery stores to giant supermarkets from a small retail store to a conglomerate of industries from a tailors shop to a giant garment manufacturing concern young men and women with basic education to doctors lawyers and accountants the journey of gujaratis in the fiji islands spans a 100 years of growth
7712786 but who knows i might just do that when the time comes
7712787 but i have no intention of stepping down from my position anytime soon
7712788 we dont know the situation ourselves theres a lot more questions than there are answers
7712789 god puts me through hell so i could make it to heaven
7712790 you gotta admit from a scale from 1 to awsome im dah sh t
7712791 austin wants to make sure that if he gets into the ring its not just to capitalize on his name he wants to be the best performer on the show if he cant live up to that he wont do a match if he can be the old stone cold then youll see him wrestle at wrestlemania xxv
7712792 you gotta admit from a scale from 1 to awsome im dah sh t
7712793 dont like pizza donate your money to end pizza faces everywhere
7712794 all i can do is appeal to anybody who was in coogee bay road that night if they saw those two people or anybody else near david if they could please get in touch with police
7712795 they were identified by people were also able to locate some of davids property along the route these two males we believe took
7712796 they have no idea theyve done what they can its up to david now to try and wake up
7712797 we miss david he was always smiling we have a picture board above the bed and in every photograph he is smiling whether he can smile again we dont know
7712798 why did i even buy this game it sucks only old people would get it
7712799 yo no lograba imaginar la aparici n repentina de una c lula fotosint tica a partir de di xido de carbono nitr geno y agua escribi oparin por eso llegu a la conclusi n de que primero debieron haber surgido mediante un proceso no biol gico las sustancias org nicas de las cuales se formaron m s adelante los primeros seres vivos organismos que al principio eran heter trofos y se alimentaban de las sustancias org nicas del ambiente
7712800 uno de los rbitros simplemente no lo crey y retard la publicaci n del art culo declar miller tiempo despu s luego se disculp conmigo fue bastante raro que aunque urey avalaba el trabajo se hiciera dif cil publicarlo si yo hubiera enviado el art culo a science por mi propia cuenta el original todav a estar a en el fondo de un mont n pero el experimento era tan f cil de reproducir que no pas mucho tiempo antes de que fuera convalidado
7712801 en mi opini n respondi el dr miller el problema m s importante en los estudios acerca del origen de la vida es la naturaleza del primer material gen tico el origen de la vida es el origen de la evoluci n y para eso se requiere replicaci n adem s se necesita que ese proceso de replicaci n se valga de sustancias prebi ticas
7712802 pienso que es bastante probable que el proceso que ocurri en la tierra primitiva pueda ser reproducido en el laboratorio respondi a futuro el dr miller no me animo a especular cu nto falta para eso
7712803 la formaci n de una c lula viva a partir de una sopa qu mica inanimada es tan probable como el ensamblado de un 747 por un torbellino que pasa a trav s de un dep sito de chatarra
7712804 were expecting these lobbying organizations to try to evade the rules
7712805 recording the performance conducting on the record interviews and taking photos for publication without permission is strictly prohibited inside the venue
7712806 if house members try to use that guidance to justify parties were just going to go to the public and explain what the actual rules are and make the case thats a violation
7712807 purpose spirit meaning and language of this important new ethics rule by not participating in any lobbyist financed party at the coming national conventions that in any way honors you
7712808 we will keep an eye out as to whether people are breaking the rules
7712809 and we will be exposing even those parties going on within the rules
7712810 that flies in the face of just about every other number ive seen in this race and i think mason dixon had a bad night
7712811 this poll is so far off the mark i cant even respond to it
7712812 everyone has internal damnation waiting to rear and wreak its vindictive and sadistic means
7712813 if there is no peace then it is because weve forgotten that we belong to each other
7712814 lo que est haciendo hacienda es seguir el comportamiento del portafolio para ver que se tomen las medidas adecuadas y que esto no lleve a un problema mayor y es por eso que estamos tranquilos
7712815 lo que est haciendo hacienda es seguir el comportamiento del portafolio de cr dito para ver que se tomen las medidas adecuadas por parte de los intermediarios y que esto no lleve a un problema mayor y es por eso que estamos tranquilos ya que tenemos la informaci n
7712816 vemos con buenos ojos que el crecimiento de la cartera total al consumo ha bajado respecto a lo que se ve a en meses anteriores y que los bancos est n tomando acciones preventivas y para tratar de reestructurar la cartera por lo que creemos que es un fen meno que se est controlando y manejado de manera razonable
7712817 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
7712818 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
7712819 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
7712820 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7712821 and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
7712822 i have come here tonight to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7712823 as i look ahead i am strengthened by family and friendship
7712824 so many of you have been with me in the happiest days and the hardest days
7712825 together we have known success and seen failure victory and defeat
7712826 for me this is a season of hope new hope and this is the cause of my life new hope that we will break the old gridlock
7712827 has been a senator for all who believe that the dream has never died
7712828 two men who have changed my life and the life of this country
7712829 but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most this is one of those moments
7712830 be forced to provide services that violate their own conscience
7712831 she wasnt paid for over half the medical services she provided
7712832 this was where my people were and this was where i wanted to fulfill my mission
7712833 in a time when almost no one was doing house calls she was loading up the van and taking care of people
7712834 no midas tu riqueza por el dinero que tienes mide tu riqueza por aquellas cosas que no cambiar as por dinero
7712835 los antecedentes relativos a los procesos o condenas de menores de edad s lo podr n ser consignados en los certificados que se emitan para ingresar a las fuerzas armadas carabineros de chile gendarmer a de chile y a la polic a de investigaciones o para los fines establecidos en el inciso primero del presente art culo
7712836 the theory behind the design was to try to bring the american people into the process
7712837 but its an interesting question whether dazzling is what the obama campaign needs right now
7712838 these poll numbers show that both walberg and knollenberg could lose in november
7712839 to keep their seats they have to make their challengers the issue and attack on such issues as taxes and energy
7712840 they both have compelling bios so why does peters gain so much i think age is one thing that may have some impact knollenberg is four years older than john mccain
7712841 when you get into the 70s that influences folks but it would have be dealt with delicately
7712842 i felt he grabbed me but it was overlooked by the refs
7712843 thats football and you have to deal with it i have to be in better position so it doesnt happen
7712844 hes a respected receiver if its not called thats a plus in his books but of course i want it called
7712845 just as the big boost to infrastructure ive announced today reflects last years strong economic performance the economic challenges were facing this year mean i can safely predict i wont make this kind of announcement 12 months from now
7712846 through the citys 2009 budget process this contribution will allow us to invest in transit city and other city building initiatives that matter to torontonians and that help make the city clean green livable and prosperous
7712847 we have a significant five year plan in capital and a 10 year outlook with some major projects in it
7712848 because there are projects that just simply have to be done we have a lot of debt built in to the plan this allows us to manage it a little better
7712849 our best advice is not to add a whole bunch of things on to a wish list but to use this in a very prudent and responsible way we have significant projects coming in the way of transit infrastructure and such but not all of that funding was completely secured
7712850 in the 10 year outlook there are a number of projects that are in pending sources of funding so now we can nail that down a little
7712851 this is the cause of my life new hope that we will break the old gridlock and guarantee that every american north south east west young old will have decent quality health care as a fundamental right
7712852 yes thats pretty much what i was thinking thank you bitter show for letting me know myself better
7712853 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7712854 an open time limit is not acceptable in any security deal that governs the presence of the international forces
7712855 go through a number of levers in the iraqi political system before we actually have an agreement from the iraqi side
7712856 until we have a deal we dont have a deal
7712857 we will not accept to put the lives of our sons on the line by guaranteeing absolute immunity for anybody whether iraqis or foreigners
7712858 without the approval of the iraqi government and american forces
7712859 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
7712860 i welcome the growing convergence around this pragmatic and responsible position
7712861 whenever you win wars your troops come home and our troops will be coming home but it will be dictated by the conditions on the ground and the success or the lack of success
7712862 to get kicked out of heaven without your wings and halo
7712863 whoa this is heaven cuz it looks like a club to me but hey maybe we get to party harty in heaven
7712864 then why are you here because you should be in heaven playing a harp and eating bagels
7712865 whatever you did you should make amends and then maybe god will let you back in heaven
7712866 i can help you im good with the helping thing did you have evil thoughts let someone get killed
7712867 how bad of an offense does it have to be to get an angel kicked out of heaven
7712868 i told you i could get him to yell in five minutes
7712869 leo i cant believe you would yell at our nineteen year old babysitter
7712870 hello i grew up on the hellmouth you really think i wouldnt have caught on by now ive known for a while and do you really think i would believe those types of stereotypes i just wanted to ruffle your feathers sides you know proud spikes going to be when he finds out that i made an angel yell he might even cry
7712871 come on wyatt and chris lets go home and build forts while mommy and daddy make you a new brother or sister to play with
7712872 were going to make forts and eat tons of ice cream
7712873 then well jump on beds run with scissors and take candy from strangers
7712874 you know all the cool stuff that your parents never let you do
7712875 are you sure we should trust her with the boys
7712876 shes my charge and all but chris went through a lot of trouble to keep wyatt from going evil i dont think we should be risking that by letting dawn anywhere near them
7712877 no one is the same you cant compare yourself to other people because everyone is different
7712878 i said that in the media to put some context around it
7712879 i was asked a question would it have been leaked from my department and i said no because it was actually written in my office so clearly it was leaked not from my department
7712880 one of the most successful police ministers this state has had for decades
7712881 there is somebody obviously who has access to that letter who thinks its pretty scintillating
7712882 im not sure who it was and frankly i dont care much because our government believes in getting on with the job
7712883 a real estate agent might describe it as having some rustic charm
7712884 now we have completely taken over nbt and i want more people to join them
7712885 i dont think we need to keep this at the extreme end of where it is at the moment i think we should be able to wind that back somewhat before 2010
7712886 it should be wound back and if corporate australia doesnt think that then maybe we should apply it to corporate australia as well
7712887 we made an election commitment that we would get rid of it in january 2010 and thats exactly what we are going to do
7712888 thats what people expect thats what we are going to do
7712889 a lot of us are uncomfortable about this policy but it was a rudd labor commitment and kevin rudd confirmed that yesterday that its a promise he will be keeping
7712890 i dont think that impacts from the opportunity to explore what could be done in still respecting that promise
7712891 i think its fair to say there is a great deal of concern within the caucus
7712892 once you know that know it for sure you can do things go places you never thought about before everything there is gives you some place to go something to think about everything take a a brass rivet say its brass you start with that and what is brass an alloy how much change of what metal would make it not be brass given enough time would radioactive decay in one of the metals transmute it enough so it wouldnt be brass any more or take the size how big is it well doesnt that depend its smaller after its been used than when it was new what color is it that depends too in other words if youre going to describe to me exactly what that rivet is youre going to have to qualify and modify and get up a list of specs half as long as a tide chart and half as wide as bowditch and then all i have to do is sweat one drop of sweat on that rivet and wait twenty four hours and youll have to revise your specs
7712893 listen quiche if you whine at me one more time im putting you up
7712894 this is a first in bib brother no one has ever made a deal gotten two people protected on a hoh before
7712895 and i own him i have all the power he has to do everything i say this is a first no one ever got to pick one of the nominees too
7712896 i got two things and hes gotta give em to me he cant put up michelle and i get to pick a nominee im getting those two things
7712897 the short version of the story is they didnt want to quit their partying
7712898 if you put this in the class of wedding receptions gone bad i guess this would take the cake
7712899 when you win in three sets it is a good results
7712900 i had some difficult moments in the match so that is going to help me be prepared for the pressure moments later on
7712901 i was trying to stay focussed as well as i could
7712902 its a matter of how fresh i can stay for this tournament
7712903 i want to get some rest and make sure i dont practise as much as i did in beijing i need to save some energy for this tournament
7712904 i tried to keep my level up i tried to hurry him
7712905 he was hitting his forehand really hard and making me do a bit of running
7712906 it was a decent test and i came through it pretty well
7712907 there have been some great performances from a lot of players this year but we dont have anything like justine who was able to win every single tournament
7712908 in the first set i felt like i was playing against a wall
7712909 in the second set i told myself to just play your game and dont give up
7712910 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7712911 nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight theres a new wave of change all around us and if we set our compass true we will reach our destination not merely victory for our party but renewal for our nation
7712912 we are concerned by indiscriminate weapons fire by sudanese government forces on the kalma internally displaced persons camp in south darfur sudan
7712913 attacks on vulnerable populations in sudan are deplorable and violate international law
7712914 the united nations urges restraint and calls for the immediate establishment of a humanitarian corridor so that the injured may be evacuated
7712915 severely threaten the safety and security of civilians who have a right to protection under international humanitarian law
7712916 the government forces still surround the camp there is no fighting now but tension is high throughout the camp
7712917 this morning security forces surrounded kalma camp and demanded that every idp internally displaced person leave
7712918 later they opened fire on the eastern side of the camp we have 27 confirmed dead including five women and two children
7712919 government forces killed 25 idps this happened before the eyes of the hybrid force i urge the international community to protect idps
7712920 shortly after we got calls from sheikhs who said those officers had already positioned themselves in the camp and that shots were fired
7712921 our people are inside kalma we are taking a leading role in coordinating organising a convoy of the wounded negotiating with the government and working to ensure a positive outcome to this crisis
7712922 we are in contact with all the parties to find a lasting solution
7712923 its our legal right to do this if there ever was a good reason to have a recall i think this pretty much is it
7712924 i have done nothing to warrant my resignation and do not believe that would be in the best interest of the city at this time
7712925 although the feds and the state investigators are looking into it it may be years before they can clean them out
7712926 were not going to wait anymore were going to go and do what we can now
7712927 all that the leader of the opposition has done is undertake the kentucky fried chicken kfc marketing overhaul of queensland politics
7712928 a couple of years ago kentucky fried chicken knew that people were no longer interested in eating fried chicken their tastes were changing and so they sat around the marketing table and said lets change our name from kentucky fried chicken to kfc and maybe no one will notice that what were selling is oily greasy chicken
7712929 the leader of the opposition has gone out there and said well no one really wants to vote for the liberal and national party any more so ive got a great idea were not going to call it the liberal national party were going to call it the lnp and no one will notice that its the same group of people with the same old ideas the same greasy good old boys
7712930 we estimate that about 550 staff across australia and new zealand will lose their jobs
7712931 about a third will be editorial and about two thirds will be other parts of the company not specified
7712932 its one of the most significant job losses in australia this year and its obviously going to have a serious impact on the ongoing quality of the companys papers magazines and websites in australia and new zealand
7712933 ive never had anyone inspire me the way people tell me my father inspired them until now barack obama inspires me that way
7712934 it was really cute he was sitting with his daughter and rubbing her back he seems like a really nice guy
7712935 we will provide a government supported place for every eligible student who wants to train retrain or boost their qualifications in victorias training sector
7712936 this will not only be a major win for students but will make it easier for mothers wanting to return to work workers seeking to increase their skills and victorians wanting to train in growth industries
7712937 as food fuel and rents soar pensioners particularly full single age pensioners can barely keep their heads above water

7713040 ferrari and kimi joined forces in 2007 kimi won his first world championship in his first season with ferrari a completely different environment that he was used to it wasnt easy at all granted mclaren and hamiltons mishaps helped last season but it works both ways this season kimis mishaps are helping hamilton and ultimately massa as the teams world champion their no 1 kimi has the right to be given equal equipment above all equal treatment the equipment being the car the developments the determination of his mechanics to help it cant be the same as what massa is receiving because theyre both very different drivers one asks for something else the other likewise the team give them that inside kimis camp i assume theres a difficulty in understanding and therefore giving kimi has been more uncomfortable than content with his machine in the time spent at ferrari yet he won the title beating massa last year and was only 5 points behind hamilton in the championship now up until his engine blew up this is by no means a disgrace its still not bad but by kimis potential and ability he might as well be put in some sort of fia prison because he can give so much more

7713050 im here to pay tribute to two men who have changed my life and the life of this country barack obama and edward m kennedy
7713051 their stories are different but they share a commitment to timeless american ideals

7713064 europe should try to take steps to ease russias withdrawal from the security zones which are a real sticking point for moscow
7713065 russia doesnt want to retreat from areas in georgia proper that can serve as a staging area for the georgian military so thinking about how to make the sarkozy plan stick anything the european union can do to separate the forces and create a cordon sanitaire for diplomacy to proceed would be a step forward
7713066 the eu always has trouble speaking with a single voice
7713067 it will find consensus all the more difficult in this crisis in central europe theres a sense that we told you so russia is again an aggressor state and in western europe there is a much more complicated view of the war in georgia and an unwillingness to jump to the conclusion that its time to man the barricades and contain russia

7713072 from societys perspective covering the uninsured is still a good investment failure to act in the near term will only make it more expensive to cover the uninsured in the future while adding to the amount of lost productivity from not insuring all americans

7713088 an agreement has not been signed and so from our perspective there is no agreement until theres an agreement signed
7713089 but any decisions on troops will be based on the conditions on the ground in iraq that has always been our position it continues to be our position
7713090 weve been opposed to arbitrary dates on the calendar especially when things were tough from a security standpoint
7713091 as conditions improve it certainly enables us to have the discussion about goals going forward and where we hope iraqi security forces will be

7713299 this information has been made available only recently by gujarat to the central government
7713300 simi has been active throughout the nation and extensive evidence has been filed 151 affidavits and a large number of witnesses 77 have been examined by the centre in support of its contention that the entire purpose and activities of the simi are illegal and unlawful and that they resort to violence in the name of jihad
7713301 the intelligence bureau had also sent various inputs which clearly indicated that members of simi continued with their activities and had managed to keep its network alive clandestinely
7713302 simi has revived the organisation through front organisations clandestine meetings and circulation of leaflets posters and magazines
7713303 simi continues to exist and its activities are being carried on
7713304 certainly there is a manifest increase in heinous offences and incidents even between 2006 08
7713305 for all your loyal readers who practice yoga of which i feel safe to assume there are a few a great yoga apparel store is opening across from whole foods on p street

7713307 you see that house over there for sale im writing down the address so i can look it up when i go home
7713308 oh thats a great house you should check it out go knock on the door
7713309 media companies fit for the modern media world need to be lean and agile
7713310 this far reaching program will position us well for the next stage of our growth and development
7713311 this initiative has been carefully constructed by the publishers with full regard for the integrity of their mastheads our newspapers will remain true to their heritage and their values of quality and excellence
7713312 she won california and people are scared to wear hillary buttons
7713313 if barack obama is my second choice i think they should be happy with that and not try to beat me down
7713314 real no matter how much you try and deny it
7713315 a lot of supporters of hillary are not totally convinced
7713316 my view is that hillary stood for our community time and time again and i will stand for her i will follow sen clintons lead
7713317 our nomination is decided to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive were talking about the nominee for the president of the united states to lead our country into the future thats what this convention is about
7713318 look i get sad anytime a woman is not successful
7713319 so lets not spoil it and let it stand in the way of what we must do in terms of public policy to give these women and all americans the opportunity they need
7713320 has yet to close the deal with many white working class voters who normally vote democratic
7713321 weve got a very short time to get this campaign together
7713322 but im not comfortable with all her supporters i think a good number of them will defect
7713323 i understand this process and what has to happen emotionally with people after they experience loss and anger
7713324 i also know at end of the day everyone has to unify women especially
7713325 i dont believe we can tolerate a john mccain as president who is going to appoint supreme court justices that are going to erode roe v wade and a womans right to privacy thats the bottom line for me and a lot of women
7713326 i know hes going to win by making sure every vote is cast and every vote is counted
7713327 this is going to be a grassroots campaign like it was in the primaries we have a lot of work to do its not going to be easy
7713328 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7713329 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7713330 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7713331 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7713332 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7713333 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7713334 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7713335 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7713336 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7713337 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7713338 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7713339 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7713340 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7713341 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7713342 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up
7713343 i am concerned that there are people who are still attempting to find strategems to avoid compliance with federal law
7713344 city officials have been directed by the mayor to refer all undocumented felons to immigration regardless of age
7713345 better himself and his situation through the foster care system
7713346 to circumvent the intentions of the mayor as it relates to undocumented minors involved in illegal drug sales
7713347 if this minor returns to the community i am very concerned that he will run from a non secure environment
7713348 further our office is not in a position to effectively provide supervision services to an undocumented person without the risk of violating federal law
7713349 remorseful for his actions and has a desire to better himself and his situation through the foster care system his ambitions are strong indications that the public will not suffer further transgressions of the law
7713350 like any child within our jurisdiction without a parent or guardian he deserves the opportunity to go into foster care
7713351 this is a methamphetamine and firearms case that arose from a traffic stop made by an aurora police officer
7713352 firearms and methamphetamine were seized and a number of individuals are in state custody the matter continues to be under investigation well provide more information as it becomes available
7713353 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7713354 we have become a nation of struggling folks who are barely making it every day
7713355 folks are just jammed up and its gotten worse over my lifetime and doggone it im young forty four
7713356 no i guess i couldnt afford a 400k house on my 40k a year job
7713357 i am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy
7713358 and i am afraid that she is a coquette for she is always flirting with the wind
7713359 but i love travelling and my wife consequently should love travelling also
7713360 it is a fine position with plenty of fresh air
7713361 there is not a single cloud in the sky the stars are quite clear and bright and yet it is raining the climate in the north of europe is really dreadful the reed used to like the rain but that was merely her selfishness
7713362 what is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off
7713363 i did not know what tears were for i lived in the palace of sans souci where sorrow is not allowed to enter in the daytime i played with my companions in the garden and in the evening i led the dance in the great hall round the garden ran a very lofty wall but i never cared to ask what lay beyond it everything about me was so beautiful my courtiers called me the happy prince and happy indeed i was if pleasure be happiness so i lived and so i died and now that i am dead they have set me up here so high that i can see all the ugliness and all the misery of my city and though my heart is made of lead yet i cannot chose but weep
7713364 far away in a little street there is a poor house one of the windows is open and through it i can see a woman seated at a table her face is thin and worn and she has coarse red hands all pricked by the needle for she is a seamstress she is embroidering passion flowers on a satin gown for the loveliest of the queens maids of honour to wear at the next court ball in a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying ill he has a fever and is asking for oranges his mother has nothing to give him but river water so he is crying swallow swallow little swallow will you not bring her the ruby out of my sword hilt my feet are fastened to this pedestal and i cannot move

7713392 trinity has given well over 100 000 in support of its partnership with us and in 15 months of regular meetings with jeremiah wright we always found him to be a man of gracious hospitality humor generosity who paid attention to detail but also a man who does not call attention to himself
7713393 when youre euro american blog editor pc for white the people at trinity ucc are so exceedingly gracious warm and welcoming
7713394 the scope of their concern and outreach is extraordinary its really just an outstanding congregation
7713395 they firmly believe in the uccs commitment to an educated seminary trained clergy

7713414 there was a time when faulkner university had some severe financial problems i am convinced that if it had not been for faulkners concern for the school and his generous spirit there might not be a faulkner university today it is only fitting that the school should bear his name
7713415 education should be of high quality but if it is not convenient and accessible to the students it isnt of much value
7713416 as is often the case i get too interested and too active
7713417 in my mind i was sure they did not want auburn or troy university or the university of south alabama to have a law school
7713418 i thought that perhaps the university would not mind a private christian oriented school owning it
7713419 some church members thought the law school had no business being at a christian university
7713420 i would hate to walk around town and be worth fifteen million or twenty million and couldnt think of anybody that i had helped or any good that i had done ive never wished for money for the purpose of living luxuriously ive always wanted to have money to give away thats what i enjoy
7713421 1 but how do they get that way in the first place
7713422 the fact that barack obama chose to launch his political career at the home of an unrepentant terrorist raises more questions about senator obamas judgment than any tv ad ever could
7713423 this convention provides a very important opportunity for the obama campaign to bond with the constituencies that supported hillary clinton
7713424 its not about barack or hillary its about bringing in the people here who voted for hillary rodham clinton senator obama and senator biden are without question qualified to do that
7713425 there are people who may not want to stay but i am not in that category

7713430 really the safest thing you can do is make all your food at home from scratch period
7713431 sometimes we buy the product anyway and sometimes we dont
7713432 what does this really mean can i count on it as a consumer to really have any meaning

7713436 there were few athletes and lots of people in the delegation of gabon
7713437 unfortunately they did poorly during the competition and even the president denounced that there were many people in the delegation and not many athletes
7713438 i think most of the people think they went there only to do shopping
7713439 they have bought a lot of things and they went there only for shopping that is why there were a lot of officials in the delegation
7713440 as food fuel and rents soar pensioners particularly full single age pensioners can barely keep their heads above water
7713441 after a lifetime of contributing to the growth of this nation what sort of retirement is that for our most vulnerable australians
7713442 what it will mean is that theres a recognition of each countrys regulatory framework in so far as securities trading is concerned he told abc radio from washington
7713443 practically that will mean that australian brokers and the asx australian stock exchange can direct trade on securities in the us and visa versa
7713444 so it cuts out whats known as a chaperoning arrangement it cuts out red tape compliance and reduces cost for australians and reduces costs for us investors
7713445 i just got clarification on that yes you can he said
7713446 if a brokerage firm or the asx have operations online you can do it through that format
7713447 i think there might be interest in both countries because it does reduce compliance costs and red tape and there are savings involved for operating through the mutual agreement he said
7713448 very importantly this is the first time that the united states has recognised any other countrys jurisdiction in the world we are the first
7713449 they have recognised that australia does have a reliable regulatory framework in securities trading such that the us will recognise australias robustness and regulatory oversight
7713450 therell be more liquidity therell be more flow i think broadly will be the improvement and therell be a reduce compliance and red tape cost in investment and thats got to be a good thing he said

7713467 were in a highly competitive market one in which many consumers are shifting what were formerly discretionary dollars toward the purchase of necessities its more important than ever for restaurant operators to understand what their consumers are looking for in the dining experience and tailor their offering to it
7713468 to do that operators and suppliers must have information that lets them get into the heads of the consumer both by generational segment and psychographic cluster
7713469 the word twat was used in context it was meant to be a nasty word on purpose because this is a nasty character

7713485 many middle class americans do not receive the existing mortgage interest tax deduction because they dont care to learn how they can receive it so to make sure that those irresponsible americans essentially get this free money were going to create another gigantic government bureaucracy that will cost you more in taxes thats right you get your mortgage deduction and you follow the rules but we need you to pay more in taxes to pay for a program to help people who do not follow the rules sucks to be you

7713500 it is clear that more research is necessary to pinpoint the reasons for this cluster including whether environmental contaminants are a factor
7713501 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7713502 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads

7713555 ive never seen anyone execute a golf ball so consistently
7713556 i dont look much like barack obama and we grew up in different places but im here tonight because ive met barack and he understands what people like my wife and i are going through
7713557 it was like talking with family it became clear that they are regular people
7713558 barack and michelle grew up dealing with the same challenges most of us face they were raised by working folks and its pretty clear that he can relate to working people and those who are struggling
7713559 obama tells you what we need to hear like john mccains gas tax proposal isnt the answer barack obama has been willing to speak the truth that it is just designed to win elections not fix our problems
7713560 barack obama is the only person i trust to do the right thing for all of us thats why im here tonight and thats why hes my choice for president
7713561 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7713562 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7713563 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black

7713567 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right

7713570 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7713571 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7713572 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7713573 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7713574 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7713575 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7713576 god puts me through hell so i could make it to heaven

7713591 the initiative deceptively reads like its supporting all alternative fuel vehicles and renewable energy sources
7713592 but a closer read finds a laundry list of cash grabs much of the measures billions could benefit pickens company to the exclusion of almost all other clean vehicle fuels and technology
7713593 even worse private trucking and delivery companies could buy 5 000 natural gas trucks collect california taxpayer funded rebates of 200 million or more and immediately send those fleets out of state
7713594 its like asking california voters to finance a new bridge with taxpayer dollars without mentioning that the bridge could be in ohio

7713599 the topic du jour is fannie and freddie clearly the market is looking for a solution that is permanent clear and definitive that dwarfs everything
7713600 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7713601 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7713602 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7713603 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7713604 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7713605 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7713606 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7713607 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7713608 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7713609 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7713610 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7713611 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7713612 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7713613 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7713614 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7713615 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up
7713616 such arbitrary bombing raids and brutal killings have been repeated so many times during the past nearly seven years that now it is difficult to believe these foreign forces have come to our country for assistance
7713617 state and local law enforcement officers to not arrest individuals or seize marijuana under federal law
7713618 and yet the problem is one rarely gets a true
7713619 a very idealistic thomas jefferson prayer that nobody would understand
7713620 what i would pray if there were no microphones or cameras
7713621 you can deny the trinity and get less anger than if you support a democrat

7713625 my dad had rolled over to rest and had just stopped breathing
7713626 the respondents motion is denied because it is legally deficient the court first notes that the motion was timely filed on november 2 2007 well within ninety days of the courts october 16 2007 decision however the motion is legally deficient because it did not include an affidavit from the respondent s as required by 8 c f r 1003 23 because the motion fails to comply with regulatory requirements it must be denied

7713633 the evidence is clear barack obama was born in the u s a
7713634 driving the entire race is much more arduous than it appears
7713635 its grueling enough when things are going well but when things go wrong it becomes even more difficult to stay focused i could not have finished this race without the team hummer support crew
7713636 i do not see any improvement in these issues for at least a year
7713637 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7713638 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7713639 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7713640 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
7713641 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower
7713642 there are a lot of beginners this is not a high powered league this is a developmental league whose main purpose is to promote the sport
7713643 i have never seen behavior of a parent like the behavior jerichos mother exhibited wednesday night

7713647 ive seen it and i think its a good thing people able to express themselves in they way of how they feel and everything
7713648 unfortunately its going to cost us to clean it up but on the other hand do we want to look at it all the time no
7713649 see in my line of work you got to keep repeating things over and over and over again for the truth to sink in to kind of catapult the propaganda

7713683 what it will mean is that theres a recognition of each countrys regulatory framework in so far as securities trading is concerned he told abc radio from washington
7713684 practically that will mean that australian brokers and the asx australian stock exchange can direct trade on securities in the us and visa versa
7713685 so it cuts out whats known as a chaperoning arrangement it cuts out red tape compliance and reduces cost for australians and reduces costs for us investors
7713686 i just got clarification on that yes you can he said
7713687 if a brokerage firm or the asx have operations online you can do it through that format
7713688 i think there might be interest in both countries because it does reduce compliance costs and red tape and there are savings involved for operating through the mutual agreement he said
7713689 very importantly this is the first time that the united states has recognised any other countrys jurisdiction in the world we are the first
7713690 they have recognised that australia does have a reliable regulatory framework in securities trading such that the us will recognise australias robustness and regulatory oversight
7713691 therell be more liquidity therell be more flow i think broadly will be the improvement and therell be a reduce compliance and red tape cost in investment and thats got to be a good thing he said
7713692 were certainly interested in as many mutual arrangements as we can obtain senator sherry said when asked if china was next on his hit list

7713699 when i became governor i had to raise 2 4 billion in taxes
7713700 when re election came around people arent stupid one incumbent lost and she voted against the tax increase
7713701 this is the time we have to challenge the american people folks you get what you pay for
7713702 its hard for anybody to say that a specific amount of exposure to any of the things on the market is going to benefit them many years down the line
7713703 but theres no downside to being mentally active nobody thinks brain games are going to do anyone harm

7713731 along with our partners in nhs 24 and nhs boards across scotland we have sought out new ways of helping people who experience anxiety and depression
7713732 this funding will deliver accessible user friendly cognitive behavioural therapy and put people more in control of their mental health
7713733 the scottish government is committed to improving services for those with anxiety and depression and this funding is a direct expression of that commitment
7713734 we will also be commissioning a full evaluation of this pilot service to determine whether this can be rolled nationally in the future
7713735 around 300 000 people each year in scotland seek help from their gp for symptoms of depression making it the most common mental health condition experienced by people living north of the border
7713736 while medication is frequently prescribed there is a broad awareness that psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy can provide long term benefits to patients
7713737 developments within this type of therapy have shown that computerised or telephony based cbt can be highly effective as part of a wider model of care for those with mild to moderate depression

7713765 forget tom daschles blog the south dakota politics blog is where you want to go if youre interested in well south dakota politics and hey who isnt
7713766 bloggers like south dakota politics have done a great job of exposing the incredibly biased reporting of the states dominant newspaper the sioux falls argus leader
7713767 first the nyt now the sioux falls argus leader bloggers subject their state paper to close scrutiny
7713768 the influence of blogging on politics is nowhere more obvious than in south dakota
7713769 a credible counterweight to local south dakota papers such as the sioux falls argus leader which too often falls into the habit of ignoring new angles to the race and uncritically running mr daschles press releases

7713821 something is happening but you dont know what it is do you mr jones
7713822 theme music and incidental music for dramas and documentaries and soaps plus md ing with barry on series like the live mike which featured the late and greatly missed dermot morgan he was a quite a bunch of characters to work with one of his regular personae was a manic priest fr trendy who foreshadowed fr ted that whole period was a great training ground in terms of learning the craft
7713823 if you mean what triggered my whole spiritual journey it was being born on planet earth of course
7713824 and what creed might that be i have none i personally believe we are truly one in our deepest truth that there is one life in creation and all our adventurings and learnings are leading us to that realization this is the perennial wisdom and it has been around as long as god
7713825 guru with all its distortions would be the last word eileen caddy would use to describe herself she is a teacher certainly primarily by the example of her own life shes an ordinary woman who has lived in an extraordinary way following the inner guidance of the still small voice within the voice of god within wherever it leads however strange its instructions might appear to human values her whole teaching is to turn others inward to find that inner divine source within themselves the mark of the true spiritual teacher and that is what ive learned from her i love her a whole lot and am very grateful for the privilege of knowing her
7713826 i dont reject christianity it is the religion of my race and like everyone else here i grew up with the stories of the example and teaching of jesus and how could i be untouched by that but i am not a practising christian im not even sure jesus would be if he incarnated today as for cs lewis yes he was a committed christian but i find if a writer or teacher is infused by the true divine spirit as lewis undoubtedly was this is magnified and transmitted through their work regardless of the name of their faith iona is well known as a christian centre because of the work of st columba who brought christrianity there in the 6th century but it was a druid centre of power before then and the island has a spiritual quality or soul that is divinely and powerfully itself and accessible to all who have eyes to see regardless of their spiritual background or religion lastly the christ to me is the divine energy that jesus manifested on the physical earth hence his bearing the name jesus christ but i believe the christ energy existed before jesus and is a universal energy infusing every part of creation and every human being whether they call themselves christian or not
7713827 i generally make em wherever i find myself but on occasion i have made a decision in advance to for example write and record in the west of ireland late 80s or to record the new universal hall album in findhorn in the spiritually charged atmosphere of the findhorn community i am always inspired by the places i live and by what i feel and see around me and this inevitably flows into the music and the albums
7713828 whether i could have been a megastar is unknown as cs lewis liked to say we are never told what might have happened nor am i interested in what might have happened ive always followed my heart guts and fascinations and i have learned to surrender to the places both physical and inspirational to which they take me yes the songs and creativity are more important than any riches that could result but i have nothing against houses in malibu malibu is a very fine place indeed
7713829 steve and i are great friends and even when we werent working professionally together we were always in touch in 1999 steve invited me to sligo where he lives in the west of ireland to do a show so i went over and we did a two man concert together it was a great success and i knew we had a lot of music still to make together then i asked him to guest with us at our shows in dublin and belfast in 2000 it went so well i asked him to rejoin the band and to my great pleasure and delight he is back and playing the greatest rock fiddling ever
7713830 steve gives the music wings a sense of the elemental a sweetness a gateway to the unseen
7713831 yes indeed peace of iona was a hypnotic chant until steves fiddle entered the picture and turned it into a sonic evocation of the island and the elements
7713832 well i cant answer that for him though we had a great time together in findhorn making universal hall he has visited many times
7713833 im familiar with taize chants because they are very popular in findhorn and i also work with affirmations so im used to the idea that a few short lines of words carefully chosen and repeated aloud or inwardly can have a powerful inspirational effect when my songs started coming in this minimal form with only 2 or 3 lines the challenge was to allow them to be so and not to be tempted to flesh them out into a normal structure i resisted the temptation
7713834 it is finally hitting a store near you in ireland on may 16th the tracklist is revelate star star god bless mom pavement tune stars are underground lay me down rent day blues what happens when the heart just stops perfect opening line santa maria fitzcarraldo your face and the blood weve left the bit in in the middle of fitcarraldo where the amp blew up and caught fire and a story about a dog part from that its full on music crowd music crowd music etc from start to finish and is a very nice addition to ones collection 0 the version of your face is particularly fine i think 3mv in england will be making the record available in stores in the uk from the 26th may little big in australia will be making the record available in stores as soon as humanly possible too now in america i dont know yet what were doing with the record hopefully it will be available in stores too at some point soon or on amazon sooner but im sure well bring over a suitcase to sell at the shows in june for those that cant wait i beleive that konkurrent in the benelux countries will be taking some set lists too to get out in their territories
7713835 we dont have to go to church to talk to god
7713836 jesus healed the blind it may mean that he gave the unsee ers back their faith therefore restoring the vision therefore healing the blind and if you apply this method of thinking to every aspect of the bible and its miracle stories then it becomes much easier to believe he really was as powerful as the book describes because these surely were miracles real miracles
7713837 there is a profound prophetic nature to your work you are bringing together the integration of the head the heart and the hand in the tradition of celtic spirituality and you are in the line of the bards in the powerful way that you can transform society
7713838 paul and i met on a recording session and knowing his track record as a songwriter i nervously handed him some demos on the second day he must have taken pity on me or decided i wasnt a total write off because we later fixed up a writing day together and it worked out really well
7713839 the thought behind the song is finding something unchanging in all the changes
7713840 ideally id want people to put the kettle on and take another listen
7713841 we met at greenbelt on the rising and i approached him we met in london for a writing day
7713842 he brought a mature simplicity to the songs id sent him i think i was busy busy busy with lyrics he seemed to just bring in a purer version of what i was trying to do
7713843 well ive thought about it often i do think music that is written out of our being can be prophetic i think it can communicate god in a way that nothing else can i just think its kind of embarrassing and big headed to go around focusing on it so i try not to think about it for fear of loosing any gift that god has potentially given me in thinking im some kind of big important prophet
7713844 on a totally different note tdk looked to get to 530m up until last weekend but this weekend it took
7713845 when i referred chinks in jays methodology it was regarding arriving at nett number
7713846 100 today might mean less today than they would over time
7713847 pesonally i do not believe that it ill happen to succesful and or educated muslims
7713848 may be no one wants to sell her a house because the messenger is a leftist dharna waiting to
7713849 so does the spiritual depth of your lyrics come from going to mass or smoking pot in front of the tv
7713850 youve got to earn my vote youre not just going to get it by default because of your party and if i vote for you i will be keeping tabs on you
7713851 defends the now fairly conventional liberal reform position that consent ought to be the demarcation between rape and non criminal sex responding to both radical feminist and modern queer theoretic arguments that problematize it
7713852 shepherd of the songs pushing them where they want to go
7713853 we want to change the world but that is not an arrogant statement that we are more important than people who do not put guitars around their necks
7713854 and there is probably always some part of the melody or idea worth salvaging and even if there isnt you can just forget it and go off and surf
7713855 i write from and for myself and play the songs for myself and god and my wife they have to cross a boundary before the band get to hear or influence them
7713856 well we decided the where when and how of this album we had a great idea of what we wanted columbia did not come in until after the album was done
7713857 pascal says something about the total depravity of man sitting along side the beauty of the human condition this album is about that mix and hope i believe for hope to be truly hope it has to reach deeper than the wound we can take away the pain but hope for me has to go deeper and deal with the cause of the pain
7713858 i cant see harry reid helping president bush clear brush at the ranch and then knocking down lemonade together
7713859 i know what you mean my new wife and i have a three year old
7713860 couples what word comes to mind when you hear about a seventy year old man having babies
7713861 thats right couple number three it is awesome to have babies at seventy you won a cheap washer and dryer to wash those nasty diapers in once you join me in parenthood
7713862 on the right landon really it was a closet that we used as my room the house only had one bedroom and my mom and dad had that
7713863 one day at long last i stumbled out of the woods of my own and my families and my countrys past holding in my hands these truths that love grows from the rich loam of forgiveness that mongrels make good dogs and the presence of god exists in the roundness of things this much so far i have figured out i know this much is true

7713883 son does it look like fun when your mom and dad drive

7713891 i have never had someone inspire me the way people tell me my father inspired them but i do now
7713892 and i know someone else whos been inspired all over again by senator obama
7713893 a senator for all who believe in a dream thats never died
7713894 im sure dr king is looking down on us here in denver noting that this is the first political convention in history to take place within sight of his mountaintop
7713895 at times history and fate meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning point in mans unending search for freedom
7713896 im sure dr king is looking down on us here in denver noting that this is the first political convention in history to take place within sight of his mountaintop

7713902 oh my friend needs to use my phone to call her boyfriend
7713903 to learn to succeed you must first learn to fail
7713904 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect

7713908 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect
7713909 everyone has internal damnation waiting to rear and wreak its vindictive and sadistic means
7713910 there were more entertainers in there than at any event ive ever attended
7713911 in short the longer the election protest cases remain unsolved and the longer the cases drag on our day to day operations will remain affected thus hampering delivery of basic services to our people
7713912 its good thing that mayor ramon calo opted to remain silent on the issue stayed cool and did not insisted to hold office inside municipal hall after supporters urged him to also seat as mayor after the comelecs first division issued resolution that he is still the duly elected mayor of carmen
7713913 be that as it may may we seek authoritative guidance from that division as to whether or not the assumption of mr ramon calo is in the accordance of comelec rules and procedures
7713914 in terms of the front end journalist area there might be some job losses but the main thrust is in the sub editing
7713915 its one of the most significant job losses in australia this year and its obviously going to have a serious impact on the ongoing quality of the companys papers magazines and websites in australia and new zealand
7713916 media companies fit for the modern media world need to be lean and agile mr kirk said
7713917 this far reaching program will position us well for the next stage of our growth and development
7713918 over the course of the 2006 and 2007 financial years we achieved 52 million in ongoing real cost reductions he said
7713919 cost synergies associated with the merger of fairfax media and rural press and the acquisition of southern cross radio produced a further 53 million in savings
7713920 all of these synergies will be realised by the end of this financial year
7713921 with the new organisation structure in place and line management operating effectively now is the time to launch a third wave of business improvement which will deliver benefits over the next two years
7713922 medicare payment error rate said to be much higher than reported
7713923 the unsightliness of it to start with you can imagine trash piles 70 80 feet
7713924 all the old buildings asbestos dust and trash they dont take out of their building they dont go in a remove all of that they put them in one stack
7713925 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
7713926 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
7713927 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7713928 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7713929 the outlying towns and cities of puerto rico like cayey are no longer sheltered from drug trafficking gangs and violent crime
7713930 the theory behind the design was to try to bring the american people into the process
7713931 but its an interesting question whether dazzling is what the obama campaign needs right now
7713932 i think he could go your way with just a little urging
7713933 lets call him right now whats his cell phone number
7713934 hey ron your wife told me you might vote for me but i need to do a little work to show i have plans for small businesses
7713935 and then you have the antacid following right up there
7713936 could i just mention to you jay that in a moment of seriousness i spent five and a half years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair
7713937 i spent those five and half years not because i wanted to get a house when i got back home
7713938 hes a guy who barely got out of high school fought in world war ii in the army came home and made a business and made the american dream
7713939 we spend our time in a condominium in washington a condominium in phoenix some time over here in the state of california and then we have a place up in northern arizona
7713940 and my friends im proud of my record of service to this country and it has nothing to do with houses
7713941 the white house was saved by the action of one brave soldier john mccain
7713942 i know youve been asking about who i want to be my running mate
7713943 wouldnt it be good to have a person you dont know what party theyre with they have no political principles whatsoever they may need a job about that time
7713944 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7713945 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7713946 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7713947 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7713948 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7713949 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7713950 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7713951 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7713952 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7713953 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7713954 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7713955 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7713956 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7713957 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7713958 sen hillary clinton can perform the attacking functions of the vp nominee as well as biden
7713959 will the democratic party which is committed to say the least to gender equity and which in fact has a 50 percent quota for female delegates accept obamas imposition of a glass ceiling at its convention
7713960 it would be crazy for the democratic party to follow an establishment thats led it to defeat year after year
7713961 white women are a problem thats you know we all live with that
7713962 barack obamas been out here in areas ravaged by hurricane katrina to reach out to people and he has deep awareness of whats going on in the gulf region his deep religious faith and his background as someone whos come from nowhere you might say to a high position in the political world all of that i think bodes well for america i dont have any doubt that when we have a democrat back in the white house this january barack obama he will make sure this never happens again
7713963 i just dont think hes got yet the proven substance or experience to be the president
7713964 god willing we will perform well we will manage against all odds unless there is massive rigging any independent observer will concede we have an edge
7713965 capable of bringing change that will benefit the people regardless of race
7713966 i think its a test of who protects the malay interests the most to which party will they entrust the political future
7713967 i come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7713968 together we have known success and seen setbacks victory and defeat but we have never lost our belief that we are all called to build a better country and a newer world and i pledge to you that i will be there on the floor of the united states senate when we begin
7713969 a season of hope new hope for a justice and prosperity for a justice and prosperity for the many not just the few
7713970 decent quality health care as a fundamental right and not a privilege
7713971 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans
7713972 not merely victory for our party but renewal for our nation
7713973 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7713974 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7713975 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7713976 the vice president will be delivering the word of americas support
7713977 that sends the message to the kremlin that it risks international isolation
7713978 mr cheney is widely viewed by the russian political elite as the toughest hawk on russia in the bush administration
7713979 it hasnt gone unanswered in fact id say its been loudly answered
7713980 i dont think theres any question that russias reputation has suffered since it took these disproportionate military steps in georgia
7713981 theres no question that russia hasnt lived up to the cease fire agreement

7713988 under state law we had to run 50 days of live racing before we opened the card room on june 30
7713989 we had losses that were not unanticipated from harness racing without the card room we had better than expected attendance but it was an educational process for people to learn about betting the take from the racing was less than expected minnesotans are conservative
7713990 now we are operating the card room its been well received were still working on marketing to expand awareness were just getting off the ground next year it will be great to have harness racing and the card room at the same time
7713991 we anticipated the losses at running aces which were primarily due to pre opening expenses including hiring and training more than 500 employees and the cost of completing the first live race meet before we were permitted to open the card room
7713992 i think people across the country are revisiting what they need in a vehicle

7714000 i wanted to be a ballet dancer but they said pingpong was right for me
7714001 the sports systems of the united states and china are very accurate metaphors for our societies china is a society run by engineers based on planning and coordination and central planning
7714002 the state is the supreme entity and the role of the individual is to support the state
7714003 truth be told this old soviet system works if you are going to scan the whole population of 1 3 billion for a certain body type and then throw vast resources into training them you will produce champions

7714015 google looks as if its on top of the world right now holding an ever increasing lions share of the search market the way it treats its employees writes preston gralla another example google employees such as sergey solyanik have started deserting the company and its share price is down double that of the dow or nasdaq since november 2007 even if google has lost its mojo why should you care it wont make your searches any less effective will it nope but google has its eyes on bigger things than search notably your it department its looking to displace microsoft with hosted services like google apps gmail and google docs solyanik warns that googles engineers care more about the coolness of a service than about the services effectiveness

7714031 the mvp award was an honor and just to see the company im in from winning it is great but it hasnt put any pressure on me that i feel i put the pressure on myself
7714032 if theyre double teaming me somebody else is going to be getting to the quarterback
7714033 our depth on the d line is going to be a lot better and thats going to allow us to play fast
7714034 you have some guys who havent been hollered at their whole career so they took offense to it
7714035 in your face hes going to let you know if youre not working hard it can be toward the end of practice and maybe youre tired and want to get some water if youre not running hell let you know about it
7714036 all of them to be honest with you its good though and its going to be great for our team
7714037 although the population of bears has grown from a low of about 12 000 in the late 1960s to approximately 25 000 today our scientists advise me that computer modeling projects a significant population decline by the year 2050
7714038 the early estimates of polar bear abundance are a guess there is no data at all for the 1950 60s nothing but guesses we are sure the populations were being negatively affected by excess harvest e g aircraft hunting ship hunting self killing guns traps and no harvest limits the harvest levels were huge and growing the resulting low numbers of bears were due only to excess harvest but again it was simply a guess as to the number of bears
7714039 merely by summarising the various national counts which still must be considered inaccurate one reaches the conclusion that the worlds total polar bear population is probably closer to 20 000 animals than to the lower figures often suggested
7714040 its a shame that youre not hiring an outside investment banker to put the company up for sale and frankly that you and the board feel that you still have a right to shepherd the company forward

7714042 and if not and you dont know what youre doing with the business then how can you justify keeping on operating and burning cash
7714043 but it kills me because i still believe we had all the right things going for us we had all the smart ideas i dont know how we screwed it up so well
7714044 i aint happy with holding all the stock i do when its under 3 bucks a share and all im dealing with the hopes and promises and a brighter future
7714045 i want the future now if we cant do it then lets sell the company
7714046 i feel compelled to say that im very very sorry as a founder and someone that had the idea and concept to see a company that went to 800 million in revenue and then to see where were at today i can only imagine emotionally how you feel
7714047 but it happens in situations where you have two ceo dismissals in a year and the stock is trading at its cash value

7714113 shouldnt have an impact on a womans right to choose
7714114 over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7714115 abortion always deliberately kills an innocent unborn child nobody can honestly claim to be a faithful catholic and then support a false right to abortion its just an elegant way of evading the brutality of what abortion actually does
7714116 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception from the first moment of his existence a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life
7714117 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
7714118 the inalienable rights of the person must be recognized and respected by civil society and the political authority these human rights depend neither on single individuals nor on parents nor do they represent a concession made by society and the state they belong to human nature and are inherent in the person by virtue of the creative act from which the person took his origin among such fundamental rights one should mention in this regard every human beings right to life and physical integrity from the moment of conception until death

7714130 the great recession game of 08 what inning are we in
7714131 we will probably see the market about where it is for a period of time and probably see a rebound sometime in 2009
7714132 hard to avoid the conclusion that sales have bottomed out
7714133 inventories are very high relative to sales rates and would probably be even more so if all those wishing to sell their home actually had the house on the market instead of pulling it off in the face of weak demand and eroding prices
7714134 there is still a considerable distance to travel before prices sink to levels necessary to balance supply and demand in the housing market

7714144 there are too many people in office who have really rendered themselves ineffective and need to go we need new blood and new leadership
7714145 we do not have a written bilingualism policy in our schools we operate on a per needs basis with individual schools
7714146 but we are not federally funded if we were then legally we would be bound to have a bilingual policy
7714147 if you want to stay on the streets then keep talking that way but if you want a job you must learn to speak the kings english
7714148 instead of worrying about whether immigrants can learn to speak english theyll learn you need to make sure your child speaks spanish you need to make sure your child becomes bilingual

7714266 cuts of essential items such as food and medication should be of immediate concern to seniors families
7714267 other reductions in spending can lead to less obvious issues one of the biggest problems that we see is senior isolation which has been magnified during this troubled time in our economy with the high price of gas
7714268 when seniors families live a distance from their loved ones or when boomer children are busy trying to make ends meet themselves an older adult can get in trouble very quickly thats why its so important that someone look out for the well being of seniors to ensure they are safe in their homes and eating properly taking their medications and able to maintain their appointments and social life
7714269 falling interest rates fixed incomes and seniors fears of past hardships can influence how they react to the current economic slowdown
7714270 some seniors may be running short on money but for others theres always that fear of running out because they lived through the depression they know how ugly it can get
7714271 seniors want to get the best that they can from their investments without falling for scams or overselling tactics
7714272 seniors at all income levels may be facing choices they havent had to make in the past
7714273 they should know where to go for help before they put themselves or their health at risk area agencies on aging for instance offers both food and gas assistance so seniors should contact their local offices if they cant make ends meet and companies such as home instead senior care can provide transportation assistance and help around the home and serve as a second set of eyes for seniors families
7714274 he was loved by his parents and was well liked we would just prefer not to be talking about him in past tense and wish he was still with us
7714275 codeine itself doesnt have any pain relieving effects but our body changes it into morphine and thats what combats the pain
7714276 the problem is that your genetic makeup makes more or less of it
7714277 so this is where the risk lies because you cant know in advance what that predisposition would be unless you would do a genetic test which is not standard routine at this point so while it would not be a problem in all cases i would say that codeine cannot be considered a safe drug for some mothers who are breast feeding their infants
7714278 the savings they will get doing away with lunch in business class they will lose more than that when corporations yank business the challenging thing about business is that whether things are good or bad you have to invest in your product for the sake of keeping customers and to make it harder for competitors to catch up with you this does nothing to encourage people to pay more because you give more they really make me question whether the inmates have taken control of the asylum
7714279 there is no doubt anymore about that foreign partener lufthansa is in pole position to conclude an alliance
7714280 i hate to jump on this bandwagon but katie holmes has been lookin so good everywhere i see her
7714281 it is every womans inalienable right to have a pulled together stylish confident wardrobe with money left over to live
7714282 ive never liked to overload the roster in september too much
7714283 you kind of base it on what you think makes the best sense
7714284 does the bible teach that god extends grace to all men but men can resist that grace
7714285 you may freely eat of every tree of the garden but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat for in the day that you eat of it you shall die
7714286 none is righteous no not one no one understands no one seeks for god all have turned aside together they have gone wrong no one does good not even one
7714287 grace is an attribute of god one of the divine perfections it is gods free sovereign undeserved favor or love to man in his state of sin and guilt which manifests itself in the forgiveness of sin and deliverance from its penalty it is connected with the mercy of god as distinguished from his justice this is redemptive grace in the most fundamental sense of the word it is the ultimate cause of gods elective purpose of the sinners justification and of his spiritual renewal and the prolific source of all spiritual and eternal blessings
7714288 well then god has granted to the gentiles also the repentance that leads to life
7714289 im very fond of abhishek whatever happened between ash and me is over im really fond of the bachchans abhishek is a buddy and i really like him i wont have anyone speak badly about his wife
7714290 classical music took a wrong turn in the period after the death of vaughan williams
7714291 the ruination of music as part of mainstream culture came largely because of subsidy composers stopped writing for their public and wrote instead for the small clique that was responsible for commissioning pieces
7714292 the leading young english composer is thomas ad s whose opera powder her face won rave reviews in 1995 and has since been repeatedly performed around the world he has been commissioned by the likes of the royal opera house and the berlin philharmonic and has produced pieces that have won instant audience acclaim ad s may be english but unlike vaughan williams there is almost nothing in his music to show that vaughan williams may no longer be the last to write serious music for general audiences but as a recognisably english composer he was indeed the last of his kind
7714293 im terrified an ant will crawl into my babys crib and bite him
7714294 i have to literally run from the car to the house to avoid being bit
7714295 i would have never bought my house had i known i wasnt going to be able to use the yard
7714296 these ants love humid weather until we have five really cold winters in a row it looks like they are here to stay
7714297 i knew these ants were different than regular ants the first time i saw them they move very fast and bite my dog cant go outside and come back in without being covered in them regular ants dont do that
7714298 the other day i was pushing my granddaughter on the swing in the backyard when i felt this sting on the back of my leg i looked down and dozens of brownish red ants were marching up my bare leg
7714299 were just at a loss as to how to get rid of them
7714300 we had a conversation at our last budget meeting that we werent going to participate in prdc so i wonder why theres a question on that one when there was no question on participating in the tourist association or anywhere else
7714301 they would be quite sick with that level of symptoms theyd be in need of an urgent medical assessment
7714302 the risk to the pregnant women is not really a risk to them but to their unborn child
7714303 most people who ate the products wouldnt get sick if theyre otherwise healthy or just mildly sick
7714304 if youre still not sure were recommending you be safe and throw the food out anyway
7714305 pre made meat sandwiches should have been recalled already through the manufacturer if they contained the affected meat but if youre not sure in the next few days id say buy something else to eat
7714306 its an unbelievable feeling to win a gold medal for your country
7714307 i cant begin to describe to you the feeling that we all feel right now its unbelievable
7714308 we became one ego a team ego and that growth was a beautiful thing to see
7714309 it was at a point where we were about to pull away and something happens that we couldnt pull away
7714310 it was a real test to see what were all about
7714311 i think the one thing weve done is weve gotten better every week since weve started
7714312 like i tell the kids the best thing about it is that all of the stuff that needs fixed is fixable
7714313 its not a case of we dont have guys here or there we have little things that need fixed weve still got to work on some blocking and fine tuning we definitely have gotten better every week
7714314 we made some halftime adjustments and i thought our line and our running backs did a good job adjusting
7714315 the biggest thing is we made a commitment to running the ball but we also made a commitment that our main thing from a coaching standpoint was our kids being able to adjust on the run that ultimately can win or lose games can your kids adjust to what theyre seeing on the field and can they do something that maybe they didnt practice that week but you have to do because of whatever youre getting from the team buchtel decided to bring seven guys sometimes even eight into the box and we had to adjust a little bit
7714316 its understanding that on fourth and 18 they throw the ball down the field knock it down instead of intercepting it
7714317 just little things like down and distance just the little fine points you have to get your kids to understand i want them to focus because in the heat of the moment you need to be at your best
7714318 this is where i think i can have the biggest impact
7714319 when i interviewed for this position i equated the kids to the shells on the beach
7714320 each one is beautiful and each one is special but they dont look anything alike some of them wash up on the beach and they are broken but thats ok they are still beautiful
7714321 they are so full of innocence bright eyed and they are excited about learning
7714322 i really dont think its fair that i would get something special in my lunch and they didnt
7714323 ive got grapes a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and oreos
7714324 i liked that we made mistakes in the first half and we didnt make them in the second half
7714325 we came in at halftime and were able to correct whatever we did wrong in the first half our kids also i felt learned to step it up and overcome adversity
7714326 we were struggling in the first half with containing orrvilles quarterback and struggling with field position things like that we really learned how to step up in the second half and we also picked up a little bit of a killer instinct during that time when the door opened we went into it we went way into it actually
7714327 i liked that we didnt turn the ball over at all
7714328 we were very careful with the football two of the biggest things that we focus on are that we have no turnovers and no penalties in each game we didnt turn it over and we only had five penalties our kids managed the game very well
7714329 jones and shaw both played well at quarterback we were very efficient passing the ball and our offensive line just took over when it came time to run the ball in the fourth quarter
7714330 a lot of that has to do with our offensive line and some excellent downfield blocks by our receivers guys like brandon wilson evan bach and jon semelsberger
7714331 we got a real good game out of marcus strickroth klatt denny ardman jordan pellikan michael law and tim caillet that enabled us to control the football in the second half
7714332 the big thing is that guys who were playing good have stepped it up even better guys like denny ardman who was just excellent on the offensive line last week
7714333 stories that rely not only on the journal s matchless access to captains of industry but a long waning commitment to nuance and humor and the seemingly superfluous but telling detail and um length would get better play in a lifestyle magazine format
7714334 we have removed the single greatest barrier to increased communication between our members
7714335 im not sure if theyll get all of their stickers but theres a good possibility theyll have something on their helmet
7714336 my theory behind it was i want these guys to respect and understand where theyre at and the program theyre actually playing for
7714337 sometimes you have to earn that stuff i want them to take pride in earning some of the things they get as we grow theyll get more and more on the helmets as a team its kind of a team builder as well
7714338 i let them know that great facilities dont correlate to a great team
7714339 you have to work hard you have to put time in you have to be focused and committed to being successful and you have to be a team player
7714340 we talk about those little things all the time to them
7714341 we talk about dont take for granted where youre at dont take for granted the tradition of the program youre in i think our kids are real receptive and understand where theyre at
7714342 youre glad to get it out of the way from the standpoint that we had a lot of kids playing on friday night for the first time
7714343 and it being my first night at massillon its nice just to get that out of the way and get into the heat of this schedule and just concentrate on football you dont have much time to think about it but were definitely im happy to get that over
7714344 theres a good chance well have brandon pedro back with us this week were excited
7714345 congressman blank of texas why are you afraid to talk to the press
7714346 okay what is your name how do you spell that the company you work for is and the name of your supervisor is how do you spell that
7714347 fine can i speak to the person above the security who made this decision i think they actually want me to attend
7714348 i dont understand why you are embarrassed to let credentialed press in
7714349 why wont you give the list to me are you embarrassed should congressmen be embarrassed for attending is something illegal going on if you dont have anything to hide why is everyone coming in afraid to talk to the press
7714350 its coming along a little slower than i wanted it to but i think eventually i started to pick things up and play like i want to play and like i know that i can
7714351 of course there are some similarities but i try to come in with an open mind and learn what the coaches expect here out of this system and leave new york behind
7714352 neither one of them are as easy as you would think but thats part of the game its part of being an adaptable type player which i feel i am it comes with the territory
7714353 he is a veteran that has been in a system similar to this from a terminology standpoint he works hard hes tough and has made some plays for us in the kicking game he has made some plays for us defensively particularly in the running game he is strong and can take people on i think he has had a solid camp and has made the transition well i dont think it has been a problem for him
7714354 he played inside in college and played inside at the jets when herm edwards was the head coach they played a 4 3 and he played off the line and played inside the tackles he didnt really go to the outside and play on the line of scrimmage until the last two years it is a little different now than what it was but i dont think it is dramatically different than what he has done earlier in his career at the jets or at michigan
7714355 i just look at it like if i get a great opportunity to play or if i get just one or two plays just make sure that on those one or two plays or those 30 or 40 plays i do something thats noticeable that i show what im capable of doing
7714356 you can get caught up in going out there and trying to do more than you need to be doing i think coach belichick does a good job of structuring everything so that you just do your job and everything else will fall into place
7714357 one thing ive learned is you cant worry about the business side of it all i can control is when i look in the mirror did i get better did i contribute to the team ive tried to do that each and every day and take that approach and let the business side take care of itself
7714358 ach we hoeven maar 1 nachtje over zee en dan zijn we al in het kielerkanaal
7714359 we kunnen gaan motoren of alsnog naar hooksiel want dat kunnen we wel zeilend halen
7714360 i cant remember the last time i employed someone from them
7714361 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7714362 for all those whose cares have been our concern the work goes on the cause endures the hope still lives and the dream shall never die
7714363 too bad i strained my shoulder of id totally whup you
7714364 but in pop warner you really dont kick too many extra points or field goals
7714365 you might be back in a couple of years to take a look at mcnamara
7714366 it was a tim wakefield knuckleball but it went through
7714367 you cant rattle him i usually stay away from kickers theyre weirdos but hes got a good sense of humor i like him he works hard in the weight room he thinks hes a linebacker hell throw a block hes not some wimpy little kicker
7714368 i looked at a couple of colleges i knew i wanted to kick i took a tour of bentley and liked it
7714369 i was really excited i was glad all the hard work paid off
7714370 its possible itll take a lot of hard work and lifting
7714371 i like pressure situations a lot why take the easy way out i like the game being in my hands
7714372 sorry the keyword does not match up with any services offered by csw
7714373 dont go full retard sean penn went full retard in i am sam and no oscar never go full retard
7714374 it was the wrong decision and i think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that theres no doubt in my mind i would have made those saves and the fact of the matter is its not 2004 anymore its not 2004 and its 2007 and i think you have to live in the present and you cant live by big names you cant live in the past it doesnt matter what somebody did in an olympic gold medal game in the olympics three years ago now is what matters and thats what i think
7714375 fair trade means that haitians and others around the world can have a better life have a better vision of themselves can stand on their own two feet
7714376 biden is very well aware that his sons deployment is going to be a big part of what we do in october its part of our narrative and were going to milk it for all its worth
7714377 hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital ten years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror
7714378 but the obamas marriage and family life are the most traditional of any presidential candidate edwards a finalist to be obamas running mate may be considered pelosi made the first extended argument against electing john mccain during her speech to the convention earlier today
7714379 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
7714380 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
7714381 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
7714382 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
7714383 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
7714384 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
7714385 how do i center a fixed width layout using css
7714386 need to go 3 52 then 3 52 3 then higher
7714387 if i dont volunteer i will destroy the school pushing it and all our children and the dedicated teachers and staff over the precipice to their doom
7714388 we are attracted to attractive people so if a writer is attractive you can be sure well see a huge professional head shot on the dust cover
7714389 like an athlete who must be able to withstand the physical challenges of his sport and still thrive you must be an athlete in the game of life daily lifes physical challenges may be less dramatic but the cumulative effects can lead to chronic pain and decreased levels of performance sitting standing carrying a heavy bag driving and working at a computer day after day take a major toll on the body exercising and working your core regularly will improve how you function and minimize long term wear and tear on your body helping you to thrive it will improve your performance in life and in your favorite recreational activities it will also give you a great body pp 9 10
7714390 her hands kept reaching up to make sure the hair extensions were still there
7714391 your r sum says you live in new york and went to school in the east but it doesnt say where you grew up
7714392 youd be amazed i interview all these college grads from the east and midwest highly accomplished young people making major life decisions with tons of variables to consider and weigh and what do they want to talk about the weather it always comes down to the weather with them theyre not here for a job theyre only here for sunny days amazing
7714393 you think its hot outside let me tell you you dont know hot until youve spent a summer back east dont even get me started on the bugs
7714394 you think its cold outside let me tell you you dont know cold until youve spent an autumn back east dont even get me started on the winters
7714395 thats the beauty of an earthquake it might be bad but only for a minute back east the cold grey days of winter never seem to end and theres the mud season to look forward to now thats a natural disaster
7714396 its not healthy for a 10 year old to be sitting around the house all day
7714397 were you at the pit last night did you see that guy break the pitcher while trying to break dance on the bar the one whod lost his pants well later we saw him on the sidewalk passed out in a pool of his own vomit who was he i dont remember his name but you know hes the californian
7714398 allowing us to find if only for a moment the meaning that eludes us outside the pages where were just one of billions
7714399 rigid one size fits all pedagogical model its fetishistic reliance on objective but meaningless facts and figures its sports addled pep rally style of conditioned social conformity and its artificial and other directed pavlovian system of grade based rewards
7714400 you frittered it all away you never went to class but it wasnt a waste of money you have a college degree the world is your oyster
7714401 get enough people together and you can trust their opinion
7714402 7 000 of you have rung in to say youre disgusted with mugabe well have more on that later
7714403 how long until someone mentions that obama biden looks like osama bin laden and how long until they try to use it against them probably not long
7714404 i think shes the reincarnation of grandma or joe my dad
7714405 maybe shed be granny but joe was too evolved to come back as a cat
7714406 concerned about someone googling someones name and being able to access it later
7714407 it will have to be taken into account this is a very interesting development from the point of view of our project
7714408 a point that needs making is that judge harvey is no mug when it comes to the internet he has written a text book on cyber law in new zealand
7714409 on a technical level he probably knows more about the internet than any other judge in the country
7714410 do you want what youre doing today online to be permanently documented and accessible to anyone in the years to come
7714411 online content is public information and is fair game for employers to ask about it
7714412 dont tell me that it a negative comment online wouldnt have an enormous impact on your emotional and professional well being
7714413 now who can tell me what this device is called

7714420 thus far j t s been better than the other two smith and shaun hill and there hasnt really been much of a gray area his plays been better at the position than what weve had at any point in the last three years
7714421 i could answer for him but i know what i said and i know what i was thinking nolan said

7714432 theres a lot of love in my heart i cant wait to see the speaker when he gets here
7714433 i think the convention is rightfully focused on the nominee and his or her vice presidential candidate
7714434 my view of the convention is it should be all about barack obama and joe biden
7714435 those of us who really genuinely want to see senator obama elected president should be eager and happy to stay out of the limelight and take a seat in the back row get up and applaud and more than that go out and speak on behalf of the ticket knock on doors if necessary and then do the things in government that sen obama stands for like fundamental ethics reform
7714436 are you saying that here its a scheduling issue pure and simple
7714437 if i just do this quietly then the publics not going to know that we have a chance to ban double dipping we have a chance to ban this phony pay raising system
7714438 i think its proper that hes not here hes no help to the ticket
7714439 mir y que pens oh dios mio se parece a jes s en la cruz
7714440 im bobbing and weaving and every now and then i get caught bam right hook i like to equate it to boxing but were still in the fight still in the fight were still in a good spot
7714441 high interest rates hit consumer confidence first and the stark evidence is in the latest retail trade figures which show a substantial decline of 0 6 per cent in the june quarter
7714442 when you combine high interest rates with other factors like rising petrol prices consumer confidence is hit hard and discretionary spending by families is wiped out
7714443 the reserve bank has accomplished its job inflation needed to be tackled but the job is now done and its time to relent and offer families some relief
7714444 my daughter did this to me because i hurt the mother
7714445 i have to pray five times a day for what i have done
7714446 as food fuel and rents soar pensioners particularly full single age pensioners can barely keep their heads above water
7714447 after a lifetime of contributing to the growth of this nation what sort of retirement is that for our most vulnerable australians
7714448 as food fuel and rents soar pensioners particularly full single age pensioners can barely keep their heads above water
7714449 rashids sister picked it up and accidentally pulled the trigger his sister is a very active child it all happened so quickly it was a terrible accident and we are hoping and praying he recovers he is my life
7714450 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight he told more than 4000 cheering delegates
7714451 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future and to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7714452 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight amp squo amp squo he told more than 4000 cheering delegates
7714453 what it will mean is that theres a recognition of each countrys regulatory framework in so far as securities trading is concerned he told abc radio from washington
7714454 practically that will mean that australian brokers and the asx australian stock exchange can direct trade on securities in the us and visa versa
7714455 so it cuts out whats known as a chaperoning arrangement it cuts out red tape compliance and reduces cost for australians and reduces costs for us investors
7714456 i just got clarification on that yes you can he said
7714457 if a brokerage firm or the asx have operations online you can do it through that format
7714458 i think there might be interest in both countries because it does reduce compliance costs and red tape and there are savings involved for operating through the mutual agreement he said
7714459 very importantly this is the first time that the united states has recognised any other countrys jurisdiction in the world we are the first
7714460 they have recognised that australia does have a reliable regulatory framework in securities trading such that the us will recognise australias robustness and regulatory oversight
7714461 therell be more liquidity therell be more flow i think broadly will be the improvement and therell be a reduce compliance and red tape cost in investment and thats got to be a good thing he said
7714462 were certainly interested in as many mutual arrangements as we can obtain senator sherry said when asked if china was next on his hit list
7714463 caminaba con mis hijos en la isla escocesa de arran en agosto del 2008 y fui completamente sorprendido cuando claramente vi el cuerpo de un extraterrestre en los bancos a la orilla de la corriente mis hijos y yo est bamos tan asustados que r pidamente corrimos lo m s que pudimos lo puede creer
7714464 i would not dignify this tokenism by organising anything there it will have to be at a proper place like here at raffles place or down a major street or nothing
7714465 generally if there are no issues of concern there wont be any overt police presence there all the time and we will manage it just like other places in singapore
7714466 if we were to plant more trees you actually have less space so theres a trade off
7714467 es mejor que l haya hackeado y encontrado una falla que una organizaci n terrorista
7714468 tratando de cubrir su verg enza de tener mala seguridad
7714469 es sorprendente c mo muchas personas piensan que est bien que este nerd haya hackeado las computadoras
7714470 supongo que tambi n piensan que los virus y el spam son pasatiempos inofensivos claramente sus partidarios no tienen computadoras o cerebros
7714471 no tengo tiempo para gary mckinnon y pienso que sus actividades eran despreciables y que merecen el castigo pero no en un tribunal de eu
7714472 estados unidos no permitir a que sus ciudadanos fueran juzgados fuera de los eu por la misma raz n no debemos dejar que ellos juzguen ciudadanos brit nicos en sus tribunales
7714473 si se hubiera cometido un delito se cometi en los eu independientemente del lugar donde mckinnon estaba sentado en ese momento
7714474 este hombre est en efecto acusado de cometer delitos en estados unidos 97 de ellos en realidad los delitos que se cometen por v a electr nica son delitos independientemente de la ubicaci n de la persona que los cometa
7714475 but ive been using them for years ever since you kids were born i cant believe youve only just tried them now
7714476 its unbelievable like the guys said there was absolutely no way we were going to win sure enough we came back and we battled back and bases loaded with no outs we just believed in ourselves and stayed hard
7714477 i was like a little kid 5 years old again run around there like it was christmas it was unbelievable just to see my kids faces and to know what they just accomplished
7714478 im glad it paid off in practice running foul balls in 105 degree weather practicing it all paid off
7714479 i was a nervous wreck that whole time that final game our boys came from behind every single time and we got up by 6 runs in my gut i was like dont start celebrating yet
7714480 its starting to sink in now its an unbelievable feeling
7714481 our bourgeois not content with having wives and daughters of their proletarians at their disposal not to speak of common prostitutes take the greatest pleasure in seducing each others wives
7714482 private housekeeping is transformed into a social industry the care and education of the children become a public matter society takes care of all children equally irrespective of whether they are born in wedlock or not
7714483 thus the anxiety about the consequences which is today the most important social factor both moral and economic that hinders a girl from giving herself freely to the man she loves disappears
7714484 the problem of free love always comes to the fore
7714485 a matter of revolutionary progress liberation from old bonds of tradition for others an eagerly accepted teaching conveniently covering every sort of free and easy relation between man and woman
7714486 of the 11 deaths in ontario six have been characterized as where the listeria bacteria has been an underlying or contributing factor in the death
7714487 five are still under investigation in terms of determining the extent of the contribution of the bacteria to the death of the individuals
7714488 the one in b c is still a little bit controversial but listeriosis contributed to the death
7714489 all the suspect cases have been diagnosed with listeriosis but it is only via laboratory testing the genetic fingerprinting that we can determine if they are directly linked
7714490 that would be an investigation by the public health agency of canada and the local health units they do the food history so they would make the linkages
7714491 in terms of prevention their advice to pregnant women is lousy
7714492 maybe they should put a warning label on the back of the package
7714493 we trust these people to provide food and they send stuff out and you get all these recalls
7714494 you never know these days what youre going to eat if its really sanitized
7714495 this is an example of where our surveillance system worked
7714496 we dont think any organisms belong in the amniotic sac
7714497 really the safest thing you can do is make all your food at home from scratch period
7714498 sometimes we buy the product anyway and sometimes we dont
7714499 what does this really mean can i count on it as a consumer to really have any meaning
7714500 advisory labelling may not be protecting the health of allergic consumers
7714501 not suitable for consumption by persons with an allergy to x
7714502 he escuchado cr ticas viscerales de las que no estoy de acuerdo l ser un padre maravilloso eso es lo realmente importante
7714503 okay okay i admit it im in love with him happy now
7714504 mer and the colonel sitting in a tree k i s s
7714505 youre still a bit of a butterball arent you meredith
7714506 being attracted to men as well as women at least widens the field but why dont you ever fall for someone you can actually have mer
7714507 he does have that entire he cant possibly be gay thing going on doesnt he
7714508 not really i cant imagine him restricting all that to half the human race alone
7714509 gay straight or bi you wouldnt have much of a shot with him either way mer
7714510 come on mer you always fall for someone who wouldnt give you the time of day
7714511 that shows what you dont know about my sex life
7714512 come on mer you dont really think youd have a chance at all at colonel sheppard
7714513 what makes you think we havent been sleeping together for months
7714514 that does bring pictures to mind mer that id really rather not think about
7714515 listen you cant say a word about this to sheppard or anyone else and for gods sake dont say anything to aunt marge
7714516 sheppard is american military they have that entire dont ask dont tell thing it could cost him his career just keep quiet about it okay dont mention it to him he wouldnt like that i said anything
7714517 really meredith the mckay men all have blood pressure problems and you
7714518 so i understand you and i have been fucking like rabbits for months
7714519 yes what else do you think involved means now will you let me up
7714520 okay youve got it im sorry i insinuated that youre gay you couldnt possibly be gay could you kirk happy now
7714521 she said that whether youre gay straight or bi you could have anyone you wanted and you wouldnt want me not even if we were the last two people on earth
7714522 youre my best friend mckay she doesnt have a very high opinion of me to think id just use you for sex
7714523 or are you just waiting until we get back to atlantis so you can have ronon kill me so he can dispose of the body
7714524 ronon thinks weve been having sex ever since hes known us
7714525 he says you must be pretty good in bed or i would have let someone shoot you by now
7714526 or maybe youd rather i have stayed out of it if you and ronon might have
7714527 oh come on mckay youre into guys you cant tell me you havent had a fantasy or two where ronons concerned a big good looking guy like that
7714528 kirk sheppard charmer of men and women both throughout two galaxies
7714529 so is the rest of what your sister told me true
7714530 water running and another door closed between us and the rest of the house
7714531 i havent either ive only topped ive never known anyone i would want to let fuck me
7714532 so you ah know i was lying yesterday about me and sheppard im sorry okay im a terrible liar you know but you kind of pushed me into it saying sheppard wouldnt have me and whatnot
7714533 aunt marge heard you you know you and john having sex
7714534 she told me about it this morning in detail might i add
7714535 then i had to listen to her for three hours three hours mer reminiscing about her sex life with uncle hal while you two slept late and she waxed her upper lip in my kitchen you owe me one for this you owe me big time
7714536 and now youre trying to tell me you were lying yesterday when you said you and john were together when aunt marge said she heard john calling out your name last night when he came and this morning three times
7714537 come on mer john sheppard was pining away after you thinking you could never feel the same for him unrequited love and all that and he just jumped on the chance to jump on you when he found out you wanted him as well is that it
7714538 why is it i always get insulted in these conversations
7714539 and think about your story and get straight exactly when it is that you and john sheppard started your relationship and ill get back to you okay
7714540 what is this did i miss the insult rodney mckay week memo or something
7714541 she told jeannie about it it reminded her of her own sex life
7714542 no that would be incest youll have to marry into it instead
7714543 and you know what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
7714544 and in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
7714545 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and me our country will be committed to his cause
7714546 the work will begin anew the hope will rise again and the dream lives on
7714547 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future and to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7714548 barack obama and edward m kennedy their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7714549 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7714550 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7714551 i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world
7714552 we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7714553 let there be no mistake about it we are united
7714554 hillary wants us to support obama the same we supported her and thats what we are gonna do
7714555 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7714556 and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation
7714557 because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7714558 our party and our country has been strengthened by her candidacy
7714559 i know that when you elect barack as president he will be there for you as he has been there for me
7714560 its so wonderful to be here and nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7714561 ive come here tonight to stand with you and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7714562 our conditions were uncomfortable but because were westerners we suffered absolutely nothing compared to what the tibetan people suffer
7714563 they asked about our actions our roles about our lives everything from where i went to high school to everything i ate in china
7714564 it was the scariest it was beyond anything i could imagine in a movie
7714565 when young men are knifing each other on the streets of london and a billion or more people are living on less than 1 a day why is the anglican communion tearing itself apart over two men wanting to make a christian family together
7714566 we are fighting over something that is much less than all those we have raised this one issue of sexuality over and above all the essentials this is at best unhelpful and at worst idolatry
7714567 and said for this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh
7714568 so then they are no longer two but one flesh therefore what god has joined together let not man separate
7714569 sebaiknya anda berpindah tempat karena tempat ini sudah kami pesan
7714570 hei kalau kamu belum tahu biar aku yang kasih tahu dia sudah jadi istriku tolol

7714574 ken if i had killed a little kid accidentally or otherwise i wouldnt have thought twice id killed myself on the fucking spot on the fucking spot i wouldve stuck the gun in me mouth on the fucking spot
7714575 i mean basically if youre robbing a man and youre only carrying blanks and you allow your gun to be taken off you and you allow yourself to be shot in the eye with a blank which i assume that the person has to get quite close to you then yeah really its all your fault for being such a poof so why dont you stop wingeing and cheer the fuck up
7714576 i stay focused on my highest priorities and dont worry about what isnt getting done since its not my highest priority
7714577 i relieve my stress by exercising every morning i also make sure my assistant schedules me in a hotel with an excellent fitness center when im on the road i stayed at a westin last week that had a treadmill in the room
7714578 spending time with my family including weekends at our second home on the lake helps me unwind its good to be in a different environment away from the everyday hustle and bustle
7714579 my mind can usually see things worse than they are i daily need to anchor my thinking in reality not fear of what might happen

7714618 but when i really think back i can also see how the person she is today was formed in the experiences we shared growing up working hard studying hard having parents who wanted more for us than what they had and always being reminded that in this country of all countries those things were possible
7714619 she has continued to follow that passion she gave up a job in a big law firm to work in her community with a group called public allies she trained a new generation of community leaders she developed the university of chicagos community service center connecting the university to the neighborhood that was blocks away but often worlds away from its gates

7714635 although al qaeda spent an estimated 500 000 to plan and execute the sept 11 attacks many of the groups bombings and assaults since then in europe north africa and southeast asia have cost one tenth as much or less
7714636 the cheap plots are evidence that the u s government and its allies fundamentally miscalculated in assuming they could defeat the network by hunting for wealthy financiers and freezing bank accounts according to many u s and european counterterrorism officials
7714637 the groups operating in europe dont need a lot of money
7714638 law enforcement officials in london said al qaeda cells are trained to plot and live on the cheap operatives lead ascetic lives often keeping their day jobs or depending on their families to cover expenses above all they are taught to build bombs that are lethal but crude and inexpensive almost every terrorist plot in europe in recent years has followed a simple formula homemade explosives stuffed into backpacks shoes suitcases or car trunks
7714639 producer states do use oil revenues to fund ideological extremism and saudi financing of madrassas is the primary case in point but given the importance of that undertaking to the saudi government it was instituted after all to defend the house of sauds position of leadership in the islamic world in response to criticism from radical shiites from iran its unlikely that the saudis would cease and desist simply because profits were down they certainly werent deterred by meager oil profits in the 1990s

7714687 i know the son of a single mom will stand up for the needs of our daughters
7714688 this is as close as im going to get to the great gatsby
7714689 i wouldnt consider it a long shot a number of times already hes shown his willingness to come to new jersey and jersey city on two or three occasions
7714690 of course we have it all depends on how this goes here the guy has a lot of work ahead of him weve got a good neighbor to the south now in joe biden
7714691 she got more votes than he obama did ive seen conventions where candidates with three or four thousand votes got nominated what is the problem
7714692 people are released with the idea that if they still feel the need to vote for her whether its emotionally philosophically that there would be no recrimination for doing so
7714693 maybe some questions like how do i make sure im showing support for barack obama at the same time acknowledging that sen clintons journey was historic as well you dont get to have two different votes
7714694 you cant help but feel like something important was taken away
7714695 people need to recognize the historic nature of what was accomplished it would be good to recognize that at this convention
7714696 we know that when we walk out of here after thursday night we are all going to be working to elect obama president it will be a totally unified group
7714697 and so my plea to you is lets get this family together and win this election this fall
7714698 in many ways our work is just beginning about what needs to be done
7714699 i think what we heard from the board is that there is an understanding about the plan and good support for the plan were going to look at this as a partnership and get out in the community and tell the story about this plan and why were asking the community to understand it
7714700 theres a good feeling but at the same time were not taking anything for granted this is an important consideration for both the kids as well as the taxpayers of the community
7714701 theres a significant number of people in the middle that need to be informed and have accurate information
7714702 going forward we have 70 days between now and the election and we need to focus on community engagement
7714703 we need to tell the big picture story not we need money now but the big picture of where the schools are what our vision is for the education of our children it is going to be a busy time because we truly want to be visible and community engagement is going to be our no 1 priority

7714722 holding the olympics was good in terms of china taking a more democratic path we believe this is an irreversible path
7714723 while the reformist open door policy is said to be making progress in china it is not always leaping forward
7714724 i think our friends in china have hosted a highly successful olympic games
7714725 lets remember that these games have been free of violence and this is a very uncertain world that we live in
7714726 i dont know of a single olympic games in recent history which has not generated controversy of one sort or another
7714727 when the chinese leadership sees the system questioned it does not respect basic freedoms as we know them that is why i am strictly against saying it is all good
7714728 the city has opened up and people are mixing like they did in moscow when i was there in 1980
7714729 it was maybe an opportunity missed for the chinese to demonstrate their willingness to be more open and to allow more
7714730 the chinese authorities and the ioc had an opportunity to demonstrate but in most respects they failed to deliver
7714731 forced evictions detention of activists and restrictions on journalists should not blight another olympics
7714732 the games was a historic climax of three decades of china opening to the world
7714733 we dont want to give the message that there are no connections
7714734 it is clear that more research is necessary to pinpoint the reasons for this cluster including whether environmental contaminants are a factor
7714735 dear joe thanks for writing at times like these when everyone is complaining about the tough economy i simply look at a chart on my wall that shows the trend of the past hundred years through wars recessions depression and the threat of nuclear annihilation the long term trend has been up and i believe that trend will continue in general im more bullish on china and india than on the u s and sorry ireland but thats only because the growth rates of china and india are faster as to investing at the present time undoubtedly the best times to invest are when people feel worst the correlation is not as good with recessions for several reasons one of which involves the inaccuracies of measuring economic output best wishes timothy lutts
7714736 this companys colorful lightweight anti fungal non marking low priced thermoplastic shoes look funny to us
7714737 our international business is growing much faster than we originally expected
7714738 on the surface crocs third quarter earnings looked fine with triple digit growth in both sales and earnings but the companys outlook wasnt as good as hoped sending the stock over a cliff you might think that the report didnt warrant such a collapse and you would be correct to a point earnings estimates were actually hiked following the report but the outlook still calls for sharply decelerating growth next year which can be poison to a growth stock the bottom line is that crox is totally broken and it will take months at least before the stock is ready to make a serious sustained advance its disappointing but your best move is to sell and move on to greener pastures
7714739 so how do you avoid being blindsided like that if youre investing in the strongest growth stocks sometimes you cant but there are ways to minimize the pain first you need a diversified portfolio and you need to sell those losers quickly when they fall apart finally you need to be an early buyer when the trends turn positive those hurt hardest by croxs collapse were the late buyers and what of crox now is the stock attractive at this level not to growth investors its heavily damaged chart means that every rebound will be met by selling and getting the remaining disappointed shareholders out will take time a year or two down the road if crocs management executes its diversification plan as expected it may become attractive as the next nike but it will never duplicate the excitement of its first 18 months of life those days are gone
7714740 excitement about this tiny companys future growth has been driving its stock to new peaks because of its small size the small number of shares outstanding the revolutionary product and its big profit margins we believe taser has the potential to be a big winner
7714741 the taser story is one of surging demand for the companys non lethal weapons and explosive revenue and earnings growth while those fundamental factors are great whats more important to us as investors is the stocks strength and momentum even though weve taken big profits in the stock the stocks underperformance has troubled us for months this week as the market was bouncing tasr struggled to hold above its important 200 day moving average signs of decreasing sponsorship another thing that troubles us is how bullish many investors remain about the stocks future prospects they believe it will head to the moon again while this is certainly possible until the bulls capitulate its unlikely the stock will make any sustainable headway taser is our weakest stock so were taking our final profit if youre still holding sell now and sideline the cash
7714742 be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue do not now seek the answers which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them and the point is to live everything live the questions now perhaps you will then gradually without noticing it live along some distant day into the answer

7714782 bagi saya dalam beberapa hari ini merupakan masa yang teramat sulit dalam karir saya keputusan yang saya buat benar benar tidak mudah namun faktor positif menjelang berakhirnya karir profesional saya maka hal ini sungguh sulit untuk saya tolak
7714783 tentu saja kejadian ini begitu cepat dan saya harus pergi setiap pemain bila seumuran saya tentunya tidak akan berpikir dua kali lagi dalam menerima tawaran itu
7714784 i found the cooking of the inhabitants of the slum in soweto in south africa a lot more diverse than ours
7714785 its true im going to be harsh but i think a lot of english peoples food lacks heart its bland
7714786 its true in the centre of london and in the big northern cities
7714787 its nothing to do with famine or war quite the opposite england is one of the richest countries in the world
7714788 the people im telling you about have huge tv sets a lot bigger than mine they have state of the art mobile phones cars and they go and get drunk in pubs at the weekend their poverty shows in the way they feed themselves
7714789 in the past british cuisine was similar to italian cuisine nowadays without the pasta and risotto
7714790 steam cooking grilled meat herbs spices we used to cook fabulous dishes its all in the past
7714791 unlike french people and i regret it we lost our traditions
7714792 i saw him throw his finger toward the showers and i thought what are you talking about
7714793 youre going to throw me out and the games already over youre cool
7714794 he doesnt need help hes got 49 saves he doesnt need help getting 50
7714795 obviously i would take as many offensive guys as we can get
7714796 you have to save a roster spot for madieu believing that hes going to be back
7714797 we are hoping on that but at the same time you have to make sure that you dont put a guy on the street that can help your football team
7714798 the problem is playing toronto cincinnati and beijing then coming back here in two weeks two times 12 hours jet lag
7714799 im a little bit more tired than i usually am but at the same time i must be very happy how i did this year
7714800 i was holding the medal for three days to make sure its not a dream its real
7714801 its really very hard not to think about the olympic games yesterday i was trying to go to sleep but i couldnt because my mind is still there
7714802 j t s been better than the other two and there hasnt really been much of a gray area
7714803 his plays been better at the position than what weve had at any point in the last three years
7714804 my comment to peter was talking about the entire position and ill talk to peter because i know him well as the conversation was going i said the position is playing better than it has at any time since ive been here not any one in particular i have been pleased with the way the individuals have played but alex is playing at a very high level as well in my opinion so it was a position comment
7714805 ive said all along that i think weve got three guys we can win with
7714806 i know what i said and i know what i was thinking i was thinking the same thing ive told you guys every day since weve been out here
7714807 i would hope so yes unless something unforeseen happens when they go inside but theyre walking off the field well so we expect them to play
7714808 right now the anticipation is that we go the first series with the first group on both sides of the ball whether we lessen that or increase it right now well start there thats what were looking at
7714809 it depends on how long the first series is well see
7714810 yes he did he practiced almost all of practice yes he looked fine as long as we dont have to take him out of something then pretty much hell feel that the practice is going all right for him
7714811 i hope so yes the plan is to get him in there how many plays maybe a quarter if hes doing okay and his conditioning looks good during the week maybe a little more
7714812 yes because brian de la puente had a little arm issue so we kept him out so we fudged a little bit on the inside but tomorrow we could be back with tony at the other spot
7714813 well it is preseason yes weve gotten better youd like to think so but again its pre season hopefully well just stay on they same course were on
7714814 its good competition you know takeo is still learning the defense obviously his standing you know not being here for the mini camps and otas and all those things thats natural but hes doing a good job other than that with takeo as all players will once they get familiar with the language and the system its easier for them to start playing it at a higher level and right now hes doing fine but he doesnt know all the hes still feeling it out
7714815 right now hes just competing with ulbrich and thats probably were not necessarily trying to unseat somebody were just trying to get better i guess you could say
7714816 he just told me they were ill thats all jeff ferguson told me so theyre ill
7714817 i dont believe allen like i said the other day i dont believe hes going to play this week so i dont know that thats 100 percent so well wait and see
7714818 its the severity of whatever sprain it is but youre right high ankles typically are worse than i dont want to say low ankle but regular ankle sprains but at the same time all of them have a different degree of severity so i dont know what his will be like
7714819 i think he has a contusion it was in his back i dont know if it was from his back to his lungs or all i can really say is he had a bodily contusion thats what he had i really dont know the specifics
7714820 well the quarterback we already did and that was a tough call wide receiver will be a tough call theres still some good competition going on where guys are playing hard from a playing time standpoint dashon goldson has done a good job throughout training camp right now it seems to be set the way were doing it but those guys are still fighting some of those guys really want to be the guy theyre still competing at it i would say right now the one thats the most undecided is probably wide receiver at least at that one spot the split end spot
7714821 yes really with bryant johnson and josh morgan if the two of them dont play this week well wait and see because josh is ill anyway well have to feel that out
7714822 robert ortiz i thought about possibly arnaz battle but i dont know if im going to do that necessarily so right now ortiz can take it and well see michael robinson is back so we might be able to get him and delanie walker a little bit more kickoff stuff
7714823 its already been told to me look guys as i said our quarterback position is the strongest its been since ive been here the conversation as they all do especially on the phone they call around to different places and i dont know
7714824 as a group yes as ive said all along it fits what ive said all along and that is we have three guys we can win with again i think he i could answer for him but i know what i said and i know what i was thinking i was thinking the same thing ive been telling you guys every day weve been out here
7714825 vernons having a really good camp hes had a good camp as a matter of fact today he made a couple of nice moves and as was evident the other day in the game he had a couple things i think hes done a good job im pleased when we get ready to go for the season well see but hes good
7714826 i am excited we speak about these things and i can watch practice and kind of see how thats going to be but youre right mike is very excited about him as he is about frank gore although mikes had some very good players in the past hes had good running backs but different from frank so hes excited about the dimensions and elements that frank can add but as a tight end without question hes had some good tight ends but theyve been kind of blocker or receiver that kind of thing one or the other whereas with vernon hes pretty versatile the other night he blocked as good as he did on a couple of catches that he had hes always getting better and vernons working hard at it which is good hes a hard worker thats probably the biggest reason that vernons going to keep getting better all the time because its not like pulling teeth when you ask him to work hard he works hard without coaching him and thats a good thing
7714827 well what impressed me was whenever he goes in he gets yards last years preseason if im not mistaken he was the leading rusher in preseason i could be wrong but i think he was so when he gets his opportunities because sometimes plays are designed to go certain places and he may not in practice someone might say youve got to do this youve got to do that so in anticipation of the game you think god if he just stays true to his read hell have a big run but whether he goes true or cuts it off he finds the hole and really thats what its about you dont want run to darkness as a running back you want to run to the daylight he seems to find it
7714828 jonas was having a good camp its unfortunate that he got nicked up there but hell be back so thats good
7714829 i cant recall the first and second one and last year i know he was banged up i think the second one he was banged up its unfair for me because i cant recall to be honest with you i dont care about any of them anymore as long as this one thats the one that matters
7714830 of course it is frustrating when you are not on the field but the best i could do was stay on top of my rehab and in my playbook
7714831 every day i just worked my butt off because i wanted to get back earlier than the opener so i had some extra time to get my timing my feet and my hands down and have my brain fresh im glad to get a start on that this week because it gives me more days in so that by the time arizona rolls around im not missing a beat
7714832 weve got full pads tomorrow and so ill bang it around and really test it and see how it feels if it feels good i can move on from there
7714833 thats the plan theres nothing like game speed so id like to get in there and knock whatever rust i have off
7714834 tomorrow it could be back with tony at the other spot
7714835 oh man we have just had heaps of response its been much easier than i thought
7714836 people seem to be quite keen to come here so i am quite surprised
7714837 i have got a few bookings so things are looking good a fews better than none i tell myself so fingers crossed
7714838 not that i am aware of i never was aware of it i hardly read the newspapers or watch tv
7714839 i have been told the knitting lady brothel opponent gillian allardice has backed off shes not going to be knitting outside any more
7714840 we dont think that parade is going to enhance our image as the arts and cultural capital of new zealand
7714841 we dont want to make a big fuss over this event it isnt the type of high quality event we want wellington to be known for
7714842 most of our 1000 or so members would probably be happier if the event did not proceed but if it does we dont want the huge focus on it that was created by the controversy in auckland this year
7714843 we suspect that many auckland businesses likewise dont see the auckland parade doing much for aucklands brand either

7714845 curfew study hall and doing the right things in the classroom
7714846 hes mature he reminds me of a rockstar to be that young i marvel at how well he handles the pressure and how far hes come along in a short amount of time he really doesnt act like a freshman quarterback its been a great transition from high school to now hes taken it so well really taken control of it im proud of him
7714847 marve likes to get out of the pocket and scramble a little bit more jacory likes to stay in the pocket
7714848 if we throw them in for 60 plays and 30 plays they dont know what theyre doing then youll have problems
7714849 we have confidence because we prepared them for the situation
7714850 theyve gotten a lot of reps in scrimmages and what not so i think theyll go into the situation and be ready theyve gotten more work than most freshman have ever here so they wont be as brand new to things
7714851 allen bailey the other day went through the whole entire individual work out and tossed one of the offensive lineman doing drills
7714852 we just got to keep progressing both of them went to the doctor and the doctor said they looked good as long as the doctors say its ok they could play moncur was probably more ahead of bailey but both of them are about equal now
7714853 cook knows the defense like the back of his hand
7714854 when i came in as a freshman he knew the defense like the back of his hand and now he knows this one like that it gives you a lot of confidence when you got a guy in there when you know what to do it gives you a lot of confidence
7714855 the terminology has changed a lot and as we go through the season well pick up on a lot of things
7714856 basically what we have to do is erase everything from the last two years and start all over
7714857 hes graded out real well in all of our scrimmages and practices
7714858 its real surprising when you think hes only been here one year
7714859 i wouldnt compare him to rochford xavier is really athletic rochford was a guy who would beat you with speed xavier has a little more muscle on him he some speed on him too but he definitely can move people around
7714860 one minute you could be getting ready to punt then a first down comes and you might be in field goal range
7714861 things change pretty quickly coach has done a good job preparing us for it all
7714862 you can kick your leg out just like a pitcher throwing too many pitches you almost have to kind of be on a kick count
7714863 jake is a great long snapper and hes really going to do well with field goals im completely confident with him for all of us to get our timing down
7714864 hating your job is a giftbecause its a sign that somethings wrong

7714871 cu lipsa mea de experien de via eram convins c este procedura standard pentru cei care lucrau cu str inii am tratat o ca pe o chestiune pur formal este un fapt evident pentru oricine cite te cu bun credin dosarul pe care l am publicat integral pe internet erau alte timpuri iar logica social func iona dup alte criterii iar oamenii nu pot fi mereu invulnerabili

7714878 this is a great group of players an exceptional group
7714879 with the squad we have we should not have any difficulty finishing in the top three in the league
7714880 id like to mention poulsen he has been a bit of a controversial buy but poulsen has shown he is a great long passer passing the ball 40 metres to feet consistently

7714883 in their english style stadium it will be a battle but we are determined we want to go through
7714884 we were tidy and played with balance but theres lots to work on
7714885 it was a useful international experience van gaal is a maestro and we learned some things such as the fact that opponents like these never throw the ball away
7714886 now our thoughts are on the slavia game and finding continuity
7714887 basically we are trying to make the playoffs in years past we were a young team now we have a bunch of seniors that are ready we have some young guys who are going to step up its exciting because we have athletes all over the field
7714888 i am going to play both ways i love getting the ball i like playing running back i am a down hill guy that runs with power i am not a spread guy i like to run it down your throat
7714889 i think i can play all the lb positions but i like mike and will i can really play both i am good at coming off the edge playing will at mike the coaches let me roam free play sideline to sideline blitz or drop into coverage
7714890 i think playing in the secondary my first few years has helped me play linebacker especially when it comes to coverage my footwork and my drops at the same time i am learning technique reads and stuff like that camping at both florida and florida state this summer really helped me
7714891 i am trying to set up some official visits and i am almost there i think i will visit tennessee when they play florida auburn when they play tennessee and lsu when they play georgia i want to visit usc and either south carolina or clemson i am also looking at some in state schools florida fsu miami and central florida i will not make official visits to those schools because i have already been there and it will be easy for me to take unofficial visits to them later on
7714892 republicans want to make the word hope a bad word
7714893 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned
7714894 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned
7714895 when you give a gift to someone youre hoping to give them something that they can enjoy without aggravation and without incident
7714896 we try to put the information that is most important on the outside of the packaging
7714897 we really want our consumers to understand the product that theyre buying and are looking for new ways to improve that process all the time
7714898 searching lookin for a man all the time i can
7714899 a dining room table is forever this is the table our kids will have all their special dinners at this is the table we will have many family celebrations at this is the table i will meet my future daughter in law
7714900 miss audrey this has been the best day of my life
7714901 we hope the new tools in the hands of home buyers from the recently enacted housing stimulus package will spark a sustained sales uptrend in the months ahead
7714902 buyers whove been on the sidelines should take a closer look at whats available to them now in terms of financing and incentives given some of the inventory on the market we also strongly encourage buyers to get a professional home inspection
7714903 sales have picked up significantly in several florida and california markets home prices generally follow sales trends after a few months of lag time
7714904 still inventory remains high in many parts of the country and will require time to fully absorb we expect more balanced conditions in 2009 and will eventually return to normal long term appreciation patterns
7714905 a reflection of our values of respect tolerance and safe accommodation of student needs
7714906 supreme court cases have been heard on far less obvious violations of our establishment clause
7714907 many if not most american muslims are currently well able to accommodate our own prayers and ablution to the spaces and facilities provided to all other faiths on public grounds without special accommodations islamists use the free exercise clause when it suits them and then turn around and use tax monies in the name of islam when it suits them
7714908 a slippery slope of preferential treatment of one religion over another
7714909 these baths exert a monetary cost upon publicly funded institutions which by our constitution should not appease the financial demands of one faith group over another
7714910 every other faith group on campus should be demanding that they be provided equal funding and space which basically demonstrates how outrageous these accommodations are
7714911 under normal circumstances of 21st century america unless there is some massive protest including a march on the presidents office this minor accommodation which is politically sensitive and seemingly in the eyes of many so far reasonably appropriate will continue to be an unnoticed minor event
7714912 sometimes i wish i were a little kid again skinned knees are easier to fix than broken hearts
7714913 my father hit me so badly my leg was fractured and was in severe pain for a month
7714914 as an additional punishment my father forbade my mother to take me to the doctor
7714915 an officer walked into the house saw the signs of abuse and walked out with my father
7714916 rather than arresting him he took him to the closest bar where they both got drunk
7714917 it takes a great deal of courage to stand up and say i am an alcoholic
7714918 unfortunately my father grew up in a macho society with no freedom of expression personally and politically
7714919 how many times had this same priest seen my mother black and blue with a swollen face missing teeth and fractured bones but had chosen to turn away and say nothing
7714920 instead of being obsessed with building something better should we instead be focused on deconstruction tools that liberate us from institutions and government and business and systems and allow us to apply them to self organized community based networks
7714921 stinginess and one of his commentors supposes that the religious roots of my approach to the world are merely
7714922 explicitly outline your objectives and determine how much of your time is worth allocating to the accomplishment of those objectives blogging is fun so it can eat more and more time some serious cost benefit analysis should precede launching into blogging also think clearly about how your products can be developed promoted and or sold via the blog
7714923 the theory behind the design was to try to bring the american people into the process
7714924 but its an interesting question whether dazzling is what the obama campaign needs right now
7714925 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7714926 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7714927 large companies still cant seem to get the basics of privacy and security on the web pulled together today i went to enter a

7714938 has been a senator for all who believe that the dream has never died
7714939 two men who have changed my life and the life of this country
7714940 but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most this is one of those moments
7714941 come ready for quick decentralized actions spanning the downtown area at a variety of risk levels
7714942 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7714943 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7714944 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7714945 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7714946 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7714947 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7714948 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right

7714952 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7714953 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7714954 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list

7714996 true faith in him who loved us and gave himself for us also seeks direction of the lord as to the sphere of its action and waits upon him to be guided by him in the choice of a calling
7714997 make it honestly if you can but anyhow make money
7714998 callings should be deliberately chosen with a view to our own suitableness for them
7714999 we should also by faith desire such a calling as providence evidently has arranged and intended for us

7715005 and wed go straight from relaxed stretching to 3 on 3 drills where you make the tackle or blow em off the ball coach muschamp has a lot of expectations people are more afraid to make him mad than they are to make 100 000 people mad

7715011 our goal is lets get the facts lets understand what the policy is in the governors office and whether or not that policy was followed
7715012 it eats up a huge amount of resources and the question became is it valuable
7715013 twilight festival took the resources that could be better used elsewhere
7715014 we do have to pull back on other areas in order to make the festival happen
7715015 some folks most bars and restaurants did pretty decent business during the festivals
7715016 some of the shopkeepers saw their business go down a little bit because the crowds would keep their regular customers away
7715017 what it boiled down to was downtown is a different place now than it was 19 years ago and theres a lot of other things going on
7715018 its not like downtown is going to dry up and blow away if we dont have twilight festival
7715019 havelocks behavior is shocking and there must be some type of psychological testing

7715025 the questions posed to mr bonds by two different prosecutors at his grand jury appearance were imprecise redundant overlapping and frequently compound

7715027 i was told nothing could make it worse which is why i wanted to pitch through it it just hasnt gone away
7715028 weve all seen john maine even without his best stuff if im not mistaken he had a pretty good game in pittsburgh
7715029 but the bottom line is we cannot risk his long term health in the midst of this pennant race which means that guys are going to have to step up
7715030 its been tough to watch running back rudi johnson said
7715031 i can safely say its a carry over guard bobbie williams said
7715032 we had some not lolly gagging but just kind of going through the motions a little bit in practice speaking for myself and stuff carries over
7715033 weve got to correct that point blank frustrated about that yes totally we absolutely cannot continue to let carson get hit we cannot allow that to happen period
7715034 its just a matter of can i run with people pushing on me that type of stuff well see
7715035 ive talked to a lot of people who have played with this injury said johnson who wears a protective harness on the shoulder
7715036 they didnt get surgery and they played and had a successful season so ill be fine
7715037 i asked marvin to play thursday not to prove a point but to show that im ready to go johnson said
7715038 and he told me no theres no need i already got hurt in one preseason game theres no reason for another i will be ready for the opener

7715047 cameron has yet to seal the deal with the electorate
7715048 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
7715049 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
7715050 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder
7715051 should i be more careful of what i do or is living exactly how i want to the best way especially when positive change comes from it

7715057 to be part of the 2008 olympic team to play with the best players in the world and to be on this team its just amazing
7715058 it really meant a lot to me especially after the last two seasons that ive had injury wise and that the miami heat have had it can bring us back to life not just me but bring miami back i had a lot to prove going over there
7715059 for our team for myself individually to come out and have that kind of performance early in the first half to keep us afloat it really meant a lot to me personally after all the things that have been said and all the question marks about whether i was even going to make the team and i became a big part of the team
7715060 theres been a lot that went on in my life to get to this point
7715061 when i won a championship everything was going great as an adult nothing went wrong ive had a lot of things that went bad since then

7715067 i started out here she said monday after a 6 4 6 2 victory over aleksandra wozniak in the first round
7715068 the first year i got a wild card into the main draw and i had played juniors before thinking that i was out of league and that i was just so fortunate to be able to walk on the grounds
7715069 becoming a champion of it and then becoming a player with really good results and now coming back as a mom and as a former no 1 and the champion i mean its just all overwhelming davenport said
7715070 i thought i played pretty well considering i havent really played since april and had been injured she said
7715071 i knew i drew a tough opponent in the first round so im happy to have played the way i did and get through in the scoreline in the fashion i did
7715072 all of a sudden just right before the olympics it seemed to turn a corner she said
7715073 i have no idea what happened but it feels better now
7715074 now that ive started to work really hard off the court you go into the matches with sort of no excuses no worries he said after beating sergio roitman of argentina 6 3 6 4 6 0 in the first round monday
7715075 its a complete waste of time going on the court and finding reasons why you might lose the match and what have you you just go out there and fight for every single point because thats a complete waste of time putting the work in if youre not going to use it out on the court murray said
7715076 a similar crash is not something we want to investigate in north carolina

7715089 la informaci n que tenemos es que la ni a se acerc a los agentes de la polic a iraqu diciendo que llevaba puesto un chaleco explosivo y que no quer a explotar con l
7715090 si fue obligada a ponerse el chaleco o si lo hizo voluntariamente es lo que estamos investigando
7715091 el hecho de que la ni a se haya entregado quiere decir que los iraqu es siguen rechazando a al qaeda y sus pr cticas
7715092 under state law we had to run 50 days of live racing before we opened the card room on june 30
7715093 we had losses that were not unanticipated from harness racing without the card room we had better than expected attendance but it was an educational process for people to learn about betting the take from the racing was less than expected minnesotans are conservative
7715094 now we are operating the card room its been well received were still working on marketing to expand awareness were just getting off the ground next year it will be great to have harness racing and the card room at the same time
7715095 we anticipated the losses at running aces which were primarily due to pre opening expenses including hiring and training more than 500 employees and the cost of completing the first live race meet before we were permitted to open the card room
7715096 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7715097 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7715098 circle circle dot dot now i have my cootie shot
7715099 when youre a little kid youre a bit of everything scientist philosopher artist sometimes it seems like growing up is giving these things up one at a time
7715100 no one can make you feel inferior without your consent

7715105 while the mps mishap pilots had regained their currency and qualifications it is questionable whether they had regained the proficiency held before the af stand down of all f 15cs
7715106 however there is insufficient evidence to conclude that pilot proficiency directly contributed to the cause of this mishap
7715107 they were both competent and proficient to perform this activity
7715108 were they as proficient as they could have been i cant answer that question
7715109 bryan has been around a number of years now and he has been a good defenseman for quite some time
7715110 im excited about bryans willingness to come here on a tryout it will certainly pick up the competition level of what is going to take place in training camp
7715111 carls going to say hes sorry and that he didnt mean to race that way the way he always does mr ed like
7715112 have you ever heard him say he means to spin anybody out
7715113 the steering wheel must have come out of my hand and i ended up hitting him
7715114 i think we need to get used to great racing here being side by side racing rather than wreck each other racing
7715115 weve got more racing room here theres still going to be bumping and banging but its not going to be like it was before because its not a one groove racetrack anymore
7715116 i think the fans see more true racing on this surface rather than give and take and nudging people out of the way for every position
7715117 so i think this is better i think youre going to see exciting races here for a long time to come
7715118 its hard to pass extremely hard to pass but the track is small enough that theres always something going on
7715119 the history i remember is him busch running into me real hard at richmond
7715120 so it gave us essentially seven days to find a new place to live pack everything we own pack our sons stuff up and move before the 31st when we may not have power water hot water
7715121 i couldnt get out my fire escape there was smoke everywhere you couldnt see nothing it was all black and the flames was already starting to come into my apartment and the only way to go was through my window
7715122 when i came running up and heard maritsa screaming and i looked up and saw her and then i turned around and saw firefighter robinson with the ladder already so we just our instinct kicked in and we put the ladder up and i went up to get her
7715123 theres going to be an independent kosovo were dedicated to that
7715124 in our statement we recorded our fundamental position that the unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo contradicts resolution 1244 russia india and china encourage belgrade and pristina to resume talks within the framework of international law and hope they reach an agreement on all problems of that serbian territory

7715127 hating your job is a giftbecause its a sign that somethings wrong
7715128 the point was really to introduce michelle to the public for the first time and let them see that she is very different from the caricatures displayed in the news
7715129 michelle is not a politician she is a mother and a wife and a working woman and a community organizer
7715130 he still has trouble putting the bread up and putting his socks actually in the dirty clothes and he still doesnt do a better job than our 5 year old daughter sasha making his bed so you have to forgive me if im a little stunned by this whole barack obama thing
7715131 for the first in my adult life i am proud of my country because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback
7715132 the selfish part of her would say she wants him home for her children
7715133 but for the sake of her children she wants him to win this election
7715134 so i think theyre at a different point in their life now
7715135 but there is a sacrifice i dont want to underestimate that
7715136 its been a great challenge working at fremantle and im very optimistic about the future of the fremantle football club
7715137 im intensely proud of my contribution to fremantle and the role that i have played in its growth
7715138 however being apart from gayle and the girls has not been easy
7715139 they have been a tower of strength during my time here at fremantle and i know that their support will continue into the next phase of my football career
7715140 he just ate the cue ball off my pool table whole
7715141 he eats everything in sight the little pig sorry ill pay for the cue ball and stuff
7715142 oh you on the street the hotel isnt actually on it keep going and youll come to a four way intersection turn right and i think it was on the right
7715143 time history and esch atology in the thought of thomas hobbes
7715144 had a strong commitment to the calv inist christianity of jacobean england
7715145 fear of power invisible feigned by the mind or imagined from t ales publicly allowed
7715146 neutral on the issue of whether any religion is true or not
7715147 it would have been absurd for hobbes to c oncoct original theories for christian doctrines if he were not intellectually committed to them
7715148 food stamp sales have grown to 90 000 in 2007 from 3 000 in 2002
7715149 id turned 40 that year we had a minivan lived in suburbia and were a very career based couple
7715150 it was a lot different from when we first got together and we thought it would be a great way to change our sex life and spice up our marriage
7715151 we knew 100 days was going to be a challenge and it wasnt always easy after a long day especially when i got really sick halfway through
7715152 almost everyone we spoke to said my god that sounds difficult but we wanted to see what would happen to us and we made it and are happy we did so
7715153 problems with sex are usually the symptom of a relationship gone bad not the cause and i wouldnt say sex on its own is the answer
7715154 the act of consciously putting in daily energy into a relationship is essential to its vitality and longevity and this has to be done on all levels not just the sexual
7715155 in theory the gist of what theyre trying to do put effort into the relationship is absolutely what needs to be done
7715156 i look at it as a metaphor one hundred days of straight sex is not necessarily going to fix things but it is a great metaphor for putting the energy back into a relationship
7715157 sex is the second basic instinct after survival thats how important it is
7715158 it can become boring and predictable same place same time and finding the reason why it deteriorated will determine the right solution
7715159 the big mistake counselors make is assuming there is one solution and they forget that anger and resentment can build to the point that while you love someone you dont like them
7715160 sometimes being unfaithful can be a wake up call so long as the couple talk about why it happened and have them promise not to do it again
7715161 it was a great idea and some days were really fun
7715162 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7715163 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to its best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7715164 for me this is a season of hope new hope for justice and fair prosperity for the many and not just for the few
7715165 barack obama will close the book on the old politics of race and gender and group against group and straight against gay
7715166 the same thing weve been hearing from hillary clinton for the past couple of months which is that she supports senator obama as we all do
7715167 we are going to move forward united to change the team thats in the white house
7715168 now i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us and let me state what i think about their tactics and these ads i am hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7715169 john mccain has a compelling biography he served america with bravery and distinction and he deserves a respect for that but his policies dont deserve respect
7715170 his ideas dont deserve respect because theyre the same old ideas that weve seen out of george bush for the last eight years
7715171 what happens to a dream deferred when you pick it up again for another look
7715172 he was a strong proud influential republican jim is here because he knows red and blue are not as important as red white and blue
7715173 the change obama is advocating is a clarion call for renewal that taps republican as well as democratic traditions
7715174 in troubled times it was understood that country comes before party
7715175 the party that once emphasized individual rights now wants to regulate values
7715176 this is not a time for politics as usual or for run of the mill politicians little is riskier to america than more of the same
7715177 i heard there were a whole bunch of people returning them for some reason is there something wrong with the prius
7715178 be forced to provide services that violate their own conscience

7715182 si le pedimos a los delegados aqu y a los votantes de todo el pa s que elijan qui n va a reconstruir la econom a y devolver el trabajo a las familias qui n va a ofrecer seguridad de noche qui n va a reducir la dependencia del petr leo extranjero la mejor persona para hacer esas cosas no es john mccain sino barack obama
7715183 quieren un l der en cuyo juicio y experiencia puedan confiar
7715184 cuando hillary clinton fue claramente en las primarias dem cratas una mujer una persona con grandes aptitudes para el debate
7715185 queremos que la gente se asegure de qui n es el senador obama y d nde quiere llevar al pa s y deseamos que los votantes conozcan sus opciones en esta elecci n

7715190 the most significant driver in the quarter continued to be an upswing in x86 server replacements that started in the first quarter this coupled with web data center build outs and growth in emerging markets produced solid q2 results
7715191 my inter will play better than the opposition and win 3 0
7715192 this is a great group of players an exceptional group
7715193 in their english style stadium it will be a battle but we are determined we want to go through
7715194 we were tidy and played with balance but theres lots to work on
7715195 it was a useful international experience van gaal is a maestro and we learned some things such as the fact that opponents like these never throw the ball away
7715196 now our thoughts are on the slavia game and finding continuity
7715197 with the squad we have we should not have any difficulty finishing in the top three in the league
7715198 id like to mention poulsen he has been a bit of a controversial buy but poulsen has shown he is a great long passer passing the ball 40 metres to feet consistently
7715199 for me the champions league is the most important thing it seems to me we have good prospects

7715207 senator barack obama says that he is a reformer an agent of positive change andlooking at his record though in chicago springfield and washington i found that he is absolutely theres nothing in his record to bear out that claim
7715208 one must learn to love and go through a good deal of suffering to get to it and the journey is always towards the other soul
7715209 she had not known the weight until she felt the freedom
7715210 do you know where this is going if it keeps progressing
7715211 i can see me getting scratched and bitten and you getting slapped and fucked
7715212 will the democratic party which is committed to say theleast to gender equity and which in fact has a 50 percent quota for femaledelegates accept obamas imposition of a glass ceiling at itsconvention
7715213 national security intelligence organizations should monitor advances in cognitive neuroscience research

7715221 would be how can we disrupt the enemys motivation to fight other questions raised by controlling the mind how can we make people trust us more what if we could help the brain to remove fear or pain is there a way to make the enemy obey our commands as cognitive neuroscience and related technologies become more pervasive using technology for nefarious purposes becomes easier
7715222 the potential impact of neuroscience research is greater than previously thought
7715223 battlefield commanders of all nations hold sacrosanct the right to determine the applications
7715224 if governments or scientists were to try to develop a system to pre screen neuroscientific cognitive manipulators which would be hipaa approved and tested and robust in its core science success would be as likely as it was with mines and cluster bombs meaning not likely
7715225 the concept of torture could also be altered by products in this market it is possible that someday there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects

7715242 there is a limit how long you can do this there is a point where you take over the market
7715243 if we see banks becoming very dependent on central banks then we must push them to tap other sources of funding
7715244 nobody dares pinpoint the country involved because as soon as we do it will cause a market reaction and lead to a meltdown for the banks
7715245 what we should avoid is some kind of arbitrage by banks which say they are going to go to central bank x instead of central bank y because conditions are more attractive

7715253 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7715254 the only time to eat diet food is while youre waiting for the steak to cook
7715255 everyone has internal damnation waiting to rear and wreak its vindictive and sadistic means
7715256 everyone has internal damnation waiting to rear and wreak its vindictive and sadistic means
7715257 the right to swing my fist ends where the other mans nose begins
7715258 with so many of the same values the wife of the democratic candidate for president said tonight
7715259 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7715260 all of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do she said
7715261 that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
7715262 that is why i love this country and in my own life in my own small way ive tried to give back to this country that has given me so much
7715263 as you might imagine for barack running for president is nothing compared to that first game of basketball with my brother craig
7715264 at six foot six ive often felt like craig was looking down on me too literally
7715265 but each of us also comes here tonight by way of our own improbable journey
7715266 and i come here as a daughter raised on the south side of chicago by a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me
7715267 he and my mom poured everything they had into me and craig it was the greatest gift a child can receive never doubting for a single minute that youre loved and cherished and have a place in this world and thanks to their faith and hard work we both were able to go on to college
7715268 so i know firsthand from their lives and mine that the american dream endures
7715269 and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7715270 and as our friendship grew and i learned more about barack he introduced me to the work hed done when he first moved to chicago after college
7715271 the people gathered together that day were ordinary folks doing the best they could to build a good life
7715272 but he reminded us that we know what our world should look like we know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like and he urged us to believe in ourselves to find the strength within ourselves to strive for the world as it should be
7715273 and isnt that the great american story its the story of men and women gathered in churches and union halls in town squares and high school gyms people who stood up and marched and risked everything they had refusing to settle determined to mold our future into the shape of our ideals
7715274 it is because of their will and determination that this week we celebrate two anniversaries the 88th anniversary of women winning the right to vote and the 45th anniversary of that hot summer day when dr king lifted our sights and our hearts with his dream for our nation
7715275 i stand here today at the crosscurrents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7715276 the military families who say grace each night with an empty seat at the table the servicemen and women who love this country so much they leave those they love most to defend it
7715277 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7715278 all of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do
7715279 that is why i love this country and in my own life in my own small way ive tried to give back to this country that has given me so much thats why i left a job at a law firm for a career in public service working to empower young people to volunteer in their communities
7715280 because i believe that each of us no matter what our age or background or walk of life each of us has something to contribute to the life of this nation
7715281 its what he did in the illinois senate moving people from welfare to jobs passing tax cuts for hard working families and making sure women get equal pay for equal work
7715282 thats why hes running to end the war in iraq responsibly to build an economy that lifts every family to make health care available for every american and to make sure every child in this nation gets a world class education all the way from preschool to college
7715283 thats what barack obama will do as president of the united states of america hell achieve these goals the same way he always has by bringing us together and reminding us how much we share and how alike we really are
7715284 you see barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world
7715285 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7715286 it was strong enough to bring hope to those neighborhoods in chicago
7715287 and it was strong enough to bring hope to people who came out on a cold iowa night and became the first voices in this chorus for change thats been echoed by millions of americans from every corner of this nation
7715288 and in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
7715289 and as i tuck that little girl and her little sister into bed at night i think about how one day theyll have families of their own
7715290 how this time in this great country where a girl from the south side of chicago can go to college and law school and the son of a single mother from hawaii can go all the way to the white house we committed ourselves to building the world as it should be
7715291 so tonight in honor of my fathers memory and my daughters future out of gratitude to those whose triumphs we mark this week and those whose everyday sacrifices have brought us to this moment let us devote ourselves to finishing their work
7715292 everyone has internal damnation waiting to rear and wreak its vindictive and sadistic means

7715294 if somebody lost a hand wouldnt it be cool to give them a robotic hand that attached to their nerves and worked like a regular hand
7715295 cool because of how lukes hand was replaced at the end of empire strikes back will it be that good
7715296 im sure it wont look that lifelike not at first but its a whole lot better than what theyve got now
7715297 id make mine a hollow robotic hand that helped the person grow a new hand inside of it
7715298 wow okay now thats a good idea so it would be a prosthetic and a regrowth chamber
7715299 cool but how would it work how would it help somebody regrow their hand
7715300 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7715301 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7715302 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7715303 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7715304 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7715305 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7715306 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7715307 i come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama
7715308 together we have known success and seen setbacks victory and defeat but we have never lost our belief that we are all called to build a better country and a newer world and i pledge to you that i will be there on the floor of the when we begin
7715309 a season of hope new hope for a justice and prosperity for a justice and prosperity for the many not just the few
7715310 decent quality health care as a fundamental right and not a privilege
7715311 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans
7715312 not merely victory for our party but renewal for our nation
7715313 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7715314 she crisscrosses the country on the company jet keeps an accountant on the company payroll to mind her
7715315 her business recently found itself at odds with advocates for pediatric hospital beds in arizonas neediest communities and for a statewide childhood education program when the advocates proposed initiatives that would raise liquor taxes hensley opposed them
7715316 at the national level the companys priorities fought for by the national beer wholesalers association include rolling back the national excise tax of about 5 cents a beer last raised in 1991 and fighting efforts by hard liquor distillers to require labels showing the amount of alcohol in a standard serving the beer lobby also successfully opposed a bill to pay for television advertisements combating under age drinking
7715317 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7715318 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7715319 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7715320 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7715321 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7715322 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7715323 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7715324 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7715325 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7715326 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7715327 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7715328 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7715329 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7715330 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7715331 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7715332 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7715333 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7715334 everyone has internal damnation waiting to rear and wreak its vindictive and sadistic means
7715335 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7715336 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7715337 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7715338 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7715339 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7715340 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7715341 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7715342 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7715343 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7715344 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7715345 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7715346 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7715347 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7715348 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7715349 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7715350 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7715351 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7715352 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7715353 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7715354 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7715355 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7715356 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7715357 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7715358 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7715359 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7715360 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7715361 i am gaius i am guarding that door you just came out of you were in there you are one of them nevertheless are you well

7715383 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7715384 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7715385 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7715386 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7715387 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7715388 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7715389 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7715390 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7715391 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7715392 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7715393 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7715394 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7715395 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7715396 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7715397 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7715398 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7715399 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7715400 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7715401 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7715402 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7715403 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

7715416 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law

7715424 its really flattering too you know to think that idol even thought about me
7715425 i mean when i got the call i thought they were calling the wrong person so im the new kid on the block and im hoping everyones gonna go easy on me and that i bring a lot to the table
7715426 im maybe not a household name but people know of me in the industry
7715427 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7715428 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7715429 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7715430 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7715431 id say i believe in what i believe in and im willing to fight for it and im pretty feisty
7715432 that when their song comes on the radio i know exactly who it is its not about vocal acrobatics
7715433 it would really help us if you would stay on the bus you chose today

7715441 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart
7715442 at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
7715443 we have taken the decision after thorough discussion among the party leaders and after the ppp failed to fulfil promises made to restore the sacked judges
7715444 non partisan nationally respected and accepted by the coalition partners
7715445 i am saddened to announce this but we are left with no other option
7715446 we have all respect for the pml n and we expect that the party will review its decision in the larger national interest
7715447 we will request the pml n not to leave the coalition as the ppp is determined to restore the judges
7715448 this is a welcome step and we hope that sharif will join the apdm for the betterment of the country and democracy
7715449 we have now the required numbers and have no fear that the government will fall if the ppp pulls out from the provincial coalition in punjab
7715450 it is certainly not good for the country or for democracy and could prove a very bad patch in the countrys politics
7715451 mobile advertising in india can be bigger than internet advertising in the next three four years
7715452 as such everyone benefits the key lies in publishers creating media on mobile based on sms and permission from the subscribers
7715453 but it is just starting mobile ad spend is currently estimated to be just about rs 250 300 million
7715454 we term it invertising invited advertising we think the blue ocean lies in enabling brands and businesses to build relationships with consumers on the mobile
7715455 to make it even more catchy consumers can be given incentives such as free talk time if they opt for ads
7715456 operator portal and sms advertising are just starting to happen mytoday has seen over 100 brands use the platform with over 30 percent of them repeating campaigns
7715457 the overall advertising opportunity is either text based such as sms or voice based such as branded caller tune or ring back tunes with ads
7715458 agencies and media planners are still taking time to understand the potential
7715459 what shall i spend the rest of my day doing
7715460 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7715461 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7715462 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black

7715470 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7715471 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7715472 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7715473 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7715474 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7715475 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7715476 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7715477 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
7715478 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower

7715538 what it will mean is that theres a recognition of each countrys regulatory framework in so far as securities trading is concerned he told abc radio from washington
7715539 practically that will mean that australian brokers and the asx australian stock exchange can direct trade on securities in the us and visa versa
7715540 so it cuts out whats known as a chaperoning arrangement it cuts out red tape compliance and reduces cost for australians and reduces costs for us investors
7715541 i just got clarification on that yes you can he said
7715542 if a brokerage firm or the asx have operations online you can do it through that format
7715543 i think there might be interest in both countries because it does reduce compliance costs and red tape and there are savings involved for operating through the mutual agreement he said
7715544 very importantly this is the first time that the united states has recognised any other countrys jurisdiction in the world we are the first
7715545 they have recognised that australia does have a reliable regulatory framework in securities trading such that the us will recognise australias robustness and regulatory oversight
7715546 therell be more liquidity therell be more flow i think broadly will be the improvement and therell be a reduce compliance and red tape cost in investment and thats got to be a good thing he said
7715547 we have a connection and i really do care about you but i just cant love you

7715565 they seem to care for the welfare of those they know
7715566 subjects systematically favored the prosocial option provided their partner was a familiar b visible and c receiving rewards of equal value
7715567 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7715568 we believe prosocial behavior is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices
7715569 capuchin monkeys spontaneously share food in both nature and captivity and commonly sit next to each other while eating
7715570 the idea had kind of been floating around because people had noticed these bats with no injuries
7715571 when people were first starting to talk about the issue it was bats running into the turbine blades we always said no
7715572 i can pick up nine different species of bird i can pick up two species of bat
7715573 but the larger the animal is the bigger the air pressure drop has to be we know that four kilopascals a unit of pressure is enough to kill a rat bats are much smaller we found that these wind turbines produce a five to 10 kilopascal drop
7715574 its one of those things we have speculated on for a long time
7715575 its an important finding on the cause of the fatalities theyre not offered much room for error if they avoid being struck at the last minute they still may be killed by this rapid change in air pressure
7715576 it may not lead us directly to any solution whether theyre getting struck or theyre dying from the barotrauma may or may not make any difference we have to find ways to keep them away from the turbines
7715577 there are a lot of people testing different forms of mitigation
7715578 right now the most promising one is to shut turbines down during slow wind speeds during the fall migration at night
7715579 we want to show people heres technology you have but dont use

7715593 it is so wonderful to be here and nothing was going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7715594 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
7715595 we are told that barack obama believes too much in an america of high principle and high endeavor
7715596 but when john kennedy thought of going to the moon he didnt say its too far to get there we shouldnt even try
7715597 today an american flag still marks the surface of the moon
7715598 each of us is a unique being needed as a voice in the symphony of life by not committing to our own wholeness we create holes in the universe appreciation of our sacred ground frees us of greed so that subtle energy and light can enter into us and nourish our unique gifts then the momentum of the universe is behind us for our purpose is aligned with the greater purpose of the cosmos we become one with the stream of creation an empowering participation that opens our sensitivities and draws forth our creativity
7715599 you may not be able to change society or save the planet but you can correct your own behavior so that you walk in an impeccable manner with respect for all living things
7715600 i think we have to work from wherever we are and seek with the best possible intent to reestablish whatever connections we can to know that we can feel the earth underneath our feet and the sky above us and that there are all kinds of beings around us and if we believe that it is possible to establish relations with them by opening ourselves to them they will also give of themselves to us we can start cultivating this in our lives through prayers through just intent
7715601 our essential nature is light we are all capable of developing a personal relationship with divinity and rediscovering our true perfection
7715602 it is very important to restore the broken relationship between human beings and the spirits those spirits that reside in trees grass water springs lakes even in the sky the clouds everything
7715603 if there is money involved its probably not spiritual we are all members of one human family and should help each other from a natural sense of kinship not a desire for personal gain
7715604 the maintenance of the earth is crucial to humanity rather than fighting with each other we should be concentrating on the earth looking after the earth because we all live on it thats where we all get our sustenance our home our food our everything comes from the earth and if the earth goes we go its as simple as that
7715605 of a certainty the person who can see all creatures in himself himself in all creatures knows no sorrow
7715606 the willingness to receive what is already in the core of your being is the willingness to not run from your own longing to discover right now within yourself the source of that longing then you will discover that the longing itself carries you to the core of yourself where true peace and perfection are revealed as never separate from the truth of who you are
7715607 in the end the secret to learning is so simple think only about whatever you love follow it do it dream about it and it will hit you learning was there all the time happening by itself
7715608 few parents have the courage and independence to care more for their childrens happiness than for their success
7715609 this politically motivated regulatory change deliberately confuses contraception that is birth control with abortion putting political agendas ahead of patients needs and jeopardizing american womens access to contraception lets be clear birth control is not abortion
7715610 birth control is not abortion it is basic womens health care women know this
7715611 for the bush administration to quietly try to redefine abortion to include birth control and use that change to threaten laws protecting women and rape survivors shows how completely out of touch republican leadership has become
7715612 its fun because you become a detective you go by what you think the book is versus what the customer thinks it is
7715613 hes just not that into you the no excuses truth to understanding guys
7715614 did you notice that in dracula versus frankenstein the makeup for frankenstein looks suspiciously like biscuit dough and that ray dennis steckler made the incredibly strange creatures that stopped living and became mixed up zombies in 1965 or 66
7715615 in the incredible mr limpet he fell in water and turned into a fish
7715616 barney was suave when he wasnt and tough when he wasnt hes one of the all time greats
7715617 in heaven everything is fine the unsolved life of peter ivers and the lost history of new wave theatre
7715618 i dont look at it as selling a customer a book usually you are learning from them they will tell you about a great book theyre reading and you just might pass along that idea to another customer customers actually force you to look at other stuff you might not consider
7715619 the chain stores look at trends we dont have to follow we were one of the first stores to have an event for texas writer rick riordan who writes childrens adventure based on greek mythology we have a blast when we do things like that we decide things on the fly and make events wilder and more fun weve hosted authors with fairly limited appeal even self published authors chains dont fool with that
7715620 he was funny and drew an interesting cross section of people from the strippers who wanted him to autograph their chests to the people who just didnt like him
7715621 im here to see joe lansdale author and hes kind of creepy
7715622 everyone thinks of joe torre as a new york yankee in my heart hell always be a st louis cardinal in 1971 he hit 0 363 splitting time as a catcher and third baseman
7715623 mommies got together to write about their children who would really read this except the grandparents
7715624 oh no shes just two and a half were observing today
7715625 well shes ready for kindergarten only shes not potty trained yet
7715626 when school is over i will be able to relax
7715627 the markets going to struggle until we get a clear indication that we know what the bottom is in the financials and that may be a while
7715628 false choice between liberties we cherish and security we demand
7715629 we democrats reject illegal wiretapping of american citizens we reject the use of national security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime
7715630 i am very proud to say that we reject torture
7715631 his physicians had been wary of the trip especially his exposure to crowds given the weakness of his immune system
7715632 cancer victims forced into debt to pay for medicines freely available elsewhere in europe
7715633 torn apart by internal bickering underscoring fears that the government would be distracted from its fight against islamic extremists
7715634 his physicians had been wary of the trip especially his exposure to crowds given the weakness of his immune system
7715635 for a stronger future in america despite his struggle against brain cancer
7715636 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the
7715637 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7715638 and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
7715639 i have come here tonight to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect president of the united states
7715640 as i look ahead i am strengthened by family and friendship
7715641 so many of you have been with me in the happiest days and the hardest days
7715642 together we have known success and seen failure victory and defeat
7715643 for me this is a season of hope new hope and this is the cause of my life new hope that we will break the old gridlock
7715644 has been a senator for all who believe that the dream has never died
7715645 two men who have changed my life and the life of this country
7715646 but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most this is one of those moments
7715647 section 329 by virtue of its objective of ensuring informational equality among voters is a reasonable limit on s 2 b of the charter
7715648 as an excessive response to an insufficiently proven harm in light of the implementation of staggered voting hours the publication ban in s 329 of the
7715649 for the purposes of s 6 3 b of the human rights act 1998 a function of a public nature includes a function performed pursuant to a contract or other arrangement with a public authority which is under a duty to perform the function
7715650 content to broad but previously undefined rights principles or norms
7715651 the action for recovery of taxes is firmly grounded as a public law remedy in a constitutional principle stemming from democracys earliest attempts to circumscribe governments power within the rule of law
7715652 and she won easily if we matched her against an elected executive presidency she would have another walkover
7715653 vote no this time because it goes too far and vote no next time because it doesnt go far enough
7715654 we still do not guarantee that the backorder will secure the domain because it is still possible for the original owner to renew the domain while it is in the grace period and also possible for the original owner to retrieve the domain from redemption however if the original owner does not try to retrieve the domain during the grace or redemption period then yes you would be guaranteed to secure the domain with the backorder as no other registrars would have access to the domain because it is still in our system
7715655 what an amazing entry this would be on my blog
7715656 a multiple of earnings that is comparable with jfcs previous acquisitions
7715657 the hongzhuangyuan business is quite profitable and has no debt
7715658 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table
7715659 with kara by her side paula finally has some back up and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7715660 i think simon is pretty spot on most of the time
7715661 im just somebody whos really honest and gives my opinion and if i feel the need to be hard with someone in order to get that across i will be and if i feel i need to be softer and more nurturing with some of the contestants ill be that
7715662 its not about vocal acrobatics its about being unique and doing things that are identifiable to you
7715663 what makes an artist is when their song comes on the radio i know exactly who it is
7715664 most probably crashed thats why we are concentrating our search within a 20 mile radius
7715665 unfortunately their aircraft was not able to land so we initiated search operations as early as that around 10 last night their aircraft is still missing up to now and were conducting search and rescue operations concentrating on the 20 mile radius around davao city international airport
7715666 were still verifying really as to what really transpired because this is something very unusual the aircraft and the pilots were all ok before take off and everything was normal until that time
7715667 most probably crashed thats why we are concentrating our search within a 20 mile radius
7715668 i feel strongly about the military and mccain represents the military my son is in the army and i believe that whatever the military goes for i think we should do and also i believe mccain will do more for the american economy he has the experience that mr barack obama doesnt have
7715669 theres a lot of things unknown about him kaya i dont know my vote later on
7715670 weve identified the democrat vice presidential candidate id like to hear what the republicans are going to show
7715671 finally theres somebody to talk to that who can speak about what it was like being a minority what it was like being raised in an asian household
7715672 what im really trying to tell voters filipino and asian pacific if they are reluctant because of the color issue then take it off the table dont even look at that issue go right to the political plan
7715673 yan ang advocacy ko ngayon sa pilipinas i have a political party development and campaign finance act na itinutulak ko para nga maging number one programmatic instead of personality oriented maging program oriented ang ating pulitika

7715676 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future and to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama
7715677 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7715678 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7715679 i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world
7715680 we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7715681 let there be no mistake about it we are united
7715682 hillary wants us to support obama the same we supported her and thats what we are gonna do
7715683 we need to look seriously at how to modernize our regulatory structure
7715684 what we have learned from the past two years is that the old form of regulation is broken
7715685 the exact form of the reform is something that we are learning about
7715686 before we go to the conclusion that the fed should be the single regulator i believe personally that there was a significant failure of regulation by the that was part of this crisis
7715687 there was no effort to take a rule we already have a regulation we already have to try to rein in the subprime market lending
7715688 the reason we werent terrorists is that we did not commit random acts of terror against people
7715689 they shouted get out get out at us repeatedly all 150 of us were rounded up for a short while before police arrived and talked them down to the ground floor
7715690 we will have to wait for the results of the police investigation to find out who these people are
7715691 if they break any law they will be dealt with accordingly
7715692 if it moves anywhere in north or central florida rains from gustav could make a pretty bad problem even worse
7715693 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards

7715698 nos preocupa que vayan impl citos acuerdos en cuestiones militares y pol ticas por declaraciones del mismo presidente ch vez en televisi n entendemos que es una alianza de los firmantes en contra de estados unidos

7715701 en t rminos comerciales las relaciones entre honduras y venezuela son muy discretas
7715702 la producci n agropecuaria hondure a es insuficiente para el propio pueblo as que los excedentes para vender en venezuela son muy limitados
7715703 en 2007 importamos mil millones de d lares en alimentos si no producimos para comer como le vamos a vender a venezuela
7715704 a la comunidad internacional le preocupa que nos est n financiando para promover el desarrollo y agarremos ese dinero para pagarle a ch vez su petr leo

7715707 wir diskutieren derzeit die frage dass alle bestehenden kernkraftwerke abgeschaltet werden sollen
7715708 da brauchen wir keine sondersteuer sondern es w re gar nicht schlecht wenn die kernkraftwerke berhaupt mal steuerpflichtig w ren
7715709 dann w rde es etwa bedeuten dass das letzte atomkraftwerk in deutschland bis 2049 laufen w rde
7715710 und dann kann man ungef hr rechnen dass das ein reingewinn von 250 milliarden bedeutet
7715711 dann frage ich mich warum wird dann nicht jetzt schon dieser nettogewinn zur ckgegeben
7715712 wir hatten vor etlichen jahren prognosen ber ganz stabile energiepreise in den n chsten jahrzehnten ich mahne nur an all diese prognosen bis 2020 oder 2021 bleiben alle preise stabil sind doch albern die kann doch in der heutigen welt kein mensch mehr halten

7715719 she got more votes than he obama did ive seen conventions where candidates with three or four thousand votes got nominated what is the problem
7715720 people are released with the idea that if they still feel the need to vote for her whether its emotionally philosophically that there would be no recrimination for doing so
7715721 maybe some questions like how do i make sure im showing support for barack obama at the same time acknowledging that sen clintons journey was historic as well you dont get to have two different votes
7715722 you cant help but feel like something important was taken away
7715723 people need to recognize the historic nature of what was accomplished it would be good to recognize that at this convention
7715724 we know that when we walk out of here after thursday night we are all going to be working to elect obama president it will be a totally unified group
7715725 and so my plea to you is lets get this family together and win this election this fall

7715776 sitting here in the real america that is ohio watching the democratic convention on a duraband tube purchased at a wal mart and having just suffered through the ted kennedy a palooza im just getting a sense of dread for the political process
7715777 the kennedy tribute was at best bizarre and at worst embarrassing
7715778 im just gonna speak to simon the way i speak to everybody
7715779 im just gonna have my opinion be honest and i dont foresee any problems im really excited about this and up for the challenge
7715780 its really flattering too you know to think that idol even thought about me
7715781 i mean when i got the call i thought they were calling the wrong person so im the and im hoping everyones gonna go easy on me and that i bring a lot to the table
7715782 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7715783 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7715784 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7715785 id say i believe in what i believe in and im willing to fight for it and im pretty feisty
7715786 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with and for you and me our country will be committed to his cause
7715787 the work will begin anew the hope will rise again and the dream lives on
7715788 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future and to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama
7715789 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7715790 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7715791 i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world
7715792 we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7715793 let there be no mistake about it we are united
7715794 hillary wants us to support obama the same we supported her and thats what we are gonna do
7715795 in a lot of ways he doesnt act like a rookie
7715796 im not going to be able to run like mike could
7715797 but there are a lot of things i think i do pretty well
7715798 that is the way everybody in this organization has approached it from the top down
7715799 we have some good veteran leadership here that keep it about the team its not about an individual its about us taking care of the things we need to take care of
7715800 i feel ive made some really good improvements i still have a long way to go
7715801 there are still some things that are certainly moving quickly in terms of recognizing coverages and different things like that
7715802 i have seen him do some things on the practice field that really surprise you
7715803 weve got five new players and i think were going to change the outlook of our team a little bit
7715804 i still think he has the fire i really do
7715805 its more of a time to be here than any just to show support for him and let him know that we care about him
7715806 all of these guys have calhouns voice in their head somewhere you know theres something he instilled in you that allows you to be who you are today
7715807 i would call home at 9 30 and hed be asleep
7715808 he would go home from work early which he never does he wanted to keep things normal but for the people who know him well it was obvious that he was running on fumes if theres anything i learned through this whole experience its that he is indeed as tough as i thought he was
7715809 they told me ive got about a month or month and a half to get myself back
7715810 it shouldnt have any effect on the season its something that happened its been taken care of taken care of very well and all reports are very good
7715811 he spoke about his cancer briefly and said he had to go through some difficult times he looks fine
7715812 he may still be a little weak but hes in good spirits thats just coach for you hes not going to let anything stand in his way or stop him its almost normal
7715813 its slower than id like it to be its not like all of a sudden the effects are gone the radiation does beat the hell out of you basically it just takes time
7715814 he handled it the way i thought he would in that he didnt let on to anybody that it was bothering him or that it was any kind of inconvenience
7715815 he came in to the office every day he never wants to give in to anything thats the great thing about him
7715816 this probably isnt funny but weve been fooling around with it saying calhoun 3 cancer 0 and its not a fair fight
7715817 i dont want to be the guy with the most victories in the graveyard the guy with the most money in the graveyard i just dont want to be in the graveyard eventually like everyone else my time will come but the way i feel about my family and the way i feel about my life the way i feel about a lot of things that i can still do and the joy i get out of living im not willing to give any of that up
7715818 if you get past one year youre in good shape
7715819 if you get past two youre in great shape get past three and basically youre done with this kind of thing there is an unknown but we all have unknowns
7715820 has shown dedication and devotion to the american cancer societys fight
7715821 hes the kind of guy that who if he cant exercise he doesnt do well psychologically
7715822 im a private person and when we were first dealing with this i didnt want jim to go public
7715823 but if just one person listened and is helped by this then it makes it worthwhile
7715824 because i didnt really know what i was dealing with
7715825 there have been many instances where the staff turned down an appeal and the reinstatement committee reversed it
7715826 while we would have appreciated a staff ruling that would have put him on the field tomorrow we are grateful for the opportunity to be heard on thursday
7715827 they told us that theyd get us a prompt ruling
7715828 what prompt means im not exactly sure they have done what theyve told us theyve been looking at it promptly while ben and i would have hoped for a better ruling from the staff were confident well get a fair and good hearing from the committee
7715829 oh yes this is one of those bits im supposed to find brilliant isnt it
7715830 we do not know why this person was intent on gaining access to this restricted area
7715831 some witnesses have stated that the individual was trying to retrieve something he had lost
7715832 others reported that he was trying to touch the ride this is merely speculation at this point and we are working with park visitors and local police to learn more
7715833 all indications are that the park had done everything they could to maintain a safe environment
7715834 will threatening to kick them out of the g8 keep them
7715835 i saw him throw his finger toward the showers and i thought what are you talking about
7715836 youre going to throw me out and the games already over youre cool
7715837 he doesnt need help hes got 49 saves he doesnt need help getting 50
7715838 i told him you dont want to get in a situation where you throw your helmet down what if he throws it and it flies up and hits someone
7715839 then youve got something serious let me do the umpires thing
7715840 the democratic convention now teeters on the brink of a media disaster thanks to real news that threatens to distract reporters from the scripted show and wouldnt you know its all about the clintons whatever the cause the appearance of clinton getting dissed by obama opened pandoras box for her enthusiasts
7715841 nick diaz will be back in november on showtime for an elite show
7715842 today is the peoples revolution day so we want nbt to stop broadcasting
7715843 they shouted get out get out at us repeatedly all 150 of us were rounded up for a short while before police arrived and talked them down to the ground floor
7715844 traiesc aici izolat si abandonat de toata lumea nimeni nu stie ca mai exist

7715846 we want to change burnout this year big time and we want to do it through downloadable packs
7715847 it has been widely proclaimed that criterion are sony fanboys having lead development on that system even most recently with burnout paradise
7715848 however that being said the game and all updates are the exact same game on both platforms
7715849 an important reason for the crackdown is the olympics this year chinese leaders face more pressure from outside groups house churches and even ordinary individual citizens
7715850 has been marred by a well documented surge in violations of the rights of free expression and association as well as media freedom
7715851 were properly addressed by relevant authorities or departments through consultations

7715888 its not been glamorous the people in the community have been great i love what im doing and i love where im doing it
7715889 i dont spend time talking about people who dont play for michigan
7715890 its so far fetched that its not even worth talking about were extremely close extremely close as a team
7715891 apostles is a group of leaders from every class serves that serves as the voice for the team
7715892 hes not a coach thats going to pat you on your back too much
7715893 hes going to get in your face because he demands greatness from us thats what we need
7715894 those concussions youve got to go slow with those they say rest is the best thing
7715895 if we can get some good work in those 10 days the guys have enough experience and have worked together for last year that theyll be able to jell
7715896 im so psyched about it we are shooting monday tuesday and thursday this week and its really cool
7715897 they liked it so much they are bringing us back for some encore time to beef it up
7715898 we actually just had a rehearsal at director catherine hardwickes house the other day for a new scene
7715899 i know theyve been showing it to some people and some people go i want to see a little more of this or i dont quite understand this
7715900 i wouldnt be walking tomorrow if i spilled those beans but im psyched especially about the wardrobe
7715901 it gives us a little bit of history of the cullen family they are just shooting a couple of different added scenes and the scene im in i can tell you its me and robert pattinson rosalie and emmett are in that scene
7715902 well i am going to be in the prom scene now at the very end of the film
7715903 at first we didnt film that and now some people are saying they want to see a bit more of jacob and they want him in the prom scene at the end
7715904 i was only a 17 year old kid and didnt know what to think
7715905 my main objective was to get back on the mound
7715906 i really had the stuff to be in the big leagues
7715907 but i had to get over the mental part of the game learning how to pitch and do it efficiently
7715908 when i got to the big leagues it was one of the best days of my life i worked so hard
7715909 the first time was probably the most weird i thought i had moved myself up the ranks in the texas organization and thought i had a future there
7715910 i wasnt expecting to get traded again the year ken griffey jr was a rookie was the year i started collecting baseball cards i think its a really big statement being traded for a hall of famer
7715911 it left me with no strength no endurance no nothing
7715912 i feel like im in the best physical shape ive ever been in
7715913 he was determined to give her something he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
7715914 the fact that barack obama chose to launch his political career at the home of an unrepentant terrorist raises more questions about senator obamas judgment than any tv ad ever could and the fact that hes launching his own convention by defending his long association with a man who says he didnt bomb enough u s targets tells us more about barack obama than any of tonights speeches will
7715915 a knowing and willful attempt to violate the strictures of federal election law
7715916 an investigation of the american issues project its officers and directors and its anonymous donors whoever they may be
7715917 this is a sad ploy to circumvent the first amendment by a campaign who has no arguments with the merits of our ad its the classic maneuver if you cant win on the merits file a lawsuit
7715918 at a cost fruit juices were poured chants intoned eggs broken on her body but the curse hung on and the costs kept on
7715919 given huntingtons advice the navys existing plan the operational considerations the maritime strategy and 35 sic billion over 5 years what would be your shipbuilding plan and why the fy09 fy13 plan the navy released in this budget year can be found here for comparison remember we are talking about 5 years from fy10 fy14 here but it should be part of a larger strategy
7715920 shes got an agenda and come hell or high water shes going to get that agenda through and thats tragic
7715921 she had to reject lots of traditional principles to get to the place she got in this opinion
7715922 if the parties constrain the arbitrators authority by requiring a dispute to be decided according to the rule of law and make plain their intention that the award is reviewable for legal error
7715923 the general rule of limited review has been displaced by the parties agreement their expectation is not that the result of the arbitration will be final and conclusive but rather that it will be reviewed on the merits at the request of either party
7715924 by flipping a coin or studying the entrails of a dead fowl
7715925 more searching review based on authority outside the federal statute
7715926 had the u s supreme court meant to impose a uniform national policy requiring judicial review solely on the grounds stated in the faa
7715927 it would not have left open the possibility of trial court review under
7715928 the majority decision would allow parties to fundamentally refashion arbitration from being a means of binding dispute resolution to being essentially a preliminary fact finding procedure with trial and appellate courts required to settle decisive legal questions
7715929 the majority believes this change to be for the good whether or not this is so is open to question arguably this rule will burden the courts with the minutiae of arbitration disputes thereby negating whatever benefits arbitration may have had in conserving judicial resources
7715930 it allows parties to be certain that the california courts will enforce their agreed upon rules of arbitration
7715931 its neutral it is equally protective of plaintiffs and defendants

7715934 this skit that some of the teachers did it was pretty funny
7715935 i like how the chapel is in the middle of the school and its the first thing you see
7715936 i feel like i have a chance to grow here
7715937 this was the best first of school ive ever had
7715938 what a historic event to have a mother and daughter honored in this special way
7715939 its such an honor to be alive and to be celebrating this with all of you
7715940 the gym is very big i like that because i like to run around
7715941 though it isnt grammatically correct you aint seen nothing yet
7715942 despite the fact that most of the additional one million people projected to live in northern virginia in the next 25 years are projected to live outside the capital beltway
7715943 the commonwealth of virginia and northern virginia transportation authority continue to ignore the need for bridges and other investments that studies have long confirmed do the most to improve mobility reduce congestion and provide a structure around which to use land more intelligently
7715944 from july 1 2006 to july 1 2007 loudoun and prince william counties added almost twice as many people as all other northern virginia jurisdictions of arlington alexandria fairfax county fairfax city falls church manassas and manassas park combined
7715945 it taught me a lot of skills and attributes to better myself
7715946 thats always been a fear of mine but since ive been there speaking in front of my peers and stuff has been much easier
7715947 once school starts rather than doing chore work shed rather do homework
7715948 the sentence will never be enough but hell pay one day
7715949 theres someone higher hell have to answer to well get our justice that day
7715950 he was only getting about 9 an hour but he was making it work
7715951 ive never had someone inspire me the way people tell me my father inspired them but
7715952 never missed a first communion a graduation or a chance to walk a niece down the aisle
7715953 close the door on the old politics of race gender and straight against gay
7715954 we have scaled the heights i know it ive seen it ive lived it and we can do it again
7715955 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7715956 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
7715957 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7715958 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7715959 the questions posed to mr bonds by two different prosecutors at his grand jury appearance were imprecise redundant overlapping and frequently compound
7715960 this is an exciting event not only will we be able to crown our long course triathlon national championships but we will also be crowning our club national champions
7715961 athletes of all experience levels will have the opportunity to contribute to their clubs scoring whether it be the sprint intermediate or long course distance event clubs will be able to bring athletes of all experience levels to compete
7715962 we are excited to be working with the redman triathlon group
7715963 with their good reputation and completion of usats race director certification course we are confident that athletes will experience a top notch event
7715964 they wanted to enter europe in a big way and probably this is the reason why they have paid a higher premium
7715965 its a positive sign for the company because they were sitting on a huge cash pile and it was not generating any return

7715968 un segundo en la regata de entreno es un buen modo de comenzar la semana no conoc amos el campo de regatas pero apostamos por el lado izquierdo el equipo quiere ganar esta regata y eso me exigir mucho fueron segundos en la breitling yahra quieren mejorarlo por lo que s lo cabe ganar es mucha presi n pero me gusta y estoy seguro que la tripulaci n y el barco son capaces de lograrlo haremos todo lo posible para lograr nuestro objetivo
7715969 en la salida nos ha sobrado menos de una eslora y no hemos regresado correctamente luego hemos regateado muy bien remontando paulatinamente en los cuatro tramos del recorrido ha sido un buen entrenamiento
7715970 nuestra estrategia en el trofeo regi n de murcia es mirar adelante pensar en reducir la diferencia con los dos primeros para mejorar nuestra actual tercera plaza a final de temporada
7715971 since im sitting here 1 2 naked in a gown this is the perfect time to lotion up
7715972 managers are expendable i believe there should be relief managers just like charlie grimm
7715973 but when i really think back i can also see how the person she is today was formed in the experiences we shared growing up working hard studying hard having parents who wanted more for us than what they had and always being reminded that in this country of all countries those things were possible
7715974 we lost my father in 1991 and i know hes looking down on us tonight so proud of his daughter not because of who she married though he was a big fan of barack but because of the hard working brilliant woman she is what shes accomplished in her own right the mother shes become and the values shes instilled in her daughters
7715975 she has continued to follow that passion she gave up a job in a big law firm to work in her community with a group called public allies she trained a new generation of community leaders she developed the university of chicagos community service center connecting the university to the neighborhood that was blocks away but often worlds away from its gates
7715976 my sister had grown up hearing my father and me talk about how to judge a persons character by what type of sportsman they are so she asked me to take barack to play basketball if youre looking for a political analysis based on his playing here it is hes confident but not cocky hell take the shot if hes open hes a team player who improves the people around him and he wont back down from any challenge together ive watched barack and michelle strengthen each other ive watched them create a home filled with love and grounded in faith during challenging times ive watched michelle and barack stand by each other and i know theyll stand by you the american people now and in the future
7715977 mike im not here to talk to you about my plans im here to listen to you
7715978 theres no hard feelings its just bad business business is business
7715979 i love diane hewes to death i hope to do something with gcw in the future i just cant do business like that
7715980 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7715981 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7715982 i know this is not coming from barack obama but his supporters are helping us decide who to vote for
7715983 i hate the feeling that you shouldnt wear your hillary gear unless there are two or three of you together
7715984 i cant imagine not going into a convention and hearing alabama and the whole world looking up to see what comes next
7715985 but as typical of these roll calls at a certain point somebody has the votes and the protocol and graciousness come through and that will have its own dynamic
7715986 the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans
7715987 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7715988 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7715989 and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
7715990 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7715991 as i look ahead i am strengthened by family and friendship
7715992 so many of you have been with me in the happiest days and the hardest days together we have known success and seen setbacks victory and defeat
7715993 but we have never lost our belief that we are all called to a better country and a newer world
7715994 and i pledge to you i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate when we begin the great test
7715995 has been a senator for all who believe that the dream has never died
7715996 two men who have changed my life and the life of this country
7715997 but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most this is one of those moments
7715998 the theory behind the design was to try to bring the american people into the process
7715999 but its an interesting question whether dazzling is what the obama campaign needs right now
7716000 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7716001 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7716002 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1

7716058 you wont have to look too hard to find us in the twin cities
7716059 the republicans can set up as many war rooms as sen mccain has houses but that wont change the fact that john mccain voted with george bush 95 of the time last year and offers just more of the same failed economic policies

7716192 sure these motivational speakers will say set your goals but they wouldnt then tell you how to find the people to help you achieve your goals and if they did it was a very difficult process the innovations around pathconnect are really around someone stating their intent and meeting another person in the community with a similar intent or having achieved something similar to learn from the phenomenon of the secret and the book and the movie are so massively phenomenal because society wants that message and i believe pathconnect can not only give that message but it can give you a tool at the same time
7716193 the fascination with signing up with a system of entrepreneurship or getting into some deal or real estate agent or whatever just to become rich i mean people are selling shortcuts to success
7716194 the lottery frickin america itself is selling a shortcut to success buy a lottery ticket and you can be a millionaire it pisses me off so much so for me i always say that there are no shortcuts to success there is nothing you get to keep that comes easy i never won the lottery my success has been work ethic and discipline and thats what i tell people
7716195 there are a lot of factors that come into play
7716196 they dont have to adhere to the same truth in advertising laws as other companies first of all but if you like the product and you can get in early enough and if you have a wide enough set of contacts and youve got sales skills to be really successful you can build it into a very lucrative business
7716197 if you can develop five levels beneath you in amway youre probably working in the brazilian rainforest
7716198 because almost everybody who wants to be in amway has been exposed to it so in order to do well in mlm you have to be an initial person who helps establish the initial chain
7716199 the advantage of mlm is that it doesnt require anywhere near the amount of money to get started the advertising your promotion your initial people are just your friends and people you run into and your ability to motivate them
7716200 if you really want to set up a company and market it normally then youre talking about a sales force youre talking about warehousing and thats a lot harder more expensive
7716201 two decades of nih national institute of health funded research and formulated by one of the top 1 percent of medical doctors in the nation
7716202 to get fda approval you have to do those kinds of big huge massive experiments and epidemiological studies which are basically natural experiments and it takes millions of dollars and a staff of people and a team of statisticians and years to do and thats the only way to test it
7716203 so no one does it its time consuming its expensive its hard to do its hard to get the data and so its much easier to just rattle off anecdotes hey this guy did it and he said his tumor went away or his gray hair disappeared or whatever and because humans are naturally anecdotal thinkers those anecdotes are our folkways of adapting and thinking about the world so we just fall for it every time
7716204 next on oprah you know look at this person who tried this and look how good their life turned out
7716205 and no one ever asks well how about the counter examples what about the people who tried it and their lives didnt work out or what about the people who didnt try any of that and their lives turned out great and of course that would be the scientific way of thinking and of course that doesnt come natural
7716206 if the mlm in question says you have to buy products then theyre in violation
7716207 to try our product is really the first way to get involved
7716208 and our least expensive products are in the 20 to 30 range and our energy drink is going to be 39 for a box so there are definitely some financial entry points
7716209 if you actually want to start selling whats required then
7716210 if you want to enroll in the company as a distributor then you can fill out an application and the deal is that the upfront cost would be 39 for your business guide for the company theres no high up front kit charges if you want to be a distributor for commissions and bonuses
7716211 ok so if you pay the 39 then you can go to someone else and say okay you can buy this product you can sell it like crazy and they can buy it from you and they can be involved in your multilevel marketing
7716212 the real requirements to success is work ethic coachability and sheer desire
7716213 from a company standpoint theres either an entry of 40 or an entry of 500
7716214 its a 500 entry fee thats 100 percent refundable and youre getting 250 in product to go out and give samples youre given web systems web sites marketing materials but the reason i make the distinction is because there are companies out there that say hey go out there and invest 100 000 to get started and thats what gave network marketing a bad name
7716215 i wonder what was going on in sarah winchesters mind
7716216 the vp message was sent in the late hours of friday night and is by many accounts the single largest in the u s to date
7716217 while much has been said of the timing and the scoop by news outlets obamas v p text message still ranks as one of the most important text messages even sent and one of the most successful brand engagements using mobile media
7716218 we need your help obama bin ladin has just nominated his running mate as joe biden but we dont have one picked out for mccain are you up for the challenge
7716219 how long exactly is the gestation time of a pregnant pause
7716220 uh barterman this is the republican party calling you really should ask the dizzycrats that question maybe gore would know he probably invented it so what do you say
7716221 exactly they wont know whats hit em so its a deal then good besides youre the only person we could find at such short notice that would make john look younger
7716222 glad you could make it my boy john mccain the pleasure is all yours

7716227 and thus the vampire raises his goblet of blood and slowly took a drink his bright red eyes stared into yours a hyptnotic gaze one has only read about slowly he sets the goblet down licking the blood of his sparkling white fangs and pale maw
7716228 the vp message was sent in the late hours of friday night and is by many accounts the single largest mobile marketing event in the u s to date
7716229 while much has been said of the timing and the scoop by news outlets obamas v p text message still ranks as one of the most important text messages even sent and one of the most successful brand engagements using mobile media
7716230 theres been some studies apparently by previous governments of this i havent seen them which has said it may not work
7716231 but we want to have another look at it because its a positive constructive idea lets see if it works
7716232 when it comes to sports funding its not either or either community sport or elite sport well be doing both
7716233 the kids who are engaging in community sport a lot of them want to have the hope in their eyes that they can rise to elite representational levels as well

7716241 the shared library limewire is not compatible with this version of itunes
7716242 i all ready tried chaining the icon picture and that did nothing
7716243 i said that in the media to put some context around it
7716244 i was asked a question would it have been leaked from my department and i said no because it was actually written in my office so clearly it was leaked not from my department
7716245 one of the most successful police ministers this state has had for decades
7716246 there is somebody obviously who has access to that letter who thinks its pretty scintillating
7716247 im not sure who it was and frankly i dont care much because our government believes in getting on with the job
7716248 a real estate agent might describe it as having some rustic charm
7716249 my daughter did this to me because i hurt the mother
7716250 i have to pray five times a day for what i have done

7716255 i truly believe that peter has incredible economic credentials and its not for peter its for our nation that he should be on the frontbench
7716256 but if he doesnt have an intention that way he should declare it as such so that we dont hold up a false hope that he may come back because it makes a bit of a fool of me and a few others as well
7716257 malcolm is an outstanding contributor but weve got a leader and i think hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances he said
7716258 the last thing we want to do is develop a tradition of knifing our leaders
7716259 peter costello will make up his mind in due course but i must say peter costello said at the time of the last election that it was his intention to move into a life after politics and i took him at his word
7716260 my presumption is that he will indeed be leaving politics but he will make his position clear i suspect in the next two or three weeks
7716261 shes the best stepmom sam lola and cassandra could ever hope for seeing her love and affection with those three i know shell be an amazing mom unless i bat 100 percent perhaps a boy awaits us
7716262 brooke found out for sure on friday and is thrilled to death

7716264 britney spears will not be performing at the vmas this year im telling you officially and unequivocally
7716265 is in the middle of recording her next album which is going amazingly well and was never supposed to perform at that show
7716266 tons of people might be contenders right down to the last week thats what people want lots of competition and unpredictable things happening
7716267 we thought wed focus on good characters and lots of things could happen its a show that makes itself in some ways
7716268 yes i can confirm im pregnant its still early so im being cautious im resting as much as possible
7716269 ive moved down to the beach with tito i love being by the beach
7716270 were trying for a baby so hopefully in the next couple of months
7716271 i think im gonna stay unmarried and just go for the babies
7716272 maybe ana lucia busted l a based ghost hustler miles during her pre crash lapd days and now the freighter folkster is seeing visions of the late tailie on the island
7716273 this hint needs to be updated to include what needs to be done if one has been using the time capsule for tm backups and the mac being backed up undergoes repairs such that its mac address changes the tm backup structure on the time capsules internal hdd is different from that on a tm backup disk that is directly attached to the mac the original hint address only the case for the direct attached tm backup disk the tm backup on the time capsule is a sparse bundle disk image and few more things have to be taken into account ive gone thru this and successfully dealt with a mac address change but need to formalise my notes before posting what i did if someone beats me to it then be my guest thanks regards barry sharp

7716279 father joes blog is great fun to read too bad i will have to strike him dead with lightning some day
7716280 right after evening prayer i regularly read his blog and note corrections for my upcoming encyclicals
7716281 before i have my security council meeting each morning i check to see whats new at fr joes blog
7716282 this infidel priest is not funny and is ill informed
7716283 he is a right wing bigot who is anti choice and anti woman the goddess is not happy with his blog
7716284 he is the poorest priest i know always pontificating about things he knows nothing about he is a disgrace
7716285 the invasion is going as planned and soon all the clergy will be pod people from outer space starting with father joe
7716286 never have i met someone who was so opposed to true ecumenism and religious freedom i would like to sacrifice him in my dinner pot and wear his head as an ornament voices like his need to be silenced we should all pray and sup together
7716287 the exports trend has eased in recent months following a period of strong growth in the second half of 2007
7716288 the imports trend has increased strongly since the middle of 2007 coinciding with a significant rise in fuel prices
7716289 number one they need to import a large amount of wheat
7716290 if they need wheat right now the us is the place to go
7716291 the idea of that in 2000 was to promote certain types of exports to sanctioned countries so there would be food medicine agricultural products medical products
7716292 it is still surprising that they are buying wheat from the us instead of waiting to buy wheat from someone else
7716293 maybe the relationship between iran and the us is not as terrible as it has been
7716294 iran is more interested in showing to its people that it is not restrained by sanctions
7716295 the real signal is look were doing fine we can buy wheat from the us
7716296 this is a serious setback for iran from a domestic point of view because they made a big deal about self sufficiency in grains
7716297 this new business model will not only enable ornge to contain the escalating costs associated with medical transports while replacing the current aging fleet but more importantly it will also enable more patients to be transported while receiving the highest level of medical care they deserve
7716298 the recent purchase of aircraft by ornge combined with the competitive bidding process will result in a new business model for the eventual rotary wing service provider
7716299 nos encontramos en medio de una dif cil campa a presidencial tengo a un oponente muy honorable hay fuertes diferencias entre nosotros
7716300 yo s que tienen estudiantes que vienen de todo el mundo s que hay personas que vienen de varias naciones algunas de ellas desde irak donde han visto c mo es la guerra y el sacrificio
7716301 creo en sus ideales y propuestas el mccain ha sido un luchador por la comunidad hispana ha sido un palad n de los temas migratorios
7716302 no nos llevaremos su dinero y nos iremos competiremos en california
7716303 he hablado con la campa a de mccain un poco acerca del tema pero ciertamente no de estar en esa mezcla los posibles candidatos
7716304 el trabajo inicia de nuevo la esperanza vuelve a surgir y el sue o contin a
7716305 nadie tiene dudas de que esta es la convenci n de barack obama
7716306 se sienten obligados con las personas que los enviaron aqu y que los eligieron para representarlas
7716307 que sea cual fuere la persona por la que decidan votar estaremos todos unidos tras el senador obama
7716308 city officials falsified costs of the anniversary photo display by claiming volunteers built easels
7716309 instead a single contractor pocketed over 23 000 for building easels
7716310 volunteers did build some of the easels when poor weather and time constraints prevented the volunteers for building all of the easels in time for the citys 20th anniversary observance a contractor was hired by the city and was paid 16 502 50 to build the remaining easels
7716311 will be out in force during the labor day weekend and will be aggressively enforcing traffic laws
7716312 seatbelts have been proven time and again to save lives in motor vehicle collisions
7716313 has a tremendous impact on the driver that they may not consider
7716314 expect heavy traffic and adjust your routes and travel times accordingly
7716315 the newnan police department intends to do everything in our abilities to insure there are no fatalities during the labor day weekend
7716316 we ask that everyone use their seatbelts slow down and be patient we hope everyone has a safe and enjoyable holiday weekend
7716317 our highway safety data shows speed impaired driving and unrestrained driving are still the top three causes of fatal crashes not just during the summer holidays but throughout the year
7716318 your cars fuel efficiency begins to rapidly decrease at speeds over 60 mph
7716319 your own lead foot can lower your gas mileage by 5 percent around town and as much as 33 percent at highway speeds
7716320 for all those high risk drivers who dont seem to care if speed is a killer on our roads maybe it matters if its murder on their wallets
7716321 because of questions on whether we could continue to use it for an educational facility
7716322 they asked us to do something we may or may not be able to do
7716323 i dont want to take the building and not be able to fill the stipulation of course
7716324 i dont think the board got into any specific definition of education facility
7716325 theres a lot of things that go into education but there werent any specific things cited
7716326 based on the two stipulations instead of the one which is the way we felt we were receiving the property
7716327 system would encourage the city to use the building as some kind of educational and or recreational facility
7716328 i dont think we should tell them how to use it however i do want the howard warner name on it i do think based on the history with mr warner and all the things he did for the community i wouldnt want to take his name away from that but i dont think it was our business to try and determine what they want to use it for my own personal opinion is it was a gift and theyre smart enough to figure out what they want to use it for and what they can use it for
7716329 youre just more or less their parents for the year mainly youre just there for them to guide them through the year
7716330 if it wasnt for him we wouldnt have known about it
7716331 the most american thing close by was a police car parked outside of a dunkin donuts
7716332 you never hear anything about georgia its always l a or new york
7716333 you have to see three plays and i cant sit in a theater and see another play you have to read hamlet and i had to read hamlet once and i didnt like it then
7716334 its different than back home we play a lot more aggressively
7716335 i stepped on someones foot and i didnt even apologize
7716336 it was the most american thing weve done so far
7716337 when they opened the airport door it felt like a sauna
7716338 people take giant mugs of coffee and just drive away while talking on their cell phones
7716339 to meet mates and go to a pub and have a drink
7716340 they all waited to come over here to buy our laptops
7716341 he told me i feel like a kid at christmas
7716342 but it was a great reminder of how important it was to remember our training we all learned a big lesson that day
7716343 i didnt want to be the only young man left back at home
7716344 but the worst thing was when they put me in the hospital i was afraid i wouldnt be able to stay with my training group and i didnt really want that
7716345 there was gunfire all the time and it was always hard to sleep
7716346 it got scary at times but luckily i was never hurt
7716347 it was frustrating sitting there day after day and hearing the action up in the hills and not being part of it
7716348 thats what wed all trained for and then we traveled all the way over there and couldnt fight it got to you
7716349 being up there and seeing everything like that was just great
7716350 i knew it had been taken by somebody who knew the gun was in my bag
7716351 there couldnt have been a better song for that time and place
7716352 go undercover with a license to shake what your mama gave you with our new double o collection the oo brief provides maximum push up effect with minimum booty coverage
7716353 if you have drainage issues keep those areas clear if you see water turn around it doesnt take much water to carry or lift a car away
7716354 but it being in a tropical state to begin with that means a lot of rain with it
7716355 basically as it continues to move northeast it will pull moisture with it and it should be out of georgia by wednesday night or thursday morning
7716356 but another issue we have since fay will be coming through is it will leave a lot of good moisture over us which means during the daytime well still have showers and thunderstorms through the rest of the week and through the weekend
7716357 media companies fit for the modern media world need to be lean and agile chief executive david kirk said in a statement
7716358 this far reaching program will position us well for the next stage of our growth and development
7716359 over the course of the 2006 and 2007 financial years we achieved 52 million in ongoing real cost reductions he said
7716360 cost synergies associated with the merger of fairfax media and rural press and the acquisition of southern cross radio produced a further 53 million in savings
7716361 all of these synergies will be realised by the end of this financial year
7716362 migrant workers can bring enormous benefits to local businesses and areas however many of these contributions such as new ideas and ways of working and an entrepreneurial spirit may have been neglected in the past
7716363 to get the most out of migration local communities alongside local leaders businesses universities and central government need to recognise the variety of benefits that migrants can bring and plan accordingly
7716364 with the economic situation worsening and the property market still suffering we are calling on the government to take urgent action on hips we have long seen hips as not fit for purpose and as the wrong answer to simplifying the house buying process quite simply the government tried to force square pegs into round holes and the slower property market is making this situation worse
7716365 hips are already bringing benefits to consumers by providing important information to help families cut their fuel bills and carbon emissions and have reduced the price of property searches by increasing transparency in the home buying and selling process
7716366 pranks like this are so puny theres really nothing gutsy about jumping out of your car and stealing a sign out of a yard its really pretty pitiful but the repercussions are that someone has to go out and buy another one
7716367 the approach theyre taking seems to me little more than petty bullying
7716368 they have little to no legitimate legal claim and are presumably relying on my being a small developer with insufficient resources to defend myself
7716369 the lack of protection for the idea of a game is troubling in that it promotes quick ripoffs of a concept that someone somewhere spent a lot of effort on
7716370 when i have the time and can find a good copyright lawyer ill be figuring out exactly what my position is and how i can make tris available again
7716371 would write for the sake of writing blah blah i have all this angst to spew out into the world
7716372 would write for the sake of writing blah blah i have all this angst to spew out into the world
7716373 today is the peoples revolution day so we want nbt to stop broadcasting
7716374 they shouted get out get out at us repeatedly all 150 of us were rounded up for a short while before police arrived and talked them down to the ground floor
7716375 we will have to wait for the results of the police investigation to find out who these people are
7716376 if they break any law they will be dealt with accordingly

7716386 i needed a single word i could define a large group of pe adam you can send on over my way here in pa
7716387 the way they planned it was tonight was supposed to be sort of the personal michelle obama will talk about barack obama personally ted kennedy was a very personal emotional speech
7716388 but i guarantee on the first night of the republican convention youre going to hear talk about barack obama commander in chief tax cuts et cetera et cetera
7716389 bringing the party together and giving it energy not seen since bill clinton left the governors mansion for the white house in 1992
7716390 at the time of his death the party was in the midst of expanding its reach into even solidly conservative portions of the state in an aug 5 e mail newsletter gwatney wrote that the party planned to add headquarters in sebastian pope washington and benton counties
7716391 we got almost the entire arkansas delegation to say they would sign the petition we had sent out the petitions to everyone but since his death they got so distracted that we have not received all of them back i can tell you that all the other state party chairs in the states are fully run by obama and they would not even return our phone calls and were against anything to do with our petition
7716392 i never heard him discuss any derogatory statements about anyone anywhere any time he was one of those people that would blend into the background
7716393 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
7716394 theyre old keys they probably dont go to anything anymore
7716395 best that we leave the stuff requiring expert medical knowledge to the experts
7716396 looks like the demented are sane enough to have identified a new place to safely assault unarmed victims local democratic party offices
7716397 make a list of what you were grateful for in bill gwatneys life
7716398 he was a better golfer than i was i am not grateful for that but he seemed to genuinely like it if i hit a good shot which is a sign of grace
7716399 but if god so clothes the grass of the field which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace will he not much more clothe you

7716401 let us not give up meeting together as some are in the habit of doing but let us encourage one another
7716402 you will know the truth and the truth will set you free
7716403 i tell you the truth no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age homes brothers sisters mothers children and fields and with them persecutions and in the age to come eternal life
7716404 come to me all you who are weary and burdened and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn from me for i am gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light
7716405 you know that the rulers of the gentiles lord it over them and their high officials exercise authority over them
7716406 japanese soldiers in the south pacific still fighting after the war is over
7716407 and he has not demonstrated that he accepts the clintons and the clinton wing of the party
7716408 that puts him in a terrible bind because you cant give a ringing endorsement when youre talking about foreign policy
7716409 obviously the hard thing to talk about with obama is commander in chief of all his many talents
7716410 you dont rah rah about commander in chief you rah rah about hope and change and a new party and all that so no matter what he does somebody will find fault with it
7716411 we polked you in 44 we shall pierce you in 52

7716660 the intersection of invention and insight leading to the creation of social and economic value
7716661 the development of new ideas and their economic application as new products or processes
7716662 though the outcomes of successful innovations appear random the processes that result in their success often are not
7716663 he who innovates will have for his enemies all those who are well off under the existing order of things and only lukewarm supporters in those who might be better off under the new
7716664 the true pacemakers of socialism were not the intellectuals or agitators who preached it but the vanderbilts carnegies and rockefellers

7716667 we are all faced with a series of great opportunities brilliantly disguised as impossible situations
7716668 god allows us to experience the low points in life in order to teach us lessons we could not learn in any other way the way we learn those lessons is not to deny the feelings but to find the meanings underlying them
7716669 the purpose of life is not to be happy it is to be useful to be honorable to be compassionate to have it make some difference that you lived and lived well
7716670 be what you are this is the first step to becoming better than you are
7716671 difficulty need not foreshadow despair or defeat rather achievement can be all the more satisfying because of obstacles surmounted
7716672 for most people obama is the tax cutter in this campaign
7716673 the obama plan would cut taxes for 95 of workers and their families with a tax cut of 500 for workers or 1 000 for working couples
7716674 tax cuts for low and middle income seniors homeowners the uninsured and families sending a child to college or looking to save and accumulate wealth
7716675 senator obamas proposed tax cuts for the middle class are actually marginal rate hikes in disguise
7716676 a staggering 45 effective marginal rate 11 percentage points higher than under current law
7716677 i filed this action at this time to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
7716678 steers patients who dont have private insurance primarily poor black people to other health care facilities
7716679 the medical professionals who have come to me are accusing the university of dumping patients on its neighboring institutions
7716680 but may all who search for you be filled with joy and gladness
7716681 as for me i am poor and needy but the lord is thinking about me right now you are my helper and my savior do not delay o my god
7716682 the rich and the poor have this in common the lord made them both
7716683 listen carefully to my speech and let this be your consolation
7716684 for they shall soon be cut down like the grass and wither as the green herb
7716685 even at this early stage of ministry he already showed signs of becoming a noted author the deeper christian life was a favorite subject for murray he told how god was committed to revealing more of himself to those who would seek him
7716686 as a preacher he consistently drew large crowds and led many to trust christ as their savior
7716687 count it one of the chief blessings of prayer to exercise faith in god as the living mighty god who waits to fulfil in us all the good pleasure of his will and the work of faith with power
7716688 see in him the god of love whose delight it is to bless and impart himself
7716689 let such as love your salvation say continually the lord be magnified
7716690 but i am poor and needy yet the lord thinks upon me
7716691 abba father all things are possible unto thee take away this cup from me nevertheless not what i will but what thou wilt mark 14 36 kjv
7716692 how can you comfort me all your explanations are wrong
7716693 then he said i beg you therefore father that you would send him to my fathers house
7716694 as the father loved me i also have loved you abide in my love
7716695 these things i have spoken to you that my joy may remain in you and that your joy may be full
7716696 the police had formed a club swinging gauntlet along the curb every four or five feet there was a billy club wielding cop wailing away we were beaten from one cop to the next to the next
7716697 the way to really show we are serious about providing products to them that are useful is through software
7716698 from what i gathered it made it easier for people to find their pictures and just various programs they installed and common things they used i have no problems doing that
7716699 on top of windows vista that enhances the customer experience
7716700 you can point to apple and see what can happen when you customize your software to hardware and create a unique experience
7716701 it gave me some ideas i wouldnt have tried on my own
7716702 i thought it was cool and it was a neat little discovery to find on my computer
7716703 i hope the communications systems work better when obama is in the white house
7716704 i truly believe that peter has incredible economic credentials and its not for peter its for our nation that he should be on the frontbench
7716705 but if he doesnt have an intention that way he should declare it as such so that we dont hold up a false hope that he may come back because it makes a bit of a fool of me and a few others as well
7716706 malcolm is an outstanding contributor but weve got a leader and i think hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances he said
7716707 the last thing we want to do is develop a tradition of knifing our leaders
7716708 peter costello will make up his mind in due course but i must say peter costello said at the time of the last election that it was his intention to move into a life after politics and i took him at his word
7716709 my presumption is that he will indeed be leaving politics but he will make his position clear i suspect in the next two or three weeks
7716710 i know that even a successful war against iraq will require a u s occupation of undetermined length at undetermined cost with undetermined consequences i know that an invasion of iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the middle east and encourage the worst rather than best impulses of the arab world and strengthen the recruitment arm of al qaeda i am not opposed to all wars im opposed to dumb wars
7716711 he does have a sense of idealism and principled leadership a vision of the future
7716712 the quality or expression of what is beautiful or appealing or of more than ordinary significance
7716713 im very grateful to the soldiers and generals of the russian army who protected its own citizens and the citizens of south ossetia
7716714 it will be an historic day when not only the independence of our county is decided but also our destiny
7716715 it is the destiny of small nations who want to live in the full colours of the world adding their cultures and traditions
7716716 i think objectively president medvedev does not have any other choice but to endorse the decision of the parliament
7716717 he hasnt actually got on any room for manoeuvre if he suspends the decision thats going to cause him substantial political capital
7716718 obamas non support for gay marriage loses donation from gay media owner paul colichman
7716719 my partner looked over at me and we tore up the check
7716720 nine votes is very very close 6 1000th of a percent 13 334 votes cast i think what im looking at is the possibility of either machine error or human error that might make a difference
7716721 its unlikely they made a mistake its been certified at three different levels with no changes and we fully anticipate that even if there is a change one way or the other its unlikely it will change the outcome
7716722 you never know until you check into it no ones looked at the ballots all the canvassers certified them meaning theyve added up the numbers the number of those who voted versus the number of ballots but no ones taken a look at the actual ballots and thats what a recount is about
7716723 historically believe it or not 9 votes is a very large statistical number to overcome in a recount and there has never been at this level in the history of michigan of more than 2 votes
7716724 they will be licensed to be either a deck officer or an engineering officer in the maritime industry and they will have a bachelors degree what we are doing is aligning our tuition rate to align with that of ferris state university who is the partner with nmc
7716725 the students will not pay that full rate because of opportunities they have through ferris state so theyll have the full opportunity of getting aid through ferris state
7716726 they have a 100 percent placement rate its a seriously needed profession and is one of the things the governor has asked for looking for that high wage high need high skilled position and the maritime industry is an excellent example

7716730 i moved her out to l a to live with me i introduced her to music publishers kara and i wrote spinning around for kylie minogue when we were living together
7716731 i hope the audience gets excited and accepts it sometimes its been hard when weve had four judges in the past they always wanted four judges since the beginning itll be good to have two girls and two guys
7716732 i have spoken at length about my desires to help grow the sport of swimming and i am truly honored that sports illustrated has chosen to create this commemorative poster for fans across the us and around the world i hope the poster will serve as a reminder to all that anything is possible
7716733 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off
7716734 this convention is going to be so well orchestrated and put together that obama is going to come out with a big bump in the polls
7716735 obamas non support for gay marriage loses donation from gay media owner paul colichman
7716736 we are thrilled to join with community leaders and residents in celebrating this significant occasion
7716737 we look forward to celebrating this major step for civil rights as we continue the work to advance equal rights and opportunities for all of us in this country
7716738 david and victoria beckham were driving a car that had been scratched the day before when it had been left parked at the airport they were not involved in any accident at all
7716739 we received credible information that drug cartels in mexico have given permission to hit targets on the u s side of the border
7716740 cbp is on heightened alert ever since we became aware of the threats in mexico
7716741 we only know the engine had problems and they did not make a successful landing
7716742 theres not a thing he can do at this point were working with the u s embassy to have all of the arrangements made for the repatriation of those who are deceased and medical flights for those living
7716743 there were farmers in the field where they crashed they pulled my husband out of the plane 30 seconds before the plane exploded
7716744 he has constant pain he says he can deal with hes just grateful to be alive
7716745 he did everything he was a carpenter a multipurpose utility player he was a very popular employee forever upbeat
7716746 he was very giving i think he was in africa last year
7716747 take every precaution to try to avoid innocent civilian casualties
7716748 estas intensas precipitaciones pueden producir inundaciones repentinas y aludes de tierra peligrosos para la vida

7716755 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7716756 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7716757 i know this is not coming from barack obama but his supporters are helping us decide who to vote for
7716758 i hate the feeling that you shouldnt wear your hillary gear unless there are two or three of you together
7716759 i cant imagine not going into a convention and hearing alabama and the whole world looking up to see what comes next
7716760 but as typical of these roll calls at a certain point somebody has the votes and the protocol and graciousness come through and that will have its own dynamic
7716761 youll never see me again no matter what you do
7716762 nace a partir de que nos dimos cuenta que la gente compra canciones y no discos tengo amigos que en su mp3 tienen dos o tres canciones de diferentes bandas a veces compr s un disco y solo te gustan 3 canciones y el resto ni las escuchas por ese motivo seleccionamos entre muchas canciones solo las 4 mejores para que el oyente se quede con ganas de seguir escuchando y lo de sacar un ep por a o nos pareci una buena idea es como estar renov ndose y no tener que esperar 2 o 3 a os para sacar un disco nosotros tambi n nos cansamos de tocar las mismas canciones todo el tiempo y creo que a la gente le debe pasar lo mismo por eso nos pareci algo diferente sin desacreditar a lo dem s esto no es ninguna novedad muchas bandas inglesas y seculares lo hacen en cuanto a la pirater a creo que a ninguna banda le cae bien pero si podr as comprar un disco original por apenas un poco m s que el pirata no lo dudas un segundo as la gente va a contribuir a favor del m sico comprando algo que es original

7716764 whats the big deal about katahdin its not hard at all
7716765 migrant workers can bring enormous benefits to local businesses and areas however many of these contributions such as new ideas and ways of working and an entrepreneurial spirit may have been neglected in the past
7716766 to get the most out of migration local communities alongside local leaders businesses universities and central government need to recognise the variety of benefits that migrants can bring and plan accordingly
7716767 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future
7716768 when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying the cross
7716769 for a million dollars how many houses do you have
7716770 could i just mention to you jay that at a moment of seriousness i spent five and a half years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair
7716771 hes been a fighter for the hispanic community and i know that me personally im choosing the best candidate because hes been a fighter for the immigration issues
7716772 so for me hes the best guy to lead this nation
7716773 i like cross talking painting playing guqin a traditional musical instrument football tennis and ping pong but not singing peking opera
7716774 it is like an arranged marriage what i am doing now is trying to fall in love with it
7716775 it is too hard now to be a successful peking opera actor
7716776 i have learned peking opera since the age of 10 and done my best to practice and perform but still there are many flaws in my shows
7716777 i may never surpass my forefathers even though i have devoted all my life to improving
7716778 in the past the income of my grandfather alone could easily support a big family but now even a first rate peking opera actor finds it hard to raise a family
7716779 it is like an arranged marriage what i am doing now is trying to fall in love with it
7716780 if i dont walk upright at home my father scolds me and when i cough or yawn my mother criticises me for not using the correct pronunciation
7716781 because he thinks that the wrinkles and big eye bags have a bad impact on his stage image
7716782 he seldom praises me the highest praise i have ever got from him is just so so
7716783 but i know from my mother that in fact my grandpa is quite satisfied
7716784 i know he is unhappy to find me changing the tradition
7716785 it is only a short cut to promote peking opera
7716786 when i make a name for myself in tv and movies i can influence more people to appreciate peking opera and do something for the age old art
7716787 for instance if jackie chan were a peking opera actor i believe most of his fans would be interested in watching his peking opera shows
7716788 that the lord didnt do it all in one day what makes me think that i can
7716789 that we should be glad god doesnt give us everything we ask for
7716790 its really great to represent canada and i hope i made everyone proud
7716791 all the hard work of the past four years is worth it
7716792 im so proud to be a part of that team and that i could add a medal to that
7716793 i will remember this for the rest of my life being at the venue meeting other athletes
7716794 we started gaining medals and then we got into a good vibe everyone supported each other
7716795 this time around the whole games were very good very fun i had a great time with the team
7716796 the canadian team as a whole we really came through
7716797 i think all in all hes done a very good job
7716798 any noise of any consequence will interfere with the gold cap

7716808 t he pop critics of this world have not totally yet worked out the difference between engineering programming writing and producing electronic music visually this appears very similar a man woman sitting in front of a computer not as different as for example a drummer a brass arranger and an engineer but these are 3 completely different jobs which journalists must start to see the difference

7716811 i arrived at the hospital expecting these kids to be there with the priest by the bed instead im told i dont think the kids want to talk to you because theyre on their cell phones
7716812 absolutely out of the blue the martins contacted us saying perhaps we should put this up so the governor knows
7716813 i dont have an explanation it looks like it is off there were two periods of time when chris was on the ventilator if mark was there on september 23 or 24 its possible he chris was not on the ventilator
7716814 i have nothing to hide i have nothing to spin it is what it is i believe the explanation is there is something wrong with the date on the camera
7716815 als been calling for a real investment in renewable energy for two years and norms been ignoring the need for six years
7716816 thats the number one issue on the minds of minnesotans
7716817 norms just proposing to give away more oil to the oil companies
7716818 my whole attitude is that im really focused on the race and during the convention i just want to be campaigning in the district
7716819 the approach theyre taking seems to me little more than petty bullying
7716820 but depending on their condition and how much time theyre spending in the water this could be problematic its going to cost them more energy to swim through water than travel on land
7716821 there were some years when some bears may have had to swim as far as 100 miles
7716822 now the ice is much farther offshore more consistently and for longer so the possibility of long distances between land and sea ice is much greater
7716823 arrive so spent energetically that they literally dont move for a couple of days after hitting shore
7716824 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7716825 we believe prosocial behavior is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices they seem to care for the welfare of those they know
7716826 the bottom line is that this critically endangered species needs our help
7716827 noaas decision on these measures is based on the best data and scientific understanding available
7716828 what we have seen over and over again where economics and partisanship and political interests bump up against the science science loses

7716833 they wanted to enter europe in a big way and probably this is the reason why they have paid a higher premium
7716834 its a positive sign for the company because they were sitting on a huge cash pile and it was not generating any return
7716835 the objective is to create a leading global sap services provider
7716836 there is strong demand for these services and this will allow us to leverage the capabilities and strengths of both to have global reach scale and financial strength to participate in deals that are large
7716837 our stated policy is to move up the value chain move into the consultancy space

7716845 several soldiers who deserted after a tour of duty in iraq have stated that cruelty towards iraqi citizens was a factor in their desertions one of them lance corporal ivan brobeck witnessed the abuse of iraqi detainees and the killing of iraqi civilians another sgt ricky clousing had similar experiences his allegations of systematic abuse of iraqi detainees are now being investigated by the military
7716846 during the trial long 25 of boise idaho said he fled when his unit was deployed to iraq because he felt it was an illegal war according to cbc prosecutors on the other hand said he abandoned his duty and his country
7716847 showed a six minute video of long sporting dreadlocks and a beard telling a canadian news reporter i think i was lied to by my president
7716848 i think they want to prosecute him for free speech issues without actually charging him
7716849 was against the law arguing that justified longs fleeing to canada the lone character witness called to speak for long was peter haney with the pikes peak justice and peace commission he had met the soldier three times while long was awaiting trial in the el paso county colo lockup
7716850 ive observed mr long in situations that would be trying to just about anyone he seemed to me to be extremely poised and lucid
7716851 i feel the war on terror is a war on peace
7716852 the morality of what he did should lessen the punishment
7716853 about two dozen anti war supporters gathered around the courthouse at fort carson in colorado springs colo yesterday afternoon as a military judge handed down longs sentence
7716854 the applicant submits that if returned to the united states he will be court martialed for desertion and he will be incarcerated in a military prison where like stephen funk camilo mejia and kevin benderman he will suffer persecution and cruel and inhumane treatment
7716855 i believe the evidence here shows that if returned to the us the applicant will suffer the harm he has described

7716860 ordered the formation of a committee to find out how iraqi forces came to fight each other in baquba
7716861 hussein al zubaidi a provincial council member and nazar al khafaji the diyala university dean were arrested during the raid the official said
7716862 taha dria a shiite lawmaker from diyala who was not in the government compound during the raid said the armed forces were from iraqs emergency response unit an american trained unit similar to u s special forces
7716863 they were wearing khaki their weapons were american the humvees they used looked american they didnt have any ranks on their shoulders they didnt talk
7716864 these special forces work with the americans they are not associated with the ministry of defense they have goals and they didnt inform anyone else
7716865 that all us troops will leave by the end of 2011
7716866 i know there are always reports out there in the press and im not sure i saw exactly what prime minister maliki said but clearly from our perspective weve been working with the iraqi government for a long time on this agreement were discussing goals as you know youve heard us speak about different kinds of timelines or aspirational goals that may be acceptable i dont have anything to announce on that an agreement has not been signed and so from our perspective there is no agreement until theres an agreement signed there are discussions that continue in baghdad wed like to let them continue and to continue to show progress what were focused on is getting a good agreement not getting an agreement by a particular date so well continue those discussions
7716867 out of the more than 151 000 families who had fled their houses in baghdad just 7 112 had returned to them by mid july according to the iraqi ministry of migration
7716868 the reasons for the hesitation are complex based on dangers both real and imagined in most cases iraqis say they feel safe with their neighbors but are not sure about other residents some are afraid of the new guards on their blocks in rarer cases they cannot face neighbors who they suspect helped in killings

7716881 i dont think that senator obama understands how deep this commitment goes to hillary and where this passion comes from
7716882 im also a very very devoted democrat so this is a very hard situation john mccain is unacceptable

7716919 when i hear him on the radio his voice sounds just like george w bush and it freaks me out

7716925 it means youre not going to do whatever the person said you should do but youll believe them that its good
7716926 but still they are very powerful and they had to go in
7716927 george bush is a war criminal and he needs to be impeached but he wont be because
7716928 impeachment is when the government decides that the president might need to be removed from office so they hold a trial to see if they can vote to remove him
7716929 bill clinton was impeached but it didnt go through and
7716930 only one president has ever been impeached and it was andrew jackson
7716931 go down that way and take a right at the canal then take a left at the next bridge its down there somewhere

7716941 the questions posed to mr bonds by two different prosecutors at his grand jury appearance were imprecise redundant overlapping and frequently compound
7716942 to shed new light on the domestic economic foreign and security policy of the dollfuss and schuschnigg governments
7716943 in the wake of the disastrous anschlu and the world war those employing the words
7716944 have been blind to the enormous degree of deceit present in the european diplomatic record and above all to the perversion of language and of argument in the german documentary record
7716945 a form of authoritarian and ultra nationalist conservatism which adopts the external trappings of fascism while rejecting its call for genuine social and ethical revolution
7716946 an alliance of avowedly fascist heimwehr leaders and fascisant authoritarian conservatives
7716947 the austrian st ndestaat was indeed a contradictory and incomplete project
7716948 no convincing evidence for a direct link between the policy advice of the austrian school and the actual economic policy of the dollfuss schuschnigg era
7716949 became a tool for purely political ends of the austrian government
7716950 a strange taste for the national socialist economic policies employed in germany
7716951 the accelerating expansion of industrialization in the world economic periphery
7716952 the economic performance of the majority of austrian industrial joint stock companies was not primarily determined by economic policy
7716953 our struggle for economic existence would be for naught if the most important indeed the only basis for the state were lost namely german customs and the catholic faith which are most thoroughly anchored in the peasantry
7716954 little of the corporative and the federalist elements of the new constitution were actually implemented in political reality
7716955 to undertake the kind of exhaustive research in the required languages and from a broad international perspective that would bring us closer to the truth of what the chancellor and his colleagues believed and what they sought to do from 1934 to 1938 p
7716956 so i realized i was wrong and im going to change
7716957 your father died from heart failure your mom has already had a heart attack why do you think you can get away with slacking off from your exercise routine you need to take care of that belly and get serious about taking care of yourself
7716958 cycling would be a good exercise do you have a bicycle just put it on a stand and exercise at home
7716959 you know its funny i knew you were a hockey fan and i was wondering if you were going to tie it to organizing the thing i thought was being a fan is actually a pretty passive activity you dont have to do a whole lot
7716960 why dont we just not show up to work until they change
7716961 you know it seems like it would make sense if something was set up where all the people who work for a company own an equal part of it like stock or something
7716962 you know i dont see one reason why us truckers cant own and operate the whole company its not like the bosses know how to do this
7716963 well that makes sense things have to be this way
7716964 meth continues to just be a terrible problem for kansas
7716965 its a progression of people learning how to bypass the safeguards we have put in place
7716966 we dont even know if they went across the street or on down the road
7716967 thats what used to happen and this system makes that all go away
7716968 the pharmacists have to record all sales of this product theyre complying with the law but theyre just building up data in a lot of different pharmacies
7716969 theyll answer some questions for us at no expense to the state
7716970 thats a nice opportunity for us thats not often given
7716971 its fine and dandy when all the independents are in the loop but we need to get the chain stores involved in the loop
7716972 given the size of the olympics audience kath amp kim is not where youd like it to be you saw some boost but not significant
7716973 historically there hasnt been a huge correlation between using that platform and what happens in the fall
7716974 when youre hitting nine or 10 priorities many of them returning shows you wont expect to see as great of an awareness gain
7716975 but we did see gains the olympics in the past has been seen as a launching pad to debut new shows but thats not how we used it we took the opportunity to reinvigorate a significant amount of our returning schedule
7716976 will it have any lasting effect on people thats the real question
7716977 and with no paid media yet that has yet to come looking at what our strategy was in supporting the entire schedule i say mission accomplished
7716978 in some ways the olympics hurt the other networks more than it helped nbc
7716979 yeah i thought it was like crazy stupid so i just called it in
7716980 i was really nervous at the end of the match but that kind of ball id seen that ball often at that academy practicing with tommy haas and xavier malisse
7716981 this is kid who like pizza and he also likes to sing karaoke
7716982 the most japanese thing about him probably is that hes still really into those animated cartoons that are so big in japan he watches them on his computer
7716983 todas y cada una de las palabras a decir verdad
7716984 but each of us also comes here tonight by way of our own improbable journey i come here tonight as a sister blessed with a brother who is my mentor my protector and my lifelong friend i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world theyre the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning and the last thing i think about when i go to bed at night their future and all our childrens future is my stake in this election and i come here as a daughter raised on the south side of chicago by a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me my mothers love has always been a sustaining force for our family and one of my greatest joys is seeing her integrity her compassion and her intelligence reflected in my own daughters
7716985 and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7716986 and in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital ten years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
7716987 since our population is living longer people are developing higher expectations for a better quality of life in their senior years
7716988 its vital that we teach people how to keep their bodies and minds working at their full capacity
7716989 the medical community once thought that while the body benefited from good health choices very little could be done to help regenerate the brain we now know that the brain is very resilient and it is possible to keep the brain sharp and agile as one grows older
7716990 its never too late to improve your health if you havent had a recent medical check up then schedule a physical exam the results will show the current status of your health and reveal any underlying medical concerns this will give you a basis for creating a proactive program that you can integrate into your life if you take these steps you will have a healthier body and mind to enjoy your senior years to the fullest

7717067 religion is a fundamental need of a society that hopes to attain any sort of order
7717068 weaving a product into the entertainment as opposed to breaking up the entertainment which is what ads tend to do is a smart strategy
7717069 it is getting easier to avoid watching traditional tv advertising
7717070 the consumer increasingly has the power to change the way they consume content and that has really driven the whole trend towards product placement
7717071 those placements are not designed to jump out at you as an ad would but its still very very powerful its not explicit advertising but we do know that while youre watching a program all of the content that you see as a whole goes in
7717072 i believe people will tolerate you talking about yourself in a 30 second commercial or even a 60 second commercial but when it gets to 30 minutes youre pushing the limit when youre conscious it is a product placement it becomes distracting
7717073 i think they stopped it at 60 to 70 brands represented in that movie if you have too much product placement it just becomes an ad and people are not that interested in watching a two hour ad
7717074 theres not many places in the lineup he can hit he can hit leadoff second is an option we could flip flop and hit him ninth but i dont want to do that now i was looking for a viable option where we can use his speed

7717078 what it will mean is that theres a recognition of each countrys regulatory framework in so far as securities trading is concerned he told abc radio from washington
7717079 practically that will mean that australian brokers and the asx australian stock exchange can direct trade on securities in the us and visa versa
7717080 so it cuts out whats known as a chaperoning arrangement it cuts out red tape compliance and reduces cost for australians and reduces costs for us investors
7717081 i just got clarification on that yes you can he said
7717082 if a brokerage firm or the asx have operations online you can do it through that format
7717083 i think there might be interest in both countries because it does reduce compliance costs and red tape and there are savings involved for operating through the mutual agreement he said
7717084 very importantly this is the first time that the united states has recognised any other countrys jurisdiction in the world we are the first
7717085 they have recognised that australia does have a reliable regulatory framework in securities trading such that the us will recognise australias robustness and regulatory oversight
7717086 therell be more liquidity therell be more flow i think broadly will be the improvement and therell be a reduce compliance and red tape cost in investment and thats got to be a good thing he said
7717087 the president is a cross eyed texan warmonger unelected inarticulate who epitomises the arrogance of american foreign policy
7717088 i dont believe that is necessarily any more dangerous than the many other risky things that people do with their free hands while driving nose picking reading the paper studying the a z beating the children and so on
7717089 i forgot that to rely on a train in blairs britain is to engage in a crapshoot with the devil
7717090 i can hardly condemn ukip as a bunch of boss eyed foam flecked euro hysterics when i have been sometimes not far short of boss eyed foam flecked hysteria myself

7717099 for 10 years we in the tory party have become used to papua new guinea style orgies of cannibalism and chief killing and so it is with happy amazement that we watch as the madness engulfs the labour party
7717100 the lib dems are not just empty they are a void within a vacuum surrounded by a vast inanition
7717101 knowing the designs and deceptions of the iraqi regime we have every reason to assume the worst
7717102 there is a need to see climate change as an issue of global social justice the rights interests and needs of those affected by climate change must be acknowledged
7717103 did michelles brother just tell us that based on playing a game of one on one with barack he concluded that obama was a great team player

7717114 why is it that the stars that shine the brightest in our lives seem to be taken too soon
7717115 but bricks and mortar have not raised student performance testing data shows
7717116 at west the number of students who posted proficient or advanced level scores declined by six percentage points in math seven in reading and language arts and eight in science eisenhower scores in each academic area saw a dip but smaller than at west from one percentage point in language arts to five in science

7717119 well son it is a memorial to the young men and women who died in the service
7717120 i hope they like dont ask us like who the president of iraq is
7717121 each one us of here today will at one time in our lives look upon a loved one who is in need and ask the same question we are willing to help lord but what if anything is needed for it is true we can seldom help those closest to us either we dont know what part of ourselves to give or more often than not the part we have to give is not wanted and so it those we live with and should know who elude us but we can still love them we can love completely without complete understanding
7717122 el que estudia a bol var siente al terminar su tarea la misma reverencia que se experimenta al dejar un lugar sagrado donde el esp ritu ha estado bajo la influencia de lo sobrenatural y lo sublime
7717123 mi destino ha querido que una vasta porci n del mundo halla aprovechado de mis combates para romper sus cadenas este es todo mi m rito
7717124 lo que es el pueblo su credulidad e ignorancia hacen de los cat licos una secta de id latras que hecha peste sobre los paganos nativos de am rica porque adoraban las estatuas de sus dioses mientras impon an la adoraci n y al culto de estatuas de piedra esculturas de madera groseramente esculpidas y retazos de lienzos mal embadurnados que le generan inmensas riquezas ah sacerdotes hip critas e ignorantes en estas dos clases los pongo a todos
7717125 better to be entertaining than tedious when talking of serious things
7717126 there is now a wealth of evidence that climate change has had and will have further impact on a variety of allergenic plants
7717127 longer pollen seasons greater exposure and increased disease burden for late summer weeds such as ragweed
7717128 for those who feel their lives are a grave disappointment to god
7717129 come to me all you who labour and are heavy burdened
7717130 es una responsabilidad enorme y much sima presi n no s lo estamos yendo a defender el t tulo sino que vamos en representaci n de todo el continente
7717131 thats great but remember no one comes to jesus because of arguments
7717132 mccabe said madison has changed greatly since he first began working there in 1981 he said the way politics is done in 2008 would be unrecognizable compared to 1981 politics the culprit said mccabe is the large amount of money in politics especially the large amount of dollars going to political action committees pals organizations that take donations without having to disclose their sources while political candidates are required to disclose all of their donations and the law restricts how much individuals can give to each candidate mccabe repeatedly used wisconsin manufacturers amp commerce wmc as an example
7717133 in later comments state sen bob jauch said more democrats are needed in madison to bring about needed reform jauch was asked if the democratically controlled u s legislature senate and house had created any significant campaign reform after gaining control in 2006 jauch was unable to mention any federal reform he did direct some angry comments at wmc which has placed issue ads against jauch he said the wmc acted like the ku klux klan in bullying candidates take the hoods off jauch said of the wmc
7717134 it can also be inferred that kevin fischer has a distaste for pro life wisconsin types on yesterdays show he referred to people who objected to abortion for rape and incest victims as
7717135 and if being pro life means that kevin calls me a
7717136 the effect of prayer on god s attitude toward mankind
7717137 the empirical conclusion from this analysis is important a little prayer does no good and may make things worse much prayer helps a lot
7717138 i think this is a great place to get a little attention on what no child left behind is doing to our kids and to our teachers
7717139 i just slapped it together with some glue and put it on

7717144 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7717145 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7717146 the vice president will be delivering the word of americas support
7717147 that sends the message to the kremlin that it risks international isolation
7717148 mr cheney is widely viewed by the russian political elite as the toughest hawk on russia in the bush administration
7717149 it hasnt gone unanswered in fact id say its been loudly answered
7717150 i dont think theres any question that russias reputation has suffered since it took these disproportionate military steps in georgia
7717151 the theory behind the design was to try to bring the american people into the process
7717152 but its an interesting question whether dazzling is what the obama campaign needs right now
7717153 could i just mention to you jay that in a moment of seriousness i spent five and a half years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair
7717154 i spent those five and half years not because i wanted to get a house when i got back home
7717155 hes a guy who barely got out of high school fought in world war ii in the army came home and made a business and made the american dream
7717156 we spend our time in a condominium in washington a condominium in phoenix some time over here in the state of california and then we have a place up in northern arizona
7717157 and my friends im proud of my record of service to this country and it has nothing to do with houses
7717158 the white house was saved by the action of one brave soldier john mccain
7717159 i know youve been asking about who i want to be my running mate
7717160 wouldnt it be good to have a person you dont know what party theyre with they have no political principles whatsoever they may need a job about that time
7717161 not only do i want an elite president i want someone whos embarrassingly superior to me
7717162 i think hell be a bit embarrassed to see us all but hes been the world champion for so long and now finally hes got gold
7717163 its a very exciting time and its her first olympics shes been so inspirational
7717164 it is really nice to come home to a nice reception and theres nothing better than coming home
7717165 im going to have a really nice long break and decide what i want to do just do all the things that i havent been able to do and then decide when i want to get back in the pool
7717166 ive had a really hard run but ive had a fantastic time in beijing and i have a beautiful piece of silver hanging around my neck and now that weve finally touched down in sydney its such a great feeling
7717167 swimmers get up really early every day so itll be really nice to stay in bed as long as i want

7717171 the full intro for crysis warhead leaked game looks awesome
7717172 easily the greatest bargain among pocket cameras the canon sd1100 has it all small size sleek design optical image stabilization a good lens face detection custom modes and a low price though its an improvement over last years incredibly popular sd1000 the canon sd1100 retains the impressive image quality despite a slight increase in resolution from 7 1 to 8 0 megapixels the canon sd1100 increased in thickness just a little probably due to the addition of image stabilization but its still quite comfortable to hold and it slips discretely into most pockets
7717173 the powershot sd1100 produces very good quality photos though there are some negatives worth mentioning
7717174 the canon sd1100 is physically attractive but its images arent always as beautiful
7717175 this camera comes out of the box set for fully automatic point and shoot it is easy enough to change to the manual mode to get control of the iso speed setting but perhaps most people wont bother as a point and shoot it is one of the best at this price its face area is slightly smaller than a credit card and it is 20mm thick so it fits easily in a shirt pocket its winning feature is the optical viewfinder only sony offer a compact with viewfinder at this price if your aim is to share photos by internet or to make 10 by 15cm prints then this camera is a winner
7717176 great features and great results in a camera of great design
7717177 canon has introduced yet another stylish and appealing ultra compact model in their digital elph line
7717178 the sd1100 is an impressive camera particularly when compared to the competition but it does not quite equal the camera it replaced the sd1000 image quality was good but images did have chromatic aberration overall its a sturdy camera with image stabilization it just does not match the earlier sd1000
7717179 as long as youre outdoors in bight light your photos will look good but move indoors and raise the iso and all of a sudden things get a lot worse as far as picture quality its tiny and stylish heck it even has image stabilization all for a small price tag but just as soon as the light level goes down the camera images have some pretty serious noise problems
7717180 canon leads the field in image quality because it relies on intelligent solutions not quick fixes
7717181 every camera released today incorporates class leading features to combat common problems like camera shake and subject blur without sacrificing overall image quality
7717182 im pretty sure i just molested a congressional candidate it was an accident
7717183 dnc08 back in the big tent and getting ready to post more pictures so stay tuned sinfonian
7717184 wondering if doug and i can get into the big tent

7717189 punk rock is exemplary manners towards your fellow human beings
7717190 usually i would pass even reading the music blogs that are all independent music but this one was actually good because it did not seem like you had to be a scenester knowing the secret handshake to be allowed to read it they have a good collection of artists from all over the map which is always what i like to see and they have this funny ad running on there site to bring 44 to singapore
7717191 punk rock is exemplary manners towards your fellow human beings

7717193 punk rock is exemplary manners towards your fellow human beings

7717195 if he wants to come out and talk about it hes more than welcome to
7717196 but since he doesnt live his life in the public eye its something i want to keep private
7717197 durante nuestra convenci n vamos a demostrar a todos los estadounidenses por qu necesitamos a barack obama y joe biden en la casa blanca
7717198 desde esta tribuna veo en la diversidad de esta asamblea de dem cratas el reflejo de la fuerza y la unidad de nuestro partido
7717199 he venido aqu como una esposa que ama a su marido y cree que barack obama ser un presidente extraordinario
7717200 he venido aqu como una madre cuyas ni as son el coraz n de mi coraz n y el centro de mi mundo
7717201 en noviembre se entregar la antorcha otra vez a una nueva generaci n de estadounidenses de modo que para obama para ustedes y para m nuestro pa s va a estar comprometido con su causa
7717202 el trabajo va a volver a empezar volver la esperanza y el sue o seguir
7717203 estoy aqu para rendir homenaje a dos hombres que cambiaron mi vida y la vida del pa s barack obama y ted kennedy
7717204 les pido a ustedes que me han apoyado y a quienes siempre les estar agradecida que trabajen tan duro en favor de barack obama como lo han hecho por m durante las primarias
7717205 the point was really to introduce michelle to the public for the first time and let them see that she is very different from the caricatures displayed in the news
7717206 michelle is not a politician she is a mother and a wife and a working woman and a community organizer
7717207 he still has trouble putting the bread up and putting his socks actually in the dirty clothes and he still doesnt do a better job than our 5 year old daughter sasha making his bed so you have to forgive me if im a little stunned by this whole barack obama thing
7717208 for the first in my adult life i am proud of my country because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback
7717209 the selfish part of her would say she wants him home for her children
7717210 but for the sake of her children she wants him to win this election
7717211 so i think theyre at a different point in their life now
7717212 but there is a sacrifice i dont want to underestimate that
7717213 podr a considerarse si no se aplican los medios necesarios para evitarlo que las extradiciones de los principales responsables de las autodefensas unidas puede ser un obst culo insalvable para la aplicaci n de justicia y paz y se har a necesaria la intervenci n de la fiscal a de la corte penal internacional y en su caso mediante la aplicaci n del principio de justicia penal universal que otros sistemas judiciales
7717214 por lo tanto deber n implementarse los medios a trav s de acuerdos con las autoridades norteamericanas
7717215 que se llegue con todas las garant as penales a los funcionarios p blicos que hayan podido prestar apoyo o aprovechado de los criminales y por eso el sistema judicial necesita credibilidad
7717216 we were wondering if larger animals also have this magnetic sense
7717217 sometimes it took hours and hours to find some pictures with good resolution
7717218 in africa and south america the cattle were shifted slightly to a more north eastern south western direction
7717219 but it is known that the earths magnetic field is much weaker there
7717220 ive never noticed that my cows all face the same way
7717221 they all sit down before it rains and huddle together in a circle formation during blizzards but from a cows point of view thats just sensible
7717222 we need to think about some really fundamental things that this sensory ability provides in animals
7717223 es como morder la mano al amigo que nos da de comer
7717224 mel manuel zelaya mete hoy al pa s en la aventura del alba
7717225 the world begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7717226 this is the cause of my life new hope that we will break the old gridlock and
7717227 we believe the effect of the troubles in the subprime sector on the broader housing market will likely be limited and we do not expect significant spillovers from the subprime market to the rest of the economy or to the financial system
7717228 either in recession or face significant recession risks in the months ahead
7717229 vis a vis expats sitting behind their bottle of chang and moaning about how
7717230 and as a result have no idea what thailand is all about
7717231 she might be able to clue you in on a few aspects of thai society that you seem a bit confused about
7717232 moskva has today departed toward the black sea fleets naval training range to check its radio controlled weapons and onboard communications systems
7717233 the fact that there are nine western warships in the black sea cannot but be a cause for concern they include two u s warships one each from spain and poland and four from turkey
7717234 we need to look seriously at how to modernize our regulatory structure
7717235 what we have learned from the past two years is that the old form of regulation is broken
7717236 the exact form of the reform is something that we are learning about
7717237 before we go to the conclusion that the fed should be the single regulator i believe personally that there was a significant failure of regulation by the federal reserve that was part of this crisis
7717238 there was no effort to take a rule we already have a regulation we already have to try to rein in the subprime market lending
7717239 but another problem is that many military bases where russians were have since been mined so now were de mining
7717240 we have already started negotiations on the purchase of new equipment and weapons from our western partners
7717241 i used to look at bud grants teams remember bud grant
7717242 youve got more of the concerns weve seen about credit and the financials lehmans down because of the speculation that the bid is not happening and theres a negative report on aig
7717243 the credit crisis is more than a year old and still there are lots and lots of issues
7717244 investor psychology is certainly suffering from credit crisis fatigue people are disappointed that the situation is not visibly improving
7717245 clearly there is no light at the end of the housing tunnel yet
7717246 the supply of unsold homes is still very high suggesting theres going to be downward pressure on prices well into 2009
7717247 the time has come by making itself the broker of the peace deal the eu has the responsibility to ensure it is followed through otherwise it could lose face
7717248 but there are still big divisions and they are not going to go away
7717249 well have to see we have to take stock of the situation
7717250 an esdp european security and defence policy mission is one option but the question is what form at the moment it seems it would be more about monitoring than peacekeeping
7717251 russia seeks only a vague document while the eu wants a legally binding treaty that includes trade and energy
7717252 a threat to the success of those games would be taken seriously by the russians
7717253 judging by the rhetoric of the last few days it seems things are moving toward a sharp confrontation between russia and practically the whole of the rest of the world
7717254 that has every chance of spilling out into real action from both sides perhaps the halting of the wto accession process could be the first real step a real consequence of the war
7717255 we propose continuing negotiations within the framework of the working group on wto accession but informing our partners of the need to exit some agreements which currently oppose the interests of the russian federation
7717256 we dont feel or see any advantages from membership if they exist at all but we are carrying the burden
7717257 certain sectors of our economy above all agriculture are carrying a fairly heavy load
7717258 its another reason for investors to question the governments commitment to not just the reform agenda but the whole economic program that was set out as part of the political transition
7717259 the main concern for investors from all these recent events is that the program could be materially changing i e perhaps less emphasis on the diversification and the openness
7717260 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7717261 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7717262 there continues to be a large presence of russian forces in georgia
7717263 its fair to say that they are still not living up to the terms of the ceasefire agreement
7717264 the vice president will be delivering the word of americas support and also consulting on how these leaders in the region see the future playing out
7717265 thats something that obviously we are going to have to evaluate given the current situation i dont have any announcements on that one way or another
7717266 this is a very real tragedy and our condolences go the family of claire i have met them and there is no doubt they are devastated by the events that have taken claire from them
7717267 we are pushing this material to uk media channels eg a bbc radio programme exposing tensions between aq al qaeda leadership and supporters
7717268 and a restricted working group will communicate niche messages through media and non media
7717269 we are not claiming victory over aq we are stressing their declining support
7717270 to reach the very top of any sport requires years of hard work focus and complete dedication all traits which rebecca has in abundance
7717271 i want to thank absolutely everyone who helped my partner lachlan and my mum vivienne here to support me and watch me get gold because it was so important to have those two people here with me
7717272 i did not think i had a chance to get the gold and to actually get that was mind blowing i was crying thinking i had silver and to get gold i was a blubbering mess
7717273 its a big story the only openly gay male athlete in beijing pulled off one of the great upsets at the olympics in a spectacular fashion
7717274 if he had had cancer or if his parents had been killed in a car crash when he was 2 or if he had just proposed to his girlfriend they would have mentioned it but they never showed him hugging his boyfriend never mentioned it they referred to personal problems but im afraid they decided matthews sexuality was off limits a real shame
7717275 in the south perhaps more than any other region we go back to our home in dreams and memories hoping it remains what it was on a lazy still summers day twenty years ago
7717276 there continues to be a large presence of russian forces in georgia
7717277 its fair to say that they are still not living up to the terms of the ceasefire agreement
7717278 the president felt it was important to have the vice president consult with allies in the region on our common security interests
7717279 the department of state urges u s citizens in georgia to exercise caution while traveling
7717280 these were men who had been sentenced and found guilty by the supreme court walking around freely
7717281 liberal leader stephane dion refuses to be rushed into a crucial meeting with stephen harper that will determine whether the country is plunged into an election within the next two weeks
7717282 dion is essentially refusing to meet and not only refusing to meet refusing to speak by phone
7717283 this is a sign that hes for all intents and purposes broken off communication with the prime minister
7717284 sending canadians into a 400 million federal election wont be decided over the phone or a text message the issues facing canadians are too important
7717285 its not a statesman were dealing with here its a quitter

7717296 i have always had a dread of becoming a passenger in life
7717297 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7717298 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7717299 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger
7717300 people just come to me and say oh im happy for you
7717301 i dont know what is best to be a little bit tired but very comfortable and very positive or to be fresh and not play in the olympic games
7717302 i hope shes not born on labor day weekend the traffic would be terrible getting up there
7717303 political instability has pakistanis and their foreign backers including the united states worried that the government is too distracted to tackle rising islamic militancy and serious economic problems
7717304 squabbling between the coalition leaders has revived memories of the divisive politics of the 1990s and has distracted attention from pakistans fight against islamic militants and the worsening economy
7717305 the ppp still would have enough allies in parliament to hold the government together with the withdrawal of sharifs party but analysts say that governing in the long term would be difficult with

7717417 if he can come here after what hes been through he shows the american people how important this election is and that no sacrifice is too great

7717430 we will not rest until the prisoners are freed and the jails are empty
7717431 the crumbling kadima government continues to demonstrate weakness that causes national humiliation

7717434 we salute them and we must do all that we can to liberate them
7717435 we had lost hope that my brother would be released because hes been in prison for 32 years
7717436 its not easy for israel to release prisoners some of the individuals being released today are guilty of direct involvement in the murder of innocent civilians
7717437 we believe this action can support the negotiation process and create goodwill

7717544 we know what fairness and opportunity and justice look like and isnt that the great american story
7717545 so you dont think i can top your past gifts you dont have much faith in me do you
7717546 he is a man of extraordinary character integrity sense of honor and duty
7717547 the first time we were communicating we were tapping through walls
7717548 i was a prisoner 6 years and 4 months 2305 days
7717549 we had this camaraderie that we just wouldnt quit we reinforced each other we helped each other get through the crisis and we just learned to live with it and cope with it and its that kind of mental toughness that i think we need in a president
7717550 he knows how to take responsibility he knows how to courageously make a decision he has life experiences that his opponent can only imagine
7717551 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7717552 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7717553 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7717554 she crisscrosses the country on the company jet keeps an accountant on the company payroll to mind her personal finances drives a company lexus with ms bud plates and says she oversees the companys
7717555 her business recently found itself at odds with advocates for pediatric hospital beds in arizonas neediest communities and for a statewide childhood education program when the advocates proposed initiatives that would raise liquor taxes hensley opposed them
7717556 at the national level the companys priorities fought for by the national beer wholesalers association include rolling back the national excise tax of about 5 cents a beer last raised in 1991 and fighting efforts by hard liquor distillers to require labels showing the amount of alcohol in a standard serving the beer lobby also successfully opposed a bill to pay for television advertisements combating under age drinking
7717557 a campaign of deception and distortion has helped to ensure that mccains extreme positions and politically inspired flip flops remain far from the consciousness of the average voter
7717558 she crisscrosses the country on the company jet keeps an accountant on the company payroll to mind her personal finances drives a company lexus with ms bud plates and says she oversees the companys
7717559 i really do feel sorry for anybody that wants to go up against our defense
7717560 he knows all the calls and the checks we are probably going to rely on him to be responsible for a majority of the calls out there hell be an extremely valuable player in our scheme
7717561 its a linebacker friendly defense there is no question about it
7717562 those guys will get a lot of the action with the guys up front taking a lot of the bullets and taking care of the blocking schemes which will allow our linebackers to run
7717563 i kind of made my name for getting sacks so im looking forward to blitzing the quarterback more
7717564 the 3 4 definitely fits my style of play because i like to be on the attack
7717565 what i see with our linebackers is a lot of good athletes
7717566 its good to see they can come at you at any time they can run the field and they make big plays with big hits those are the type of guys that you want leading your defense and we are very fortunate to have them
7717567 id say defensively the depth at the linebacker corps is definitely a strength of ours and that is really what you need to be strong when you run the 3 4 defensive package is a lot of linebackers
7717568 and i think the group we have right now allows us to do a lot of things
7717569 this surcharge will increase the level of assistance for students to be properly prepared for careers after graduation
7717570 students are going to get every penny back as it relates to student services
7717571 i think its necessary if its going to help students succeed in the long run
7717572 while ultimately the legislatures of the various states will decide this debate our view is that the consequences of underage drinking are simply too significant to ignore
7717573 we want to encourage an honest and constructive dialogue among educators lawmakers parents and students
7717574 some of them just stop there and say its illegal
7717575 unfortunately alcohol and drug use has been manufactured into showing that as ok now im an adult
7717576 it was clear to me that they didnt see this as a dialogue they saw this as some kind of effort on our part to turn our schools into party schools
7717577 if you endorse responsible drinking youre condoning certain behavior that is illegal
7717578 a college president cant take that position not if he wants to keep his job
7717579 they are always worried about the commotion drinking causes on campus and now they want to lower the drinking age
7717580 they are just going to have more problems if that happens
7717581 the problem of alcohol abuse cant be solved by lowering the age
7717582 alcohol abuse is a matter of education we need to continue to look for ways to make students aware of the help we offer and how to be responsible
7717583 a lot of people drink because they are not allowed to
7717584 changing the law might not have a big effect but an 18 year old should be able to drink and be accountable for what they do
7717585 there are debates about legalizing marijuana so i dont see why this law couldnt actually happen
7717586 its like learning a completely new language and a new way of life
7717587 if you come in your first year and the only thing you do is study law its not healthy
7717588 thats quite scary if you have not looked at any exam examples in the past
7717589 it would give them more time to actually go through these bills see if they meet our funding guidelines and also see if the groups meet the criteria to get credit
7717590 spring allocations is such a different beast than regular allocations
7717591 the difference is that maybe they wont be so busy with everything else
7717592 and on top of their regular duties with the finance committee its just really hard on them
7717593 you cant come in and request funding from students pockets to put on an event and then not have your after action report to tell how the event went
7717594 i dont have to worry if she doesnt get a job right away when she graduates because she will still be covered if she was to get sick
7717595 you should be responsible for paying your own insurance because you are considered an adult when you graduate and thats your responsibility
7717596 only a dramatic drop in enrollment for the plan or more people obtaining the refund would change it
7717597 we believe that businesses should determine what their benefits are and they shouldnt be forced to cover these adults
7717598 nobody can find a job right out of college with good benefits
7717599 i think the judge made a good point when he said that it was an aggravating component to the sentence
7717600 sitting here in the real america that is ohio watching the democratic convention on a duraband tube purchased at a wal mart and having just suffered through the ted kennedy a palooza im just getting a sense of dread for the political process
7717601 the kennedy tribute was at best bizarre and at worst embarrassing
7717602 theyre all sweet and theyre all trying so hard and working so hard and i wouldnt trade places with them for all the tea in china i figure if you can go through these grueling weeks that theyve gone through after this theyll be able to do just about anything
7717603 i really thought long and hard on this whole thing and ive been watching them for a few weeks just to prepare myself so i would have some real criticism or some constructive criticism for them and ive thrown it their way and they can either take it or leave it i guess
7717604 some of them breathe in the middle of phrases and you have to breathe at the beginning of a phrase and at the end of the thought because if you breathe in the middle of it then you break that train of thought and those are things i learned because i was trained very young i was trained for three years when i was 15 and those were the very first things that i learned but these kids havent had that opportunity so i just thought i would pass that along to them
7717605 its something that if you start early enough and you really work on it it comes easy its like muscle memory you just remember how to do that and you remember that breathing is well its everything
7717606 i think we have to be concerned and focus on what we have to do now the job at hand is to do the best performances they can and impress i mean its a daunting task for these young men to try and impress people and some of them are trying to do it with all their vocal licks and some of them were trying to do it with their guitar playing each has a talent so i dont envy them that task of trying to win over judges and people sitting at home and so on its tough going
7717607 i have no idea why snowbird was a hit it was just one of those things it was meant to be
7717608 the song came my way i mean what are the chances of that and the next thing i know its on the top 40 in the u
7717609 here i am 40 years later and im still working
7717610 ive been receiving letters and now e mails from people for years and years and years people telling me their stories and why certain songs have affected them and what impact those songs have had on their lives so ive been very touched over the years i wouldnt have been in this business if i hadnt felt this is what i wanted to do and it was important to me but i didnt realize how important it was to other people until i started hearing back from them
7717611 it was a very pleasant surprise the experience itself was great too because i got to meet a lot of wonderful singers and wonderful ladies and spent a little time with them in the studio and we had a lot of fun doing this it was a lot of work but well worth it
7717612 i never dreamed the album is one of the biggest albums ive hit in years and years and years so its kind of nice after all these years to know you can still do it and that people are interested
7717613 my kids call me the mistress of christmas because they say everywhere they go at christmas time they hear my music in malls and everywhere so i thought i had recorded every christmas song there was but i guess not
7717614 that christmas album is the next project and well see what happens after that
7717615 you had a right to expect an excellent job and we didnt do it next time around its going to be excellent
7717616 it took a long time to see the amount of physicians we have participate in this plan
7717617 the attached print ad part of a series of similar ads run by glaxosmithkline is the most egregious example of this type of advertising this ad is designed to instill fear in the minds of aids patients by telling them that switching aids treatment presumably from gsk drugs may lead to increased side effects and potentially treatment failure this message is gsks response to the increased number of patients switching from its drugs to newer treatments and seeks to discourage aids patients from changing their antiretroviral arv regimens regardless of their medical needs further the explicit message in this ad avoid hidden dangers from switching your hiv medicine is that safety and efficacy information provided by a patients doctor or the fda is incorrect or misleading
7717618 the ads are part of a larger trend of drug companies taking aim at rival hiv drugs hinting at side effects and other drawbacks experts say
7717619 a development fueling the sharp elbows advertising the market for hiv medicines has grown crowded and companies want to protect their market share
7717620 can be deceiving avoid hidden dangers from changing your hiv medicines
7717621 if you are thinking about switching your hiv medicine make sure you know what youre getting into
7717622 with these latest ads gsk has sunk to a new low the company has resorted to exploiting patient fears in order to sell a product while remaining unconcerned about the harm caused to patients who are scared off treatment altogether because of gsks tactics
7717623 we are disappointed that poz magazine a publication targeted to an hiv positive population would run such ads this kind of underhanded negative advertising creates fear of hiv treatment in general which could dissuade people from seeking treatment at all we are also disappointed that despite repeated communication with the fda regarding our concerns over a similar gsk ad campaign last year there appears to be a total lack of oversight of direct to consumer advertising of prescription drugs that is why we are appealing to hhs in the hopes that our concerns will be heard and these harmful ads pulled
7717624 the 64 000 question is are you going to eat deli meats
7717625 damage control and financial minimization at a time like this has not even been considered
7717626 the short term financial impact of this action is secondary to our responsibility to safeguard our consumers health
7717627 for a number of reasons we believe the situation is different
7717628 first of all food borne illnesses are an everyday risk that producers must watch for and as such customers may be more understanding secondly maple leaf can supply its customers from other facilities so customers do not need to turn to a competitor
7717629 will consumers react the same way its too early to tell
7717630 this may serve the company well in the eyes of customers
7717631 huge disaster that you might as well write of the brand at that point
7717632 consumers will be wondering when they are buying private label product whether it is maple leaf product even if they are buying stuff at restaurants
7717633 four sesame street figurines and an angelz boxed doll were found to be dangerous because they produced small parts which could pose a choking hazard to children
7717634 endeavour to score a perfect 10 dive into the water
7717635 my daughter did this to me because i hurt the mother
7717636 i have to pray five times a day for what i have done
7717637 prime is poised to deliver a strong ratings performance in this period and capture a dominant revenue share in its markets notwithstanding a tightening in broader market conditions
7717638 the 2009 edition of the age good food guide is fearless and compelling
7717639 please take these instructions to heart and abide by them
7717640 she was deliberately very forcefully thrown out by a very strong man
7717641 high interest rates hit consumer confidence first and the stark evidence is in the latest retail trade figures which show a substantial decline of 0 6 per cent in the june quarter
7717642 when you combine high interest rates with other factors like rising petrol prices consumer confidence is hit hard and discretionary spending by families is wiped out
7717643 the reserve bank has accomplished its job inflation needed to be tackled but the job is now done and its time to relent and offer families some relief
7717644 the kiwi has been hit very hard and the aussie has gone along for the ride
7717645 i cant see any blue sky at the moment i cant see any valid reason why youd really want to be buying the aussie at the moment
7717646 the aussie has a good reason to be down here
7717647 theres not a lot of positive news out there for the aussie at the moment not enough to counter this down move
7717648 it is unfortunate that the defendant should introduce the concept of accusations of spying and awkwardness all keen golfers participate because of the thrill of competition not industrial espionage
7717649 number one they need to import a large amount of wheat
7717650 if they need wheat right now the us is the place to go
7717651 the idea of that in 2000 was to promote certain types of exports to sanctioned countries so there would be food medicine agricultural products medical products
7717652 it is still surprising that they are buying wheat from the us instead of waiting to buy wheat from someone else
7717653 maybe the relationship between iran and the us is not as terrible as it has been
7717654 iran is more interested in showing to its people that it is not restrained by sanctions
7717655 the real signal is look were doing fine we can buy wheat from the us
7717656 this is a serious setback for iran from a domestic point of view because they made a big deal about self sufficiency in grains
7717657 when you win in three sets it is a good results
7717658 i had some difficult moments in the match so that is going to help me be prepared for the pressure moments later on
7717659 i was trying to stay focussed as well as i could
7717660 its a matter of how fresh i can stay for this tournament
7717661 i want to get some rest and make sure i dont practise as much as i did in beijing i need to save some energy for this tournament
7717662 i tried to keep my level up i tried to hurry him
7717663 he was hitting his forehand really hard and making me do a bit of running
7717664 it was a decent test and i came through it pretty well
7717665 there have been some great performances from a lot of players this year but we dont have anything like justine who was able to win every single tournament
7717666 in the first set i felt like i was playing against a wall
7717667 in the second set i told myself to just play your game and dont give up
7717668 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and me our country will be committed to his cause
7717669 the work will begin anew the hope will rise again and the dream lives on
7717670 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future and to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7717671 barack obama and edward m kennedy their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7717672 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7717673 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7717674 i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world
7717675 we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7717676 let there be no mistake about it we are united
7717677 hillary wants us to support obama the same we supported her and thats what we are gonna do
7717678 i feel pretty good about my chances especially now that ive got one of the finest statesmen in this country on my ticket joe biden as vice president
7717679 given such a strong decline on wall street you are going to get declines in our market
7717680 we will probably finish in the red today maybe something over one to one and a half per cent
7717681 anz have taken steps to clear out people who were in charge of some of the key areas in the last few year
7717682 maybe that is causing a positive view on anz as they have been cut back substantially in the last month or so
7717683 no se puede decir simplemente que x86 va a resolver el problema de la computaci n masiva paralela
7717684 el multi proceso es un gran problema de las ciencias de la computaci n lleva ah 30 a os y no ha sido respondido por herramientas de software
7717685 suena bien pero han descuidado media docena de cosas tan importantes como la ampliaci n de ancho de banda de la memoria y otras
7717686 la realidad va a estar por debajo de sus previsiones tan optimistas
7717687 ati no invierte en cosas como physx y cuda que van m s all de los gr ficos aunque la percepci n de esas herramientas a la hora de medir una gpu va a evolucionar
7717688 i have never pretended to political correctness so i can happily abhor the sanctimonious politically correct bullshit that made the british contribution to the olympic closing ceremony so appalling
7717689 the first time i had no 11 i was in the seventh grade
7717690 i had two good years in middle school and my sister said i was back to where i started this is chance to remember the good things that happened in my life it doesnt matter which number i have on my back i have to go out there and play for my teammates
7717691 this has been a horrible situation for marcus and we are in the middle of this horrible process of trying to figure out the best avenue for marcus
7717692 while we are in that process its incumbent of me to respect that process and his privacy
7717693 im happy to be with an organization that is honest and up front right from the top you dont have to play a guessing game and i think every player has to go through that im tired of that and im getting treated well here thats the one thing i want from any organization is to be treated well and some respect ive felt that since i stepped off the plane
7717694 michael demonstrated monday that he has some basic concepts arm strength and mobility
7717695 you dont have that in toronto because nobody really knows who you are
7717696 im looking forward to it because this team is driven by the fans
7717697 the fact that people were afraid that our dance would be misinterpreted makes me frustrated that fear dominates
7717698 its frustrating as an artist to feel that youre irrelevent
7717699 this is the first campaign to allow this kind of public art on this scale
7717700 at this point in the race i feel like its the democrats to lose
7717701 i suspect were going to have to take a look at that
7717702 really the safest thing you can do is make all your food at home from scratch period
7717703 sometimes we buy the product anyway and sometimes we dont
7717704 what does this really mean can i count on it as a consumer to really have any meaning
7717705 advisory labeling may not be protecting the health of allergic consumers
7717706 not suitable for consumption by persons with an allergy to x
7717707 the healing process is going to be a little longer than four days
7717708 i find him inexperienced i find him insincere we have an unqualified candidate who has little more than empty rhetoric and a lot of money at his disposal
7717709 these intense rains may produce life threatening flash floods and mudslides
7717710 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7717711 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7717712 has anyone ever told you youre like martha stewart on steroids or crack
7717713 fought a good fight he finished the course and he kept the faith
7717714 life is measure not by the number of breaths you take but the number of moments that take your breath away
7717715 were entirely legal and well ahead of the industry standards of the times
7717716 el reto es sobrevivir al gobierno que desprecia a los m dicos
7717717 nos encontramos en medio de una dif cil campa a presidencial tengo a un oponente muy honorable hay fuertes diferencias entre nosotros
7717718 yo s que tienen estudiantes que vienen de todo el mundo s que hay personas que vienen de varias naciones algunas de ellas desde irak donde han visto c mo es la guerra y el sacrificio
7717719 creo en sus ideales y propuestas el mccain ha sido un luchador por la comunidad hispana ha sido un palad n de los temas migratorios dijo yankee
7717720 no nos llevaremos su dinero y nos iremos competiremos en california
7717721 el reto es sobrevivir al gobierno que desprecia a los m dicos
7717722 amigos dem cratas amigos estadounidenses es tan maravilloso estar aqu nada nada me habr a impedido estar en esta reuni n
7717723 el reto es sobrevivir al gobierno que desprecia a los m dicos
7717724 oh man at the end of the night it felt like i had just woken up an hour ago
7717725 the fact that these animals dont die and are restored to normal health despite a total lack of insulin is hard for many researchers and clinicians to believe
7717726 many scientists including us thought it would be a waste of time to give leptin in the absence of insulin weve been brainwashed into thinking that insulin is the only substance that can correct the consequences of insulin deficiency
7717727 but if we gave them the leptin gene within two weeks the terminally ill rodents were restored to full health without any other treatment
7717728 my hope is that you could give leptin for one type of action glucagons suppression for example and insulin for another or perhaps give a substance other than insulin entirely
7717729 what would be a tremendous advance would be the ability to give an oral agent that suppresses glucagon without injections
7717730 one of the things that happens when a child gets type 1 diabetes is their growth is stunted until theyre given insulin
7717731 the same is true with these mice however we found that if you take a diabetic rat thats not receiving insulin and make it hyperleptinemic it almost catches up growthwise
7717732 in a longstanding mystery smoking high cholesterol and lack of exercise should drive disease to develop evenly throughout all blood vessels but in reality atherosclerotic lesions tend to cluster where vessels branch
7717733 our study provides new insight into why and suggests how the protection afforded by the force of steady flow and simple stretch might be strengthened with drugs
7717734 we are encouraged that the results of the japanese and u s studies are consistent and both suggest that nitric oxide donation may allow a more sustained intraocular pressure lowering effect nicox and pfizer are in active discussions regarding the worldwide rights to pf 03187207 which we believe has a certain commercial potential which should be realized we are also pleased by the progress that has been made in the research program focused on diabetic retinopathy where we hope a lead compound will be selected in the first half of next year
7717735 i can understand why the party wants to just call it close and paper over it but i want to vote for her
7717736 maybe if we didnt get our voice vote maybe then id certainly be angry id be very angry
7717737 but where im from there are lots of people lots of working class people she really connected with
7717738 i dont know who you are but i figure i should at least youre british
7717739 she could go on to a long career in the senate like robert byrd she could become a justice on the supreme court
7717740 knowing her as i do she loves what she does in the senate she really does
7717741 dont forget bill and hillary clinton have experience in that making appointments quickly
7717742 if hes not she has a shot in four years
7717743 i knitted in environmental studies class and i had my moccasins
7717744 we are decidedly not interested in just thinking smart thoughts and hoping someone cares
7717745 the specific goal of the organization was to be bipartisan to not be post partisan nonpartisan or trans partisan
7717746 but to actually have republicans and democrats who believe in the core issues of their party but also believe that washington can function better when it comes to legislating
7717747 so many of these commissions end when reports get sent to the printer
7717748 i told you sukhlal it is spirit not strength that makes a team
7717749 ive been a big supporter major supporter of unions virtually all my life
7717750 all statistics indicate for the last 35 years is that the main salary for the union worker has remained stagnant we have to talk about issues around living wage issues about heath care and issues about pension and retirement and unions have been the most avid advocates for those issues and thats why i support any union
7717751 i lived in the projects of san francisco for the first 11 years of my life i had a health care system because my parents worked at the post office
7717752 they took our pensions it wasnt right so were trying to find somebody to take their place to help us win the fight for the working people
7717753 thank you for contacting jetblue airways regarding your recent experience we are disappointed to hear of the ordeal you and your family had to go through last week there is no way we can fully appreciate how frustrating and stressful the delays must have been for you please accept our sincerest apology for any inconvenience on this occasion we realize you had a lot to deal with and will do our best to address all of your concerns
7717754 despite turbulent markets our investment and development divisions were able to produce stable income streams demonstrating the quality of the investment portfolio and the strong demand for our leading residential products outgoing chief executive greg paramor said
7717755 while we are in a constrained residential market across australia investors and homebuyers are continuing to support quality residential developments as evidenced by our record sales achievements in queensland and western australia
7717756 our results and recent announcements to the market show that mirvac is a robust organisation that is able to adapt to changed market conditions
7717757 residential developments have been exposed to the continuing poor sentiment affordability and mortgage related stress which adversely impacted some development values mirvac said
7717758 i know theres frustration and it would make my job easier if i could give out the facts that i know but we have obligations to our partners we discuss it constantly and the company would like to be more upfront about this but we cant be
7717759 when i found we had this problem i went to the oems and said lets fix this
7717760 in fact i put a reserve of 200m in place and i said to the oems if you fix it ill pay you back
7717761 not marvell not broadcom not amd but if the consumer has a failure well get it replaced right away
7717762 the first person in the world that talked about this problem was me
7717763 i put out the first press release and ill stand up and be partly responsible
7717764 it hasnt shipped so we cant really talk about it and by the time it does ship nvidias technology will be far advanced
7717765 we believe the mobile device will become the next personal computer look at the iphone were seeing it happen directly in front of us
7717766 smartphones will become a computer first and a phone second in the next several years well realise that weve gone through a second pc revolution
7717767 i believe that windows mobile 7 is going to be really amazing it takes an enormous effort for us to support that platform in all its permutations but thats our strategy
7717768 the nano is a really terrific cpu and you put nano with geforce together and everything works blu ray dx 10 games its low cost it consumes very little power its unbelievable
7717769 that were going to optimise all our software for nano and carry out compatibility testing for all nano platforms so any time you have a nano platform you can put a geforce in it and itll just work
7717770 so that companies can say were in the visual computing business and people will understand what that means
7717771 but also companies working in consumer electronics film photography and industrial design
7717772 wed have been delighted for intel and amd to be here
7717773 next year theyre going to want to be part of it and well be delighted for them to be

7717886 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and for me our country will be committed to his cause the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on

7717900 mccain showed up for 44 percent of the votes last year
7717901 students get along just fine without a car on campus even in the winter months
7717902 with expanded alternative transportation methods in place now and others planned for the coming year we believe first year student transportation needs can be met quite adequately as we reduce the environmental impact parking difficulties and congestion caused by additional cars
7717903 we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7717904 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7717905 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7717906 all of you are aware of the serious nature of this years fire season and the issues faced by the agency in paying for fire suppression costs
7717907 at this time the only option for financing the shortfall is to use the agencys transfer authority
7717908 the unfortunate thing is that it is across the board
7717909 i recognize that this direction will have a significant effect on agency operations
7717910 however we must be in a position to protect life and property from wildfire and do so within the funds available to the agency
7717911 the fire season in montana and across the country is far from over not to mention we have good paying jobs to fund and projects around the state that need to be completed
7717912 funding should not be pulled from our states resources to help pay for fighting fires in california
7717913 god willing we will perform well we will manage against all odds unless there is massive rigging any independent observer will concede we have an edge
7717914 capable of bringing change that will benefit the people regardless of race
7717915 i think its a test of who protects the malay interests the most to which party will they entrust the political future

7717918 you might hear thats a good looking boy id trade you a pocket knife for him political correctness has ruined country humor
7717919 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7717920 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7717921 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7717922 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7717923 the nomination is decided we have a vice president we will work together to go forward every convention has its areas of disagreement to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7717924 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7717925 i ask each and every one of you to work as hard for barack and joe biden as you worked for me
7717926 i have done more in the past two months than people in my position historically have done and i will keep doing it
7717927 with the economic situation worsening and the property market still suffering we are calling on the government to take urgent action on hips we have long seen hips as not fit for purpose and as the wrong answer to simplifying the house buying process quite simply the government tried to force square pegs into round holes and the slower property market is making this situation worse
7717928 hips are already bringing benefits to consumers by providing important information to help families cut their fuel bills and carbon emissions and have reduced the price of property searches by increasing transparency in the home buying and selling process
7717929 we like his instincts and his ability to run a team he also puts a lot of pressure on the ball
7717930 migrant workers can bring enormous benefits to local businesses and areas however many of these contributions such as new ideas and ways of working and an entrepreneurial spirit may have been neglected in the past

7717935 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans our country will be committed to his cause the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7717936 i think this is his final hurrah to the party his final gift to the party
7717937 this was his way to maybe help quell a mini revolt among the delegates he likes barack obama and hes worried about the clinton factor hes now going to be the story of this convention at least until obama gives his acceptance speech and this should completely silence whatever dissension exists
7717938 may have accomplished more in the senate than some presidents did in the white house
7717939 but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most this is one of those moments
7717940 hes the last link to that promising new frontier generation of the 1960s when the world seemed pliable when we were going to make the world a better place when we were going to battle poverty and racism and fight for peace
7717941 to lose him is going to be painful it will feel like were losing those dreams of making the world a better place

7717947 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7717948 for all those whose cares have been our concern the work goes on the cause endures the hope still lives and the dream shall never die
7717949 i have seen barack obama in the senate ive been by his side campaigning in diners and coffee shops i know he will bring the change we need in washington
7717950 i saw him take on both parties to help pass the farthest reaching ethics reform since watergate thats the change we need
7717951 i saw him run a campaign that hasnt taken a dime from federal lobbyists or pacs thats the change we need
7717952 i know this son of a single mom will stand up for the dreams of our daughters and i know that john mccain wont
7717953 there is only one candidate in this race who has fought for equal pay for equal work by americas women that candidate is barack obama
7717954 i have seen barack obama bring people together democrats republicans and independents young and old he makes us believe once more in the very best of america
7717955 barack obama is going to be one great president a great president for one great nation one nation under god with liberty and justice for all

7718007 liverpool are close to concluding rafael ben tezs search for a left sided midfielder having yesterday made an improved offer for the espanyol winger
7718008 there is a team which is offering what we have asked and another one which isnt but the player is interested in the one which is offering the least we will not lower our asking price
7718009 could not be trying any harder than he is to make the move to liverpool happen
7718010 he will learn a lot from benitez and he knows how serious the liverpool manager is although he knows he is going to have to work very hard
7718011 hey its kim the pediatric orthopedist is here can you come back like right now

7718021 and while there are no doubt some in moskva who would like to see russia resume a strong and independent role in the near east such as the out of power yevgenii primakov for example it is doubtful that such individuals hold much sway in moskva at the moment indeed
7718022 former prime minister heads to syria and iran and says russia has a lot to offer the arab sic world
7718023 if we think renewables are going to solve our energy dependency thats an incredible mistake
7718024 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
7718025 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
7718026 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
7718027 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
7718028 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
7718029 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
7718030 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
7718031 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
7718032 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
7718033 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
7718034 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
7718035 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
7718036 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
7718037 durante nuestra convenci n vamos a demostrar a todos los estadounidenses por qu necesitamos a barack obama y joe biden en la casa blanca

7718050 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
7718051 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
7718052 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
7718053 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
7718054 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
7718055 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
7718056 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
7718057 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
7718058 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
7718059 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
7718060 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
7718061 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
7718062 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
7718063 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
7718064 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
7718065 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
7718066 f or joe biden to talk about qualifications hes never run a city hes never run a state hes never run a business
7718067 i dont have to debate you because everyone already knows im right
7718068 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
7718069 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance
7718070 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7718071 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7718072 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7718073 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7718074 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7718075 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7718076 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7718077 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
7718078 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme

7718081 we believe that coal use will increase under any foreseeable scenario because it is cheap and abundant
7718082 should and will take actions to reduce the emissions of co2 and other greenhouse gas emissions

7718088 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
7718089 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
7718090 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7718091 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
7718092 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
7718093 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
7718094 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
7718095 moreover since bill is not and has not been for years gainfully employed he will be scrounging around for cash everywhere but that wouldnt be exactly new would it
7718096 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
7718097 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
7718098 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
7718099 if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us

7718120 honouring american values a belief in personal responsibility in community in hard work
7718121 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect
7718122 we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7718123 i have come here to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and elect barack obama president of the united states
7718124 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7718125 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them most

7718148 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty

7718150 wir sind es den patienten schuldig dass wir auch bei medizinprodukten den sicherheitsstandard anstreben den wir bei arzneimitteln l ngst erreicht haben

7718152 i think well lose another half million jobs and possibly another million
7718153 the man who reads nothing at all is better educated than the man who reads nothing but newspapers
7718154 our growth is tied to the success of our artists in making kerchoonz the community to find music
7718155 we see our relationship with them as a partnership and want them to benefit from our success its simply a question of fairness

7718160 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7718161 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7718162 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7718163 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day

7718169 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7718170 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950

7718174 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
7718175 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7718176 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7718177 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7718178 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to
7718179 make people aware of the kind of sacrifice barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope
7718180 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7718181 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way

7718187 n s estamos revendo nossa rela o inteira com a r ssia
7718188 s o um assunto para apenas um pa s resolver
7718189 im netz geht es vor allem darum die br cke zwischen der grundlagenforschung und der versorgungsforschung zu schlagen
7718190 die grundlagenforschung hat exzellente leistungen aufzuweisen zum beispiel ansatzpunkte f r die medikation aber nichts ist bisher in der praxis angekommen
7718191 wir m ssen den gesellschaftspolitischen und den gesundheitspolitischen herausforderungen durch die demenzen etwas entgegenstellen
7718192 ziel des netzes ist es ber eine gute grundlagenforschung zur klinischen anwendung und zur therapeutischen entwicklung zu gelangen
7718193 es gibt einige neue therapieans tze um an der ursache der erkrankung anzusetzen
7718194 man sollte aber vorsichtig sein und abwarten was die weiteren studien bringen um patienten nicht zu viel hoffnung zu machen
7718195 im actually actually getting feedback from people that they are thinking about buying another unit for investment purposes
7718196 his shirts fly out of our store i love the characters and quality of fabric
7718197 when robert said he had a new t shirt line i wanted to be one of the first to carry it people come here for something new something different and urban
7718198 the location will give the entire student population direct access to the tennis courts
7718199 it does not just benefit athletics it benefits the entire campus community
7718200 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7718201 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7718202 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7718203 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7718204 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7718205 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7718206 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7718207 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7718208 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7718209 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7718210 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7718211 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7718212 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7718213 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7718214 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7718215 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7718216 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7718217 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7718218 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7718219 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7718220 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7718221 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7718222 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7718223 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7718224 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7718225 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7718226 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7718227 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7718228 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7718229 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7718230 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7718231 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7718232 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7718233 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7718234 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7718235 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7718236 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7718237 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7718238 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7718239 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7718240 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7718241 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7718242 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7718243 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7718244 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7718245 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7718246 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7718247 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7718248 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7718249 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7718250 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7718251 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7718252 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator

7718257 est acontecendo exatamente como na campanha de jaques wagner quando iniciamos o hor rio eleitoral com o mesmo percentual
7718258 se trata de un juego al inicio de la temporada y en todo caso fue mejor perder ahora que un momento m s clave ya que ahora podemos pelear por seis puntos
7718259 el nimo del equipo est bien porque todos estamos conscientes que debemos mejorar pero lo m s importante es que estamos en tiempo de recuperarnos de esta derrota de mejorar nuestro juego para sacar los puntos y dejar atr s ese partido con el puebla
7718260 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7718261 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7718262 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7718263 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7718264 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7718265 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7718266 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7718267 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7718268 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7718269 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7718270 were trying to focus on all the creative talent we have in detroit
7718271 the industry is here the jobs are here but the people need to be trained for them
7718272 we want to work with wayne state to establish a degree program
7718273 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7718274 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7718275 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified

7718282 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7718283 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7718284 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7718285 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7718286 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7718287 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7718288 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7718289 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7718290 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7718291 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7718292 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7718293 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7718294 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7718295 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7718296 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection

7718307 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7718308 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7718309 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7718310 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7718311 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7718312 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7718313 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7718314 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7718315 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7718316 have you ever wanted to violate section 13 1 of the canadian human rights act but been unsure where to start
7718317 see in my line of work you got to keep repeating things over and over and over again for the truth to sink in to kind of catapult the propaganda
7718318 america was never innocent we popped our cherry on the boat over and looked back with no regrets you cant ascribe our fall from grace to any single event or set of circumstances you cant lose what you lacked at conception
7718319 mass market nostalgia gets you hopped up for a past that never existed hagiography sanctifies shuck and jive politicians and reinvents their expedient gestures as moments of great moral weight our continuing narrative line is blurred past truth and hindsight only a reckless verisimilitude can set that line straight
7718320 one of his most famous songs i know youre very familiar with gasolina
7718321 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7718322 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7718323 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7718324 its so great to see so much support we are proud of this accomplishment as volleyball players but also proud to be americans it is great to have such a sense of pride in our nation
7718325 its hard to go to war without your leader we felt complete when he came back
7718326 we have couple of plans and we hope that our players would be playing some international cricket next month
7718327 the postponement of champions trophy is a body blow to pakistan but since the country is run by the wrong people i see more trouble for cricket in pakistan
7718328 the event is postponed until next year but if the current government trying to outdo musharraf stays i fear the situation could worsen rather than improve
7718329 at least we did not lose the hosting rights and in the present circumstances i think it was the right decision to delay the tournament for one year

7718332 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7718333 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7718334 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7718335 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7718336 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7718337 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
7718338 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7718339 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7718340 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
7718341 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7718342 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7718343 there used to be an organization for people who believed in a truly limited government limited taxes limited spending limited interference in individual lives and limited intervention in foreign affairs that organization was known as the republican party but the only one of those beliefs that still motivates the g o p establishment is limited taxes

7718363 i think it is great to see two guys on top of their games and bringing the best out of each other

7718384 i had a mini stroke a while back my short term memory goes in and out see i did remember you after all
7718385 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7718386 nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight theres a new wave of change all around us and if we set our compass true we will reach our destination not merely victory for our party but renewal for our nation
7718387 my daughter did this to me because i hurt the mother
7718388 i have to pray five times a day for what i have done

7718391 the kiwi has been hit very hard and the aussie has gone along for the ride
7718392 i cant see any blue sky at the moment i cant see any valid reason why youd really want to be buying the aussie at the moment
7718393 the aussie has a good reason to be down here
7718394 theres not a lot of positive news out there for the aussie at the moment not enough to counter this down move
7718395 number one they need to import a large amount of wheat
7718396 if they need wheat right now the us is the place to go
7718397 the idea of that in 2000 was to promote certain types of exports to sanctioned countries so there would be food medicine agricultural products medical products
7718398 it is still surprising that they are buying wheat from the us instead of waiting to buy wheat from someone else
7718399 maybe the relationship between iran and the us is not as terrible as it has been
7718400 iran is more interested in showing to its people that it is not restrained by sanctions
7718401 the real signal is look were doing fine we can buy wheat from the us
7718402 this is a serious setback for iran from a domestic point of view because they made a big deal about self sufficiency in grains
7718403 prime is poised to deliver a strong ratings performance in this period and capture a dominant revenue share in its markets notwithstanding a tightening in broader market conditions
7718404 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and me our country will be committed to his cause
7718405 the work will begin anew the hope will rise again and the dream lives on
7718406 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future and to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7718407 barack obama and edward m kennedy their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7718408 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7718409 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7718410 i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world
7718411 we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7718412 let there be no mistake about it we are united
7718413 hillary wants us to support obama the same we supported her and thats what we are gonna do
7718414 i feel pretty good about my chances especially now that ive got one of the finest statesmen in this country on my ticket joe biden as vice president
7718415 when you win in three sets it is a good results
7718416 i had some difficult moments in the match so that is going to help me be prepared for the pressure moments later on
7718417 i was trying to stay focussed as well as i could
7718418 its a matter of how fresh i can stay for this tournament
7718419 i want to get some rest and make sure i dont practise as much as i did in beijing i need to save some energy for this tournament
7718420 i tried to keep my level up i tried to hurry him
7718421 he was hitting his forehand really hard and making me do a bit of running
7718422 it was a decent test and i came through it pretty well
7718423 there have been some great performances from a lot of players this year but we dont have anything like justine who was able to win every single tournament
7718424 in the first set i felt like i was playing against a wall
7718425 in the second set i told myself to just play your game and dont give up
7718426 given such a strong decline on wall street you are going to get declines in our market
7718427 we will probably finish in the red today maybe something over one to one and a half per cent
7718428 anz have taken steps to clear out people who were in charge of some of the key areas in the last few year
7718429 maybe that is causing a positive view on anz as they have been cut back substantially in the last month or so

7718532 too few students scored above the 95th percentile to compute reliable statistics for these groups american indians hispanics and black not hispanic
7718533 if a particular specialty required mathematical skills at the 99th percentile and the gender ratio is 2 0 we would expect 67 men in the occupation and 33 women yet today for example ph d programs in engineering average only about 15 women
7718534 what do we mean by diversity in science and engineering anyway
7718535 what exactly do i want to do in this new field anyway

7718557 id heard it from a pretty good source last night but everyone was thrilled to hear about it at our breakfast this is the kind of moment that sen kennedy lives for
7718558 id heard something over the weekend but his health is such an issue it wasnt clear if hed be able to come
7718559 im a cancer survivor and i know how draining this kind of thing can be
7718560 is truly humbled by the outpouring of support and wouldnt miss it for anything in the world
7718561 not only will everybody in our delegation be on their feet when he comes out everybody will be standing on their seat
7718562 this is important for the convention because of all that hes meant to our party over the years
7718563 it pushes the focus back on the challenge ahead and on obama and the race it gives people something positive to talk about
7718564 this may be ted kennedys final gift to the party
7718565 this says that he feels this is the democrats year and the party is not as unified as hed like it to be his appearance takes the headlines away from the clinton faction
7718566 happens to be somebody who i love to death hes just a good man and obviously hes going through a difficult time but im glad that we can use this convention to remind people of the contributions hes made to this country
7718567 the greatest legacy kennedy would want would be an obama victory in november
7718568 for all those whose cares have been our concern the work goes on the cause endures the hope still lives and the dream shall never die
7718569 you could see it as the word spread around town today from person to person
7718570 just charges the atmosphere here the emotion is enormous its just what you want to start off the convention

7718577 im not among those that has concluded that changing the drinking age is what needs to be done i am one of those who feels the issue needs to be studied that there needs to be a national conversation about it
7718578 alcohol use is an incredible problem in our society but it particularly affects the college campuses because our primary group is in the 18 to 23 24 year old age group where this transition is occurring i looked over the focus and intent and it seemed to me appropriate as a higher education leader to say not only does higher education but the larger society needs a conversation about this
7718579 we welcome an honest discussion and that begins with a clear discussion of the science
7718580 we are hopeful that that will be the focus going forward
7718581 were not burying our head and trying to hide behind laws

7718654 supporters of the right to keep and bear arms have long recognized the value of firearms for the defense of life liberty and property but in florida a perverse conception of the 2nd amendment has produced the opposite effect the cause of gun rights is being used to attack property rights in 1987 florida wisely affirmed personal freedom by letting law abiding citizens get permits to carry concealed weapons but this year the legislature decided it was not enough to let licensees pack in public places they also should be allowed to take their guns into private venues even if the property owner objects the take your guns to work law says anyone with a conceal carry permit has a legal right to keep his gun locked in his car in the company parking lot until recently companies had the authority to make the rules on their own premises but when it comes to guns that freedom is defunct

7718684 big picture and their own roles in the war against terror it offers a clear comprehensive and fascinating overview of this increasingly complicated topic divided into three main sections
7718685 obama favors leaving between 35 000 and 80 000 u
7718686 god loves harlots he loves swindlers and crooks and whoremongerers certainly not god is too good to love such as those
7718687 greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends
7718688 that is love he did not call down fire from heaven to consume them there was nothing but love in his heart
7718689 greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends
7718690 the love of god is not only something we need it is the reason we were made god loved us into existence god saw us before we were born and out of his love declared that we ought to be everything that exists came into being by the love of god we were made to be loved
7718691 some of us are so afraid that gods not going to look at us so were out there doing all sorts of things to get god to take notice but folks god notices you the fact is he cant take his eyes off of you however badly you think of yourself god is crazy about you god is in love with you

7718695 memory operated at room temperature and with only a single layer quantum dot layer is important because it can be used in every day life
7718696 room temperature memory operation of a single inas quantum dot layer in a gaas algaas heterostructure
7718697 low temperatures were needed with single layer quantum dot our idea was to create a system that could work under increased temperatures otherwise you always have to put your samples in cryostats and use long wirings this makes it harder to extract all the information you want
7718698 from this structure field emission is reduced drastically and we are able to observe the memory effect at room temperature
7718699 the trick here is that the material does not match directly to the gallium arsenide you do not have to structure them
7718700 you cannot say in a lateral field where they are placed
7718701 through etching making small holes at pre defined sites it turns out that indium arsenide growth can be controlled laterally

7718713 the challenge they the government have for very low cost access and under sixes funding is because they want practices to agree to capped fee charges the government funding component of the revenue for these practices is very high and it has to be adjusted in a way that accurately reflects the cost increases for general practice
7718714 they had to increase the funding to the point where practices wouldnt leave the scheme
7718715 it doesnt alter our view of the world that accepting capped fees is a risky business

7718756 ik heb de sugababes altijd leuk gevonden vooral het feit dat ze live zingen ik heb veel respect voor ze en ben altijd een grote fan geweest
7718757 ik ben voor het eerst in amsterdam en its lovely hier ik heb alleen nog niet veel rond gekeken dat ben ik van plan om morgen te gaan doen
7718758 ik had een erg leuke tijd tijdens het opnemen van de videoclip je kon je lekker verkleden en optutten het was totaal iets anders dan dat ik normaal deed ik had erg leuke dagen
7718759 ik begin er nu een beetje aan te wennen in het begin was ik altijd erg zenuwachtig ook de eerste optredens waren zenuwslopend het gaat langzaam aan steeds beter
7718760 ik begon echt te huilen en trillen volgens mij ik kreeg zowat een hartaanval zo een schok was het voor mij ik ben echt heel blij en voel mij vereerd mijn droom is uitgekomen
7718761 niet echt je vergeet als je eenmaal als artiest bezig bent alles om je heen alles gaat zo snel maar het doet me nog steeds wel veel als ik eraan denk
7718762 ja ik kan me heel goed voorstellen hoe amelle zich nu voelt maar natuurlijk ook hoe keisha zich voelde toen ik nieuw bij de sugababes kwam wat vooral bij mij en keisha geldt is dat we amelle graag willen steunen als ze hulp met iets nodig heeft weet ze aan wie ze het kan vragen
7718763 ik ben de grootste dramaqueen van allemaal en zou ook graag willen acteren

7718766 ik heb don een jaar geleden leren kennen via zijn manager
7718767 haha ik en het was meer zijn nek op een gegeven moment zing ik een stukje hey boy wanna see my body wanna lick your body dus dacht ik laten we daad bij het woord voegen alle commotie erom heen is me eigenlijk een beetje ontgaan alle ophef is nergens voor nodig mijn vriend was zelfs bij de opnames
7718768 guniang is chinees voor meisje het nummer gaat over een meisje dat verlaten is door een jongen en wilt daar eigenlijk overheen schreeuwen dat ze hem niet toch niet hoeft bij deze single doen we vooral veel radiopromotie en interviews bij deze single is besloten om geen clip op te nemen we willen bij de volgende single echt uitpakken en het is ook een geldverhaal het lukt niet om bij elk nummer zoals vroeger mooie videoclips op te nemen het gaat namelijk over bedragen waar je gewoon een album voor kan maken wij gaan het nu proberen zonder clip ik breng het in eigen beheer uit en heb me veel bezig gehouden met het hele marketing gebeuren ik schrok daarbij van de kijkcijfers van bijvoorbeeld tmf dat is gemiddeld per uur 4000 mensen dat is zo laag en je verkijkt je echt op de kijkcijfers van regionale zenders dat zijn echt honderdduizenden dus we gaan veel regionaal promoten
7718769 nee ik wil me vooral blijven verdiepen in zingen en acteren en presenteren doe ik dan alleen bepaalde dingen een programma als countdown zou ik zo weer doen en reisprogrammas lijken me ook leuk maar dan wel met een meer culturele of muzikale insteek zo de wereld rond reizen lijkt me een leuke manier van werken ik neem nog steeds acteer en zanglessen ik doe ook steeds meer dingen buiten mijn straatje ik vind het interessant om me te verdiepen in andermans liedjes in musicals ben je bezig met zingend acteren een gevoel overbrengen terwijl je het niet zelf hebt geschreven ik vind het gewoon leuk om met veel verschillende dingen bezig te zijn
7718770 nee niet echt maar ik zie het meer als een concert waarbij ik artiesten introduceer het is eigenlijk iets heel kleins ik interview geen mensen ik ga zelf ook een intiem optreden geven in het melkweg caf om 17 00 uur voor onder andere de winnaars van de wella wedstrijd
7718771 ik vind de line up erg gevarieerd ik ben niet echt met alle artiesten even bekend dus ben zelf ook erg benieuwd naar de avond yes r vind ik leuk hij is erg aardig en beleefd
7718772 nou gisteravond had ik een presentatie van de vader van mijn vriend hij heeft een boek geschreven over de nederlandse operazanger john br cheler toen kwam een oudere vrouw naar me toe en zei dat het een eer was dat zij mij kende en ze vroeg of ik wel veel werk had stond ik daar dan en vroeg me af waar de toiletten waren en ik liep een keer op de markt en kwam een dertigjarige man naar me toe en hij vroeg waarom ik op de markt liep ik deed gewoon boodschappen en wat ook erg cool is is dat de jongen die mij website maakt stephan sneeuw de albumtitel van mijn eerste album few like me op zijn rug getatoe erd heeft
7718773 nee ik doe heel veel zelf bij mijn laatste video was wel een styliste venus waterman ik vind het erg leuk om bezig te zijn met kleding mode is een interessant iets om je karakter mee te versterken naar de buitenwereld ik krijg veel van diesel g sus insight en chick on a mission maar ik vind het ook heerlijk om tweedehands winkeltjes af te struinen of spullen te kopen via ebay zo heb ik ooit eens een prachtige zwarte jurk voor tien dollar gekocht via ebay verder draag ik graag kleding van nederlandse ontwerpers het jasje in de clip van whos your daddy is bijvoorbeeld van daryl van wouw qua stijl vind ik gwen stefani er altijd goed uitzien van die hele hype van sienna miller snapte ik niks ik vind haar namelijk niet echt iets speciaals hebben
7718774 er zit een leuke winkel op de zeedijk in amsterdam kenkichi heet dat ze verkopen veel van nederlandse ontwerpers net als de winkel ydu young designers united ze verkopen veel enkele stuks op de nieuwezijds voorburgwal zit open its a shop en dat is ook een leuk winkeltje ik ga volgende week naar new york en heb de laatste tijd weinig uitgegeven want ik wil daar graag naar de winkels van agent provocateur en anna sui ik hoop wel dat het dan sale is ik vind ook h amp m leuk maar meer voor de basisdingen want als je iets opvallends hebt en je ziet iemand anders ermee weet je meteen dat het van de h amp m komt ik probeer dat dan daarom altijd te combineren met iets van mijzelf
7718775 1000 euro is niet echt veel voor je het weet is het op ik heb het moeten delen met dj kesh en soesie b ik kon het in die tijd wel goed gebruiken ik zat toen nog bij d men en dat was nog redelijk underground alles wat ik per optreden kon krijgen was meegenomen ik zat ook nog op school ik ben eigenlijk pas goed gaan verdienen na mijn platencontract die kreeg ik kort na de grote prijs finale
7718776 ik ben niet wezen kijken want ik moest zelf optreden maar ik heb wel meegekregen wie er heeft gewonnen het jaar dat ik meedeed won typhoon de grote prijs en jawat won dit jaar de grote prijs en het is wel grappig dat de winnaars beiden uit zwolle komen
7718777 ik was eigenlijk twaalf toen ik het rappen echt ontdekte zo rond mijn vijftiende was ik aan het twijfelen of ik verder zou gaan met rappen of voetballen school was niks voor mij daar ging ik alleen heen om dat het moest van mijn ouders met rappen was ik net een stukje beter en ben toen op advies van mijn neef ali b naar talentenjachten geweest de eerste keer deed ik met negativ mee met de kunstbende en was direct uitgeschakeld ik was toen zo teleurgesteld en heb het daarop volgende jaar alleen maar teksten lopen schrijven na schooltijd en deed opnieuw weer mee en die keer had ik terecht gewonnen daarna deed ik mee aan most wanted en eindige als tweede toen kwam de grote prijs van nederland
7718778 ja absoluut want eigenlijk alles wat hij heeft gedaan heb ik zo een beetje gevolgd ik mag hem dan ook echt dankbaar zijn voor veel dingen zoals het nummer leipe mocro flavour bestond al en ik mocht mee doen op die remix en dat werd een mega hit leipe mocro flavour stond een hele tijd op nummer 2 in de top 40 we konden guus meeuwis net niet van die nummer 1 positie halen en ik kreeg een tijd geleden een aanbod om een nummer op te nemen met akon ik mag hem dus voor veel dingen bedanken en dat is denk ik ook een zegen van boven
7718779 akon heeft veel te maken met universal records en ali b en ik doen de publishing via universal ali b is een groot fan van akon universal heeft akon benaderd dat een grote nederlandse rapper met hem wou samenwerken akon wilde wat van hem horen dus ali heeft zijn album gestuurd en hij was direct enthousiast ik hoorde dat later en moest en zou op die track want sinds ik zijn album trouble heb gehoord was ik in n klap fan toen akon die remix van leipe mocro flavour had gehoord en vond hij dat ik er ook bij moest na zijn show in rotterdam hebben we gelijk die volgende dag de videoclip voor de ghetto remix in de bijlmer opgenomen akon is echt een toffe gast en heeft ons uitgenodigd om een keer naar amerika te komen ali belt hem ook regelmatig ik hoop we in de toekomst vaker kunnen samenwerken
7718780 dat is eigenlijk heel moeilijk te zeggen diegene die mij de eerste stapjes van het rappen heeft geleerd is toch ali vooral toen ik een tijdje in almere buiten woonde toen ik weer verhuisde richting amsterdam oost leerde ik soesi b kennen en samen leerden wij lange frans en de rest van d men kennen hij zag dat ik echt talent had en gaf mij de kans om mee te rappen op straatremixes dankzij frans ben ik in de underground bekend geworden ik kan moeilijk zeggen dat ik door frans ontdekt ben want als ik hem nooit had ontmoet had iemand anders wel mijn talent gespot misschien had het dan wat langer geduurd maar sowieso zou ik er komen het contact met lange frans is nu niet verbitterd ofzo we waren toen gewoon erg close maar frans vond het niet leuk dat ik bij ali had getekend hij heeft in een nummer gezegd dat ik ondankbaar was en daar heb ik toen weer opgereageerd waarvan ik achteraf vond dat dat niet had gehoeven maar we zijn nu volwassen en bezig met onze eigen dingen ik gun hem zijn succes en ik sluit absoluut niet buiten dat ik zeker ga knallen dit jaar
7718781 ja eminem hij heeft de illste flow en heeft altijd wat te zeggen in zijn teksten men zeurt wel dat hij het vaak heeft over zijn vrouw en dochter maar dat scoort nu eenmaal het is ook zeker mijn droom om met hem en jay z samen te werken met akon wilde ik ook graag iets doen en dat is nu al werkelijkheid geworden ik heb eigenlijk geen ambities om in amerika door te breken want ik spreek geen vloeiend engels belgi zou ik al heel wat vinden
7718782 het was al bijna zeker dat ik een rol zou krijgen en ik had ook heel graag mee willen doen maar mijn management en de producent van de film zijn het niet eens geworden om verschillende redenen
7718783 ja absoluut als mensen mij vragen wat ik naast rappen zou willen doen is dat zeker acteren ik wil sowieso een film maken die gebaseerd is op mijn leven net zoiets als eminem en 50 cent hebben gedaan ook lijkt het me leuk om totaal iemand anders te spelen in een film en wie weet zie je me wel ooit in goede tijden slechte tijden
7718784 heel leuk eddy zo y is echt een toffe gast het is jammer dat het nummer geen knallende hit is geworden maar daar gingen we ook eigenlijk niet voor we vonden het gewoon grappig om met elkaar samen te werken omdat we beiden zo verschillend zijn in onze muziek ik heb echt veel met hem gelachen in de studio en zou het zo weer over doen
7718785 nee niet echt ik ben gewoon hetzelfde als in het dagelijkse leven alleen nu misschien wat professioneler omdat ik met mijn werk bezig ben ik ben gewoon een grapjas en houd van een beetje pesten enzo ik vind dat je vooral jezelf moet blijven het succes kan allemaal zo voorbij zijn
7718786 veel optredens en ik ga mijn album mijn pad nog verder promoten ik ben wel bezig met mijn tweede album dat wordt een yes r en soesie b album ik breng rond februari de single mammie van het album mijn pad uit met brace
7718787 the xtracpads hammer is another new mouse pad from the xtracpads series its a harder surface and it offers the hexagonal pattern for increased sensitivity for better mouse tracking it also offers a much bigger surface than any hard surface from xtracpads before and its much thinner as well making it almost a part of your desk
7718788 since the beginning of times intel cpus use an external bus called front side bus or simply fsb that is shared between memory and i o requests the next generation of intel cpus will have an embedded memory controller and thus will provide two external busses a memory bus for connecting the cpu to the memory and an i o bus to connect the cpu to the external world this bus is a new bus called quickpath interconnect qpi and in this tutorial we will be explaining how it works
7718789 vesteda dat zat gewoon erg goed in elkaar en alles was perfect het team waarmee ik werkte bestond uit allemaal vrienden en vriendinnen de sfeer is heel belangrijk om goed te presteren voor de camera
7718790 er is een keer verkeerde make up gebruikt voor mijn gezicht waar ik erg allergisch op reageerde allemaal rode vlekken waren her eindresultaat ik ben nog nooit gevallen met een modeshow ik loop namelijk altijd op pumps of laarzen met een hak dat werkt in mijn voordeel mij zal je nooit op gympen zien alleen met sporten
7718791 ik moest een keer voor mijn werk een week naar portugal voor een fotoshoot en we hadden een model te weinig toen heb ik een vriendin voorgesteld en zij is toen mee geweest ze had geen ervaring maar na een dag veranderde ze al helemaal in een queen met een vreselijke attitude ik kan veel hebben maar zij heeft er echt een rampweek van gemaakt na thuiskomst waren we vanzelfsprekend ook geen vriendinnen meer
7718792 vroeg opstaan ik heb gelukkig niet zoveel slaap nodig dan yoga oefeningen want je weet maar nooit in welke positie je uren moet gaan staan of liggen daarna naar de studio of de locatie meestal ben je gelijk aan de beurt bij de visagiste en neem je samen met de styliste de kleding door en pas je ze dan een gesprek met de fotograaf om te weten wat de sfeer moet zijn en wat er van je verwacht gaat worden je gaat voor de camera staan en doet je ding meestal is daar veel wachttijd bij gemoeid
7718793 nee ik heb geen vriendinnen die ook model zijn alle vriendinnen die ik om mij heen heb ken ik al 10 jaar en zij kennen mij zoals ik ben als persoon en hebben ook alle fases meegemaakt in mijn leven het is heel uniek als je over een vriendinnengroep beschikt van acht meiden die al in ieder geval zes jaar bij elkaar zijn heerlijk
7718794 ik vind beiden even leuk ik denk persoonlijk dat ik meer ervaring heb met fotoshoots en dan in highfashion want ik ben niet het girl nextdoor type en wordt daar dus nooit voor gevraagd catwalk is heerlijk als er goede muziek bij wordt gedraaid
7718795 ik zie er graag mooi en verzorgd uit maar ik ben totaal niet het type voor verzorgingsproducten ik was mijn gezicht voors ochtends en het slapen gaan met water en smeer al jaren alleen nivea soft op mijn huid ik gebruik bijna geen make up ik ben wel dol op kleding tassen en schoenen maar ach welke vrouw niet
7718796 weet je pluspunten uit te buiten dus kijk naar jezelf op fotos of in de spiegel en kijk wat je sterke kant is als je van jongs af aan al weet dat je model wilt worden en je wordt niet gescout op straat wat de beste manier is zorg dan voor mooie fotos en stort je dan op meerdere modellenbureau kijk op het internet welke de beste zijn er zijn namelijk ook flash bureaus wees hierop alert kijk in glossybladen als vogue en vanity fair naar poses van meisjes en probeer je zo beter te profileren als je model wilt worden moet dat je drijfveer zijn in je leven ik heb dat eigenlijk niet ik was gewoon op het juiste moment op de juiste plaats vandaar dat ik model ben
7718797 het draait om twee verhalen de leidraad is niet het bolletjesslikken wat veel mensen zullen denken maar een liefdesrelaties tussen spike en rosalie hij wordt verliefd op haar maar heeft weinig geld daar schaamt hij zich voor en om dat te camoufleren wilt hij geld verdienen komt hij terecht in een gang en gaat bolletjes slikken
7718798 ik heb nog nooit echt in een film geacteerd dus het leek mij sowieso een leuke rol het is ook geen rol die heel ver weg van me staat kijk ik ben geen bolletjesslikker maar het verhaal speelt zich af in de grote stad en met rap en gangs ik denk dat we allemaal zijn gecast op dat we niet ver van de types af staan die we moeten spelen het spelen ging me wel gemakkelijk af maar ik heb geen acteerachtergrond en het spelen van de verdrietige momenten waren wel iets moeilijker maar over het algemeen hoefde ik voor mijn rol geen ingrijpende dingen te doen
7718799 nee ik ben daar nog nooit eerder geweest ik vond het echt leuk daar we hebben van de tien dagen dat we daar in paramaribo waren veel dagen gewerkt ik heb niet echt veel van het binnenland gezien in de stad zijn we wel overal geweest vooral naar alle nachtclubs in de gevangenissen hebben we ook gefilmd dat was heftig maar interessant ik heb daar ook echt lekker gegeten ik houd namelijk van javaans en surinaams eten
7718800 de leukste sc ne was op het moment dat we met bivakmutsen op een overval in een juwelier moesten plegen ik was een van de personen die de glazen vitrines met daarin de juwelen kapot mocht slaan ik kreeg dus gewoon betaald terwijl ik iets kapot maakte
7718801 ik weet niet of ik dit moet zeggen maar we waren op een gegeven moment bij een grasveld met scooters en toen ik was onderuitgegaan omdat het glad was en belande onder die scooter iedereen vond het grappig ik trouwens niet zo
7718802 ik vond het grappig ik was niet echt naar mezelf aan het kijken meer naar de film als geheel ik vond het ook niet raar om te zien nu als ik die sc nes terugzie komen er allemaal herinneringen naar boven
7718803 ja bij heel veel mensen wel voor mij niet echt ik vind vrijheid belangrijker maar om echt vrij te zijn moet je wel financieel onafhankelijk zijn het gaat mij er meer om dat ik plezier heb in de dingen die ik doe en dat ik genoeg te eten heb ik wil wel gewoon op vakantie gaan wanneer ik dat wil dus wat dat betreft is geld wel belangrijk ik zou niet om mij te bewijzen voor een meisje zoals spike wel doet daarom gaan stelen
7718804 het was gezellig op de set sommige kende ik al goed het is een kleine sc ne dus in principe kent iedereen elkaar wel
7718805 ik wil mijn studie media en entertainment in haarlem afmaken onder rookie entertaiment heb ik een mixtape uitgebracht onder hou het straat records daar ben ik mede eigenaar van en dat wil ik in de toekomst gaan uitbreiden ik ben ook nog steeds bezig met schrijven en tracks opnemen mijn inspiratie voor nummers haal ik uit dingen die ik meemaak in het leven ik kan nog echt niet zeggen wanneer mijn album uitkomt het komt wel wanneer het af is ik werk nu veel samen met negativ en we zijn als label ook bezig met broertje een dertienjarige rapper uit amsterdam zuid oost
7718806 kijk ik ben nooit uit op ruzie maar ja als het zo moet lopen dan doe ik het wel ik heb wel waardige tegenstanders nodig om te dissen er zijn genoeg mensen die ik pannenkoeken vind en dat weten ze zelf ook wel daar hoef ik geen diss track voor te maken
7718807 nee hoor ik weet hoe het er aan toe gaat bij interviews er zijn zoveel mensen en vaak ben ik dan als een van de eerste en komt de rest een half uur later aankakken en heb ik de taxi voor niks betaalt nu ben ik gewoon rustig op tijd weggegaan met de trein vanuit almere
7718808 het is een liefdesverhaal dat draait om spike en rosalie daarom heen gebeuren allemaal dingen die in het stadsleven voorkomen zoals verraad en diefstal mijn personage musu zit in het groepje waar spike bij wil horen het is wel een soort verhaal wat nu een beetje speelt dat bolletjesslikken en het hele urban gebeuren ik houd zelf niet zo van het woord urban
7718809 ik doe gewoon nu wat ik altijd al heb gedaan en dat is hiphop maken ik zou mezelf ook niet urban noemen urban is door de media verzonnen om het toegankelijker te maken hiphop is denk ik voor hun iets te straat
7718810 toen ik opgroeide waren er ook al van dat soort mannetjes die meeliepen om erbij te horen en niet echt bezig waren met de toekomst ik ben totaal niet bezig met kettingen en bling shit dus vond ik het wel grappig om een keer zo iemand neer te zetten die erg materialistisch is tijdens de soundtrack kon ik dus ook rappen in de huid van musu ik wil alles dat glimt maar die shit komt niet gratis ik haat het maar je leert er mee leven en ik zie eigenlijk niks anders in mijn hele omgeving ik weet niet beter is dat ik het spelletje maar door speel een product van dezelfde maatschappij die me veroordeelt dat is dus gerapt op de rol die ik speel in de film en dat is weer eens iets anders dan dat normaal doe
7718811 als iemand mij zou vragen voor een film en het idee van de film staat me aan dan zou ik gewoon ja zeggen ik ben aan deze rol gekomen toen mijn management mij vertelde dat er voor een film dansers rappers en acteurs werden gezocht en ik dacht waarom niet het idee dat ik een deel uit zou maken van de eerste nederlandse muzikale urbanfilm stond me wel aan er zijn wel veel sc nes van mij en kimo uitgeknipt ik vond het maken van de film een leuke ervaring en zo kan je er weer over meepraten het opnemen van een film betekent wel veel wachten met muziek is dat anders dat is vooral het vele opnieuw doen omdat je dan niet tevreden bent
7718812 ik vond iedereen over het algemeen heel goed ik denk dat sommige mensen misschien zelfs verder moeten gaan met film in plaats van met rap zoals de sc ne met de ruzie tussen sophie en negativ vond ik erg geloofwaardig en sterk ik hoefde niet zon emotionele rol te spelen wat ik opzich wel jammer vond want ik had meer kunnen laten zien wat ik moest doen was vrij neutraal het lijkt mij wel een uitdaging om een rol te spelen waarbij ik meer moet acteren zeg maar dat ik de verliefdheid zou moeten spelen of dat je als heteroman een homo moet neerzetten als je dat goed doet dan ben je gewoon echt een goede acteur lijkt mij wel stoer om te doen
7718813 bij deze film is het zo dat er eigenlijk allemaal mensen met geen acteerervaring een film op nemen dat is opzich al een uitdaging voor de mensen die er veel geld in steken voor iedereen is het daardoor leuk geweest om wat ervaring op te doen en te kijken of het wat voor je was
7718814 die van probz het personage jimmy zijn rol vind ik de coolste hij is die agressieve gekke gast hij durft alles hij is niet echt aanwezig maar toch weer wel
7718815 het leukste ik weet niet of ik dat moet vertellen want straks krijg ik nog een factuur achteraf maar dat was tijdens een sc ne die er ook is uitgeknipt we reden met scooters en kwamen dan negativ tegen bij een grasveldje die lag te chillen met sophie op die dag was er ook weleens tijd tussendoor dat we even niet hoefde te filmen dan pakte ik zon scooter en reed ik een stukje door de bijlmer ik ben nooit echt een scootermannetje geweest en ben toen flink op mijn bek gegaan gelukkig had niemand dat gezien
7718816 ja zeker eind januari ga ik een videoclip schieten van mijn album rayacties vechten op het schoolplein heb ik in een nieuw jasje gestoken er werkt nu een jazzmuzikant aan mee chris hinze hij is een zestiger dus wel een veteraan in het vak hij heeft extra fluit gespeeld in het nummer nadat hij mijn album had beluisterd heeft hij mij benaderd hij vond het interessant wilde iets met rap doen en vroeg of ik het leuk vond om met hem mee te gaan met zijn theatertour in april wat grappig is is dat ik vroeger van zijn platen samples heb gebruikt om beats mee te maken en nu sta ik straks met hem in het theater ik heb er zeker zin in ik heb al wat nummers klaar maar moet nog zeker drie nummers maken verder ben ik hard bezig aan mijn derde album die neem ik thuis op sinds 2003 heb ik een studio thuis deze verhuur ik als ik hem niet gebruik tegen een laag tarief zo heb ik laatst nog een track opgenomen met dex klonk goed kan wel een hitje worden mijn album drop ik denk ik net na de zomer ik heb nu negen nummers af en ik vind dat er ongeveer veertien nummers op moeten staan de naam wordt denk ik iets van raycansitrant of rayvolutionair het kan nog alle kanten op
7718817 in de praktijk is het nog ingewikkelder er zit een groot verschil tussen film en realiteit als je de film realistischer zou maken moet je ook bepaalde details erin stoppen zoals bijvoorbeeld in de sc ne dat een jongen loopt te schuimbekken van de opengeknapte coca nebolletjes in zijn buik in echt zouden zij zijn buik opensnijden om de drugs eruit te halen er zit in dit verhaal weinig disney misschien wel op de momenten dat er gezongen wordt dat is die disney draai zoals de jongen die voor de auto staat of bij het nummer de bolletjes blues met mark dakriet dat wordt wel wat sfeervoller gepresenteerd en heeft dat magische
7718818 wat me het meest is bijgebleven is de battle op het pleintje dat de jongens tegen de meiden lopen te rappen het was een hele mooi dag met een gezellig sfeertje we hadden heel veel plezier om dat te doen
7718819 wat ik erg leuk vond om te doen was toen ik in het huis van mijn personage delano dus mijn soldiers moest oppeppen omdat zij een overal gingen plegen bij de juwelier wat nou het grappige was is dat we bijna geen tekst kregen we moesten bijna alle sc nes improviseren voor sommige mensen was dat wat moeilijker dan voor de anderen maar het leuke was dat je in staat was om alles in je eigen taal te zeggen
7718820 ik denk dat delano onderdeel is van mij delano is soms wat overdreven maar bij bepaalde punten van hem komt het erg overeen met mijn persoon daarom kon ik het ook zo gemakkelijk spelen
7718821 ik ben uitgenodigd voor een gesprek ik denk aan de hand van mijn reputatie maar ik was niet op komen dagen de tweede keer ook niet het acteren leek me niks ik ben toch een rapper maar probz jimmy in de film zei tegen mij dat ik echt moest gaan omdat het personage echt bij me paste dus de derde keer ben ik wel gekomen en moest ik een paar stukjes spelen ik kreeg zowat een staande ovatie dus blijkbaar kan ik toch wel acteren ik belde meteen mijn moeder op om te vertellen dat ik een rol had in een film en ze zei dat ik mijn hele leven al acteerde met al die mensen om me heen
7718822 er was een ontspannen sfeer het was erg gezellig alleen de productiegroep en cameramannen waren wat minder ontspannen en daar klikte het wat minder goed mee
7718823 nee nooit ik zou nooit iets stelen voor een vrouw alleen voor mijzelf mijn zoontje of mijn moeder om te eten ik zou mezelf zo naar beneden halen als ik dat wel zou doen
7718824 nee ik ben wel gevraagd en heb tekst aangeleverd maar naar hun mening was te grof ik zat in mijn personage van delano en hij is best grof uiteindelijk hebben ze dus achter mijn rug om besloten dat ik niet mee kon doen aan de track ik hoorde het van een jongen die in de studio was en het had opgevangen ik had liever gewild dat zij dat meteen aan mij hadden verteld

7718826 the 80 plus certification requires the tuniq potency to run at greater than or equal to 80 efficiency at 20 50 and 100 of rated power output while the specification has been met at 20 and 50 the power supply failed to hit the 80 mark at 100 load for both 110vac and 240vac input the power supply did however meet the atx12v minimum required efficiency and i have therefore given the power supply an overall pass in this section
7718827 ik heb opgetreden voor de nederlandse gemeenschap daar in peking deze mensen studeren daar en werken bij de nederlandse ambassade ik ben daar een week geweest en hoefde n keertje op te treden dus de rest van de week kon ik peking ontdekken en twee weken geleden ben ik naar cura ao geweest maar dat was anders dan in china mensen kochten daar gewoon een kaartje want er wonen een paar duizend nederlanders daar en dan sta je op het strand onder een palmboom op te treden geweldige ervaring na mijn stuk was een pauze en kwam de show van jules deelder achteraf was het misschien niet zon goede combinatie geweest omdat onze shows totaal niet op elkaar lijken ik deed echt een cabaretvoorstelling terwijl hij meer gedichten voorlas en plaatjes draaide
7718828 soms is het publiek sneller geshockeerd terwijl het natuurlijk fantasie is
7718829 niet echt maar aan sommige reacties merk ik her wel
7718830 de naam is eigenlijk eerst gekomen ik vond het mooi staan qua letters met de pootjes van de h omhoog en die van de p naar beneden maar het is ook heel erg een thema in mijn leven ik ben altijd die jongen die gewoon aardig gevonden wil worden maar ondertussen heb ik een scherp randje die niet iedereen ziet het wolf effect dus
7718831 ik beatbox al vanaf mijn dertiende jaar ik ben ooit begonnen met hiphop muziek maken en later kwamen de grappen erbij met run dmc in 1988 is het eigenlijk helemaal begonnen ik was helemaal in too hiphop ik ga nog steeds wel naar battles en feesten maar mijn muzieksmaak is wel wat breder geworden ik luister nu net zo goed naar coldplay en ik vind op dit moment dat nummer van james blunt youre beautiful erg goed maar de zwarte muziek blijft toch mijn ding beetje jazz enzo
7718832 over het algemeen wel maar ik vertel niet letterlijk wat er gebeurd is natuurlijk als ik het vertel zoals het echt is gegaan is het niet leuk ik overdrijf het altijd wel een beetje de mensen in mijn omgeving herkennen dat soms wel zoals in mijn eerste programma extreem had ik het over een baco lul ik vond dat zo irritant altijd dat we met zn zessen een pot hadden gemaakt iedereen besteld bier en hij een bacardi cola dus de hele pot leeg en die jongen wist ook wel dat hij het was hij kon er wel om lachen hoor
7718833 ja geweldig ik heb de havo gedaan op het montessori lyceum in de pijp in amsterdam een beetje een kakschool maar er hing echt een open sfeer en je kon alles doen wat je wilde mijn ouders wilden mij eigenlijk eerst van die school af halen maar dat is het ergste wat ze konden doen ik moest en zou op die school blijven na de havo heb ik nog even vwo gedaan maar niet afgemaakt ik heb toen hbo personeel en arbeid gestudeerd en dat afgemaakt mijn ouders vonden de kunstacademie meer wat voor mij maar ik wou niet eindigen als een werkloze artiest ik heb verder niks met mijn studie gedaan omdat ik toen ik net afgestudeerd was de comedyprijs won in amsterdam het eerste jaar had ik nul geld terwijl mijn vrienden met autos aankwamen ik zat daar op mijn studentenkamertje maar dat is allemaal gelukkig goed gekomen
7718834 hans teeuwen kan beschouwd worden als de pionier van de jongere cabaret generatie
7718835 hans teeuwen kan beschouwd worden als de pionier van de jongere cabaret generatie en ik denk ook dat hij wel weer terug komt
7718836 whats happening is that the price of the metal at retail has little to do with the exchange prices of silver because the physical is such a small part of the market in other words the physical price is being swamped by the financial price sure you can see shortages of physical but thats such a tiny piece of the leverage game that its almost insignificant
7718837 given recent market movement moodys believes these firms currently have limited access to common and preferred equity capital at economically attractive terms
7718838 the institutions are too big to fail and the government needs them operating
7718839 its the only part of the mortgage market thats even remotely working right now
7718840 at the end of the day probably the u s governments going to come in
7718841 i wouldnt want to be a preferred share owner or a common stock owner but if you own the debt or the mbs youre going to be okay
7718842 wij zijn met left nu bijna 3 jaar bij elkaar maar we kennen elkaar al zon 6 jaar en hebben ook al samen meerdere cover bandjes gehad we hebben elkaar leren kennen bij jongerencentrum odeon in veldhoven vlakbij eindhoven waar we in een popworkshop bij elkaar gezet werden al vrij snel merkten we dat het goed klikte tussen ons drie n en sindsdien zijn we altijd samen muziek blijven maken
7718843 altijd voor je droom gaan je niet teveel aantrekken van anderen maar je eigen gevoel volgen niet voor de meest veilige weg kiezen maar voor de leukste en spannendste weg leven van dag tot dag en uit elke dag proberen iets moois te halen
7718844 alle nummers hebben qua tekst in ieder geval een autobiografische oorsprong ik zou me dat ook niet anders voor kunnen stellen mijn teksten gaan vaak over mijn angsten en wensen en vrij zware themas zoals liefde leven en dood wat ik zing is altijd cht gemeend en recht uit het hart niet dat ik altijd een neerslachtige stille jongen ben hoor juist niet door te zingen over mijn angsten en verdriet geef ik ze een plek in de liedjes ze zitten dan minder in mijn hoofd
7718845 ja left heeft alleen engelstalige nummers als je erover nadenkt is het misschien raar om niet in de taal te zingen die je het meest machtig bent toen ik voor de eerste keer een gitaar in mijn handen kreeg pakte ik die meteen links vast op dezelfde manier waren de eerste woorden die ik zong bij een eigen liedje ook in het engels ik denk ook omdat het engels vooral als je wat jonger bent al snel cool klinkt als je als 12 jarig jochie drie akkoorden kunt spelen en een simpele engels klinkende tekst eroverheen kunt zingen voel je je al snel een echte rockster sindsdien praat ik in het nederlands en zing ik in het engels
7718846 we spelen op dit moment zon 40 keer per jaar maar we hopen dit volgend jaar te verdubbelen we hebben helaas nog nooit in het buitenland opgetreden ook dat is iets waar we zeker komend jaar aan willen gaan werken left is bij uitstek een live band en we willen ons dan ook vooral bewijzen in het live circuit
7718847 wij zijn niet echt op de hoogte van wat nu populair is in de top 40 of zo in de cd speler van de bandauto zit op dit moment het laatste album van jw roy een brabantse singer songwriter met een prachtig doorleefde bluesstem maar dat kan volgende week weer iets totaal anders zijn
7718848 wij luisteren zelf naar ontzettend veel soorten muziek vaak niet eens naar rock dat kan bij ons verschillen van jeff buckley tot miles davis en van spinvis tot the misfits er is niet zozeer een genre of soort muziek dat interessant is op zich of het nu pop jazz blues rock of hiphop is het gaat om het gevoel als muziek cht is en je voelt de emotie doordat het je raakt van binnen dan maakt het niet uit in wat voor stijl of genre de muziek gemaakt wordt
7718849 tja als je de die stemming op de site van de grote prijs mag geloven maken we inderdaad een hele goede kans maar het heeft niet veel zin om daar verder over te speculeren we gaan ons uiterste best doen om er voor onszelf en voor het publiek een geweldige show van te maken op 22 december in de paradiso het zou natuurlijk wel een grote eer zijn om de publieksprijs in ontvangst te mogen nemen
7718850 drie totaal verschillende bands met ieder hun eigen krachten en kwaliteiten de bands zijn totaal niet met elkaar te vergelijken dat lijkt me erg lastig voor de jury maar het zijn alledrie verdiende finalisten die het ons stuk voor stuk erg moeilijk kunnen maken in de finale we zien de finale daarom ook niet meer als wedstrijd maar als prijs een optreden voor honderden mensen in de mooiste rocktempel van ons land is voor ons op zich al een droom die uitkomt laten we ons liever daarop concentreren dan op de concurrentie en de jury
7718851 waarschijnlijk gaan we dezelfde nummers spelen als in de halve finale misschien in een andere volgorde we hebben toen geen enkel punt van kritiek gekregen van de jury dus we zouden wel stom zijn om een compleet andere set te spelen wel gaan we natuurlijk zorgen dat we blijven verrassen
7718852 natuurlijk lekker feesten we komen met een groep van 120 man vanuit eindhoven naar de paradiso die avond als we winnen gaat het dak er cht af maar na de kater van de volgende dag zullen we toch bij elkaar komen om eens serieus te bespreken wat de plannen worden voor de toekomst
7718853 nou plannen is een groot woord maar het is voor ons een grote wens om in 2006 een full length album op te nemen in een goede studio met een goede producer hiervoor is veel geld nodig dus daar zou een groot deel van het bedrag aan op kunnen gaan ook moeten we cht een bandbus hebben nu gaan we steeds met twee autos naar onze optredens en dat is ongezellig en ook nog duur qua benzine dus hopelijk in 2006 een nieuw album een bandbus en dan ontzettend veel spelen door het hele land
7718854 ik ben een jongen die keihard aan het knokken is met mijn producer mr fonc om onze muziek ten gehore te brengen
7718855 tell me to stop is gebaseerd op eigen ervaringen mijn ex relatie is helaas stuk gelopen op dagelijkse problemen daar gaat het liedje over
7718856 mijn producer mr fonc ken ik al vanuit mijn jeugd wij gingen vaak skaten met een hele groep in amersfoort mijn back up vocal p nuts heb ik leren kennen in het uitgaansleven hij begon met beatboxen en dan maakte ik er een mooie flow overheen
7718857 ik ben nu druk bezig met mijn debuutalbum dat gepland staat om begin februari 2006 uit te komen het wordt een album met nummers waarvan veel gebruik is gemaakt van live instrumenten ook ben ik druk met het opnemen van mijn tweede single met bijbehorende clip the fur de band die op dat nummer te horen is bestaat uit een drummer gitarist bassist toetsenist en mijn back up zanger p nuts ik ben nu eigenlijk fulltime bezig met mijn muziek en daarnaast mc ik nog steeds af en toe
7718858 rowena heb ik wel eens gezien in de lexion in amsterdam toen temtation island op de televisie kwam heb ik haar een keer aangesproken met de vraag of ze wou figureren in mijn clip na het lezen van het script was ze zo enthousiast dat ze de hoofdrol wou en aangezien ze nu een beetje een bekend gezicht heeft had ik daar geen problemen mee
7718859 het hangt er vanaf ik vind het leuk als iemand met een leuke uitstraling op mij afstapt ik word daar echter wel verlegen van dus stap ik liever zelf op iemand af als ik zelfverzekerd ben
7718860 het liefst met the neptunes en als zij nog leefden had ik willen samenwerken met marvin gaye of curtis mayfield mijn favoriete album is die van lauren hill the miseducation of lauren hill
7718861 ik heb nu nog geen plannen nee natuurlijk droom ik er wel over wie niet maar ik wil eerst nederland veroveren mijn teksten zijn lekker luchtig en gaan over dagelijkse gebeurtenissen daardoor kunnen mensen zich gemakkelijk identificeren met mijn songs doordat ik engelstalig rap is de drempel minder hoog om naar het buitenland te gaan
7718862 in 2002 stond ik tijdens de ffwd heineken danceparade in rotterdam op de erotica car van studio 27 te mcen dat was zo cool dat vergeet ik nooit meer ik wil het liefst een keer naar de miami spring break in de verenigde staten dan is het in miami n groot feest tijdens de lente
7718863 heel erg ijdel ik kan niet langs een spiegel of een raam lopen zonder een blik erin te werpen ik eet ook zo min mogelijk vet ook al ben ik dol op roti zodat ik geen pukkels krijg ik sport vier keer per week in de sportschool en daarnaast skate surf wakeboard en dans ik veel ook ben ik met mode bezig ik zie mijzelf eerder als een trendzetter dan een trendvolger
7718864 ik heb drie tattoos op mijn beide schouders en op mijn buik op mijn buik staat mijn eerste tattoo een zwarte panter deze verwijst naar mijn donkere roots mijn tweede is een maori tattoo op mijn linkerschouder hij is gezet door een echte maori uit nieuw zeeland en weergeeft mijn levensweg de derde superfly op mijn rechterschouder verwijst naar een nummer van curtis mayfield dat nummer gaat erover dat je moet doen wat je zelf wilt onzekerheid is een last dat remt je alleen maar af
7718865 je moet er vooral voor gaan neem je muziek op en laat het aan iedereen in je omgeving horen als zij het goed vinden probeer je een studio te vinden en als zij het slecht vinden en het is je ambitie om door te gaan probeer dan beter te worden de aanhouder wint
7718866 i still care is echt een gevoelig liedje kwa tekst
7718867 zenuwachtig is niet het juiste woord maar er staat wel wat druk op de ketel het vervelende met dit soort dingen is dat de show voorbereiden maar een klein deel is van het geheel je bent bezig met de spullen die je nodig hebt het vervoer de tijden de kaarten die je met korting aan je 75 beste vrienden kunt verkopen en meer van dat soort dingen je set voorbereiden is het leukste maar kost maar weinig tijd in vergelijking tot de heisa er omheen
7718868 ik kan me voorstellen dat de luisteraar denkt waar maakt hij zich druk over
7718869 in principe wel ik schrijf niet altijd over mijn leven maar als ik dat wel doe gaat het wel echt over mij en de dingen die ik heb meegemaakt ik probeer altijd te relativeren en me te verplaatsen in de luisteraar als ik ga zeuren over kleinigheidjes kan ik me voorstellen dat de luisteraar denkt waar maakt hij zich druk over dat probeer ik te voorkomen of juist als onderwerp te gebruiken voor een tekst
7718870 voornamelijk hiphop sommige popmuziek is wel geinig zo luister ik best graag naar blof of herman van veen het hangt helemaal af van mijn stemming naast hiphop luister ik het liefst naar simpele lichtverteerbare muziek ik heb het gevoel dat ik soms te veel nadenk en lichte muziek kan soms helpen om je verstand even op nul te zetten wat weer kan leiden tot inspiratie net als het kijken naar een simpele lachfilm bijvoorbeeld
7718871 ik schat mijn kansen goed in dit omdat ik uitga van mijn eigen kracht je moet niet vergeten dat er een driekoppige jury is voor de grote prijs zij moeten overtuigd worden je kunt het publiek helemaal gek rocken maar je kunt ook een heel slechte microfooncontrole hebben en daar let de jury op het hangt van zoveel variabelen af of je die prijs wint ik weet waar ik toe in staat ben en dat geeft me zelfvertrouwen mijn doel is dan ook vooral om optimaal te presteren vanaf daar is het aan de jury in het verleden hebben er veel grote namen zoals lange frans en baas b spacekees amp terilekst opgezwolle pete philly en ali b meegedaan met de grote prijs maar die hebben maar zelden gewonnen het kan raar lopen
7718872 mijn doel is dan ook vooral om optimaal te presteren vanaf daar is het aan de jury
7718873 ik ben er heel trots op om in de finale te staan dankzij de line up ik respecteer iedereen die muziek maakt op juist dit level de mensen in deze finale hebben alleen naam omdat ze hard werken niet omdat er veel geld in ze is gepompt of omdat ze grote hits hebben gescoord daar moet je wel respect voor hebben muzikaal gezien ligt mod me het meest de beats voel ik heel erg en manier van rocken ook jawat is inmiddels een zwaargewicht in de nederlandstalige sc ne en maakt nu deel uit van misschien wel de meest succesvolle nederlandse hiphop tour ooit buitenwesten hij kan een publiek gek maken kortom een mooie uitdaging voor kleine jiggy
7718874 je moet de huid immers niet verkopen voor de beer geschoten is
7718875 tja heel erg lam worden he het weekend is het kerst dus gezellig met mijn familie en vrienden zijn dat is het belangrijkste in de wereld voor mij ik probeer niet te veel na te denken over wat ik ga doen mocht ik winnen je moet de huid immers niet verkopen voor de beer geschoten is
7718876 ja dat wel enigszins maar daar moet je me later nog maar eens naar vragen
7718877 ik verwacht mijn album wel rond de zomer van 2006 te droppen tegen die tijd is mijn eerste single met bijbehorende videoclip wel verschenen tegen mensen die eventueel iets van mij verwachten wil ik zeggen dat ik hetzelfde doe de reden dat dingen soms langer duren dan je zou willen is omdat ik niemand wil teleurstellen en dan in eerste plaats mezelf niet ik weet dat ik in staat ben tot het maken van heel goede muziek maar tussen kunnen en doen zit een gapend gat dat je alleen kunt vullen met geduld en toewijding dat vraag ik dus ook van mijn supporters
7718878 ik had veel mensen verwacht maar niet zoveel we hadden het een beetje onderschat de deur moest al om 1 00 uur dicht en de mensen die op de gastenlijst stonden konden niet meer naar binnen er stonden gewoon vips anderhalf uur voor de deur en zijn uiteindelijk niet naar binnen gekomen en ik had nog gezegd dat ze maar beter vroeg konden komen er hadden ook nog wel meer dingen beter gekund maar al met al iedereen die binnen was waren echt lyrisch het was een lekker chaotisch avondje precies zoals we het bedoeld hadden
7718879 omdat mijn smaak heel breed is ik wilde gewoon een cd maken die ik zelf zou kopen op cd 1 staan de betere tracks die ik zelf zou draaien in een club en op cd 2 staan tracks waar ik zelf naar zou luisteren gewoon goede muziek er staat bijvoorbeeld n nummer op waarvan ik al heel lang wou dat als ik een cd zou maken dat hij er op moest komen te staan dat is het nummer bomb the bass ft justin warfield bug powder dust dat is een nummer uit een sc ne uit de film blade en toen ik dat hoorde was ik helemaal blown away met pijn en moeite heb ik dat ding in amerika kunnen clearen cd 2 zou eigenlijk de soundtrack zijn van de film die ik binnen nu en tien jaar zou maken
7718880 ik zat met een aantal muzikanten van tjeerd oosterhuis do alain clark tot di rect van het publishing bureau talpa music voor een week in een huis ik heb mijn mobiele studio meegenomen en ben s nachts gaan werken aan een track toen heb ik de volgende ochtend the beatkidz uitgenodigd en die hadden zoiets van hey dit is goede shit en zij zijn daarop wat gaan schrijven en hebben ze daar het stuk ingerapt vervolgens heb ik bas en spike van di rect uitgenodigd en hun gitaarstuk erin verwerkt toen is de groffe opzet van de single tot stand gekomen gisteren is bekend geworden dat mijn clip gedraaid wordt op de high rotation lijst dus komt hij fucking vaak op tmf en mtv
7718881 de eerste keer sprong ik naast de matten die op de weg lagen en ik had geen beschermende kleding aan of zoiets dus kwam keihard op de straat terecht
7718882 nou ja een combinatie van beiden eigenlijk ik heb best wel vaak opgetreden in japan en dan pik je nog wel wat op het japans praten was een idee van de regisseur en mij om dat te doen het hele idee van de clip hebben we samen bedacht
7718883 tien jaar geleden moest ik een naam bedenken en de mensen die muziek maakten met behulp van computers werden devil worshippers genoemd computermuziek werd demonische muziek genoemd ook ik maak gebruik van een computer diablo betekent letterlijk duivel en diablo klonk gewoon lekker
7718884 ik rij in een bmw het liefst zou ik een oude amerikaan rijden maar dan sta ik straks met mijn auto elke keer langs de weg en het is niks voor in nederland met al die drempels
7718885 ja eigenlijk in twee opzichten het eerste opzicht is dat moby ooit is begonnen met een heel andere muziekstijl dan waar hij nu in is belandt en ten tweede heeft hij zijn naam nooit veranderd en dat geldt beide ook voor mij toen ik vijftien was zat ik meer in de hardcore sc ne dat was toen hot en dat zou ik nu bijvoorbeeld nooit meer draaien langzaamaan is mijn muziek gegroeid naar de stijl die ik wilde
7718886 omdat ze mijn muziek daar beter begrepen het begon allemaal in engeland ik had daar een plaat gemaakt die was echt een club bom en deze werd opgepikt door bbc 1 op een gegeven moment wilde iedereen hem en stond hij op vele cds en ben ik daar veel gaan draaien het is voor mij daar helemaal los gegaan dat waren goede tijden en ik stapte meteen hoog in dit wou ik natuurlijk ook wel in nederland engeland was toen de trendsetter van de dancesc ne de rest van de wereld volgde wat er in engeland gebeurd en ben ik terecht gekomen in isra l amerika japan brazili en australi op een gegeven vroegen mensen zich af wie ik was en werd geboekt voor dancevalley
7718887 het lijkt me wel cult om een keer uit te komen met een ballad
7718888 ik wilde eerst een fatsoenlijk album maken ten tweede een goed mixalbum leveren en een mooie clip maken waar ik zelf goed naar voren kwam dat heb ik nu gedaan ik heb net mijn hele website vernieuwd eind december wil ik een nieuwe clip opnemen die in januari uit moet komen ik heb nog geen flauw idee welke dat gaat worden ik twijfel nog tussen een hiphop track een electro plaat of een ballad het lijkt me wel cult om een keer uit te komen met een ballad een rock ballad ook een dvd met allemaal interessante content komt er nog aan verder ben ik al een tijdje met allemaal randzaken bezig zoals in kleine oplages shirtjes en petjes met daarop logos of een zelfbedachte tekst zoiets als respect doesnt pay the bills of what doesnt kill you makes you stronger ik wil ook nog veel gaan doen op het gebied van film volgend jaar ga ik weer heel veel doen met dance4life dat is een belangrijk goed doel voor mij dus daar ga ik groots aan deelnemen
7718889 het is moeilijk voor serieuze muzikanten om een hoge chartpositie te krijgen als je het tegen bullshit moet opnemen
7718890 het is voor mij onmogelijk om aan te geven wat ik echt het beste nummer vind maar qua groep staat the prodigy bij mij hoog in het vaandel net als rage against the machine zij maken gewoon goede nummers die de tijd doorstaan een favoriete van mij op dit moment is golddigger van kanye west en jamie foxx een simpele plaat maar wel heel doeltreffend ik heb een hekel aan copycats die doen alsof zij het nummer gemaakt hebben terwijl deze in feite door iemand anders is gemaakt of parodie n zoals waarismebird op watskeburt ik bedoel wie koopt die dingen en ik heb een bloedhekel aan al die ringtone bullshit het is moeilijk voor serieuze muzikanten om een hoge chartpositie te krijgen als je het tegen bullshit moet opnemen er is nog zoveel niet ontdekt talent in nederland en dan gaan ze een kans geven aan mensen zoals in de nix factor
7718891 de millenium dome in londen was wel aardig het is het enige object dat te zien is vanuit de ruimte naast de chinese muur het is een slag groter dan sensation 50 000 mensen in n zaal er stond een reuzenrad binnen en die leek zelfs klein en in japan heb ik een keer gedraaid in een flatgebouw op de elfde verdieping dat is een legendarische club die heet the liquid room de vloer bewoog en ik heb echt twee uur lang kippenvel gehad
7718892 ik neem namelijk altijd een grote fles spa blauw mee als ik ga draaien zie het echt als topsport
7718893 voordat ik ga draaien ga ik eerst even naar het toilet ik neem namelijk altijd een grote fles spa blauw mee als ik ga draaien zie het echt als topsport er moet ook niemand wat aan me vragen als ik bezig ben het voelt net of ik aan het hardlopen ben als iemand tegen me praat raak ik uit mijn trance wat ik doe is dat als er een bepaalde hit is die vaak gedraaid wordt of die avond al een paar keer voorbij is gekomen dan maak ik een mix ervan zodat ie niet gaat vervelen dat is van mij dan iets extras dat andere djs niet hebben na een optreden ga ik meestal meteen naar huis of het moet echt heel leuk zijn of er draait een collega die ik wil horen ik kom ook een paar minuten van te voren binnen ik ben niet echt een feestbeest ik weet ook niet wat ik zou moeten doen op zon feest ik ga dan liever naar een concert
7718894 ik vond het een beetje vreemd ik ben geen fotomodel maar je raakt na een tijdje wel gewend aan het poseren ik had echt helemaal niks aan en er stonden daar iets van zes mensen om me heen en er is dan een team dat ervoor zorgt dat je er op je best uitziet voor de camera ik schaam me niet dus had zo iets van kom maar op ik vond het ook wel rock amp roll om te doen ik zat eerst te twijfelen maar ik dacht nu kan het nog ben nu nog een beetje in vorm en het heeft niks met die kabouter award te maken ze wisten het daar niet eens
7718895 nee ik zou niet de nummer n dj willen zijn dat is niet mijn doel ik zou liever een grammy willen winnen ik voel me ook meer muzikant dan dj draaien doe ik nu gewoon omdat ik het leuk vindt en daar de kans voor krijg er is blijkbaar plek in de markt voor mij ik zie djen gewoon zo ik hoef niet meer uit te gaan ik kom ergens binnen en krijg de beste plek in die club krijg gratis drinken smak geld mee en luister de hele avond naar de muziek die ik vet vindt wat wil je nog meer
7718896 ik zou echt heel graag een film willen maken het liefst een dramatische film die nog twee dagen na het zien ervan in je hoofd blijft rondspoken ik zou dan willen regisseren en de muziek willen maken
7718897 het ouderschap is het meest respectvolle beroep waar de ouder eigenlijk geen respect voor krijgt
7718898 ik heb eigenlijk twee helden mijn ouders het is zon opoffering elke dag om je kinderen op te voeden op dit moment denk ik nog niet aan kids het ouderschap is het meest respectvolle beroep waar de ouder eigenlijk geen respect voor krijgt
7718899 maak vooral je eigen muziek dat is heel belangrijk je moet je eigen identiteit aannemen en je leert er gewoon het meest van het is erg moeilijk om door te breken als dj er zijn zoveel goede djs over de hele wereld contacten leggen en netwerken is ook belangrijk
7718900 ik heb echt een verzameldrang naast alles van transformers koop ik ook zowat elk nederlandse rapalbum
7718901 ik heb de havo afgemaakt op van maerlant in eindhoven ik ben daar eigenlijk begonnen met rappen ik woonde toen in een dorp vlakbij eindhoven en daar hebben ze zon andere mentaliteit dan in gouda waar ik tot mijn 14e heb gewoond het leek wel of ze alles drie keer langzamer deden ik isoleerde mijzelf en begon raps te schrijven de kids vonden dat daar wel cool en zo begon mijn sociale leven weer maar daar was het te klein voor me dus ben verhuisd en woon nu in amersfoort en dat bevalt me prima
7718902 nee niet allemaal ik haal echt overal inspiratie vandaan ik kan van alles gebruiken in mijn teksten ik heb mazzel met mijn kleurrijke fantasie
7718903 iedereen download muziek de meeste nederlandse artiesten verdienen maar erg weinig aan hun cds ze verdienen meer aan optredens ik heb wel geluk dat ik het album spacekees amp terilekst in eigen beheer heb uitgebracht dus daar verdien ik nog wat aan maar zoals ik al zei iedereen download toch dus ik denk dat ik weinig geld misloop
7718904 ik weet het niet het is een tweestrijd omdat sommige mensen ze al kennen en als ik dan een solo album maak en daar staan die tracks op dan langer dan weet ik niet of zij dat zullen waarderen ik kan zo aan het eind van dit jaar een compleet album droppen als ik al mijn materiaal reorganiseer maar die songs zijn allemaal momentopnames in het verleden ik wil nu liever nieuwe nummers maken
7718905 ik heb het gevoel dat ik een andere kijk op het leven heb dan andere mensen men vindt mij vaak ook asociaal en onvriendelijk er is een algemene etiquette waarop men beoordeeld ik vind echter dat ik juist sociaal en vriendelijk ben ik ben best hard in mijn uitingen en gedachten sterf is een soort intro voor ik wil een meisje het is een frustratie over al die aanstellers
7718906 heel belangrijk het is een gave dat een mens kan relativeren en met elkaar overweg kan gaan je moet trots op jezelf zijn en je kunt best met jezelf spotten ik vind dat de hiphop in nederland niet breed genoeg is rapmuziek kan net zo breed zijn als popmuziek het hoeft niet alleen over bijvoorbeeld liefde te gaan de jeugd van tegenwoordig heeft er naar mijn mening voor gezorgd dat mensen breder naar hiphop kijken het publiek gaat steeds meer accepteren de hiphop in amerika is niet te vergelijken met de nederlandse hiphop rappers hier worden meer gezien als kunstenaars in plaats van artiesten maar ik vind wel dat het de goede kant op gaat ik mag in ieder geval niet klagen
7718907 zsje dat is het antwoord op alles ik gebruik het ook voor van alles het is een krachtterm een response zsje is zeker mijn stopwoord en watskeburt moet er natuurlijk in
7718908 ik ben nu bezig om een album met jiggy dj af te maken wij zijn ook beide bezig met een solo album ik ben een bedrijf gestart ruimte van kees bv en verder wil ik mensen helpen met muziek maken ik wil meewerken aan een grote en kwalitatieve hiphopsc ne wie weet maak ik nog een album met willy wartaal of nog n met terilekst met buitenlandse artiesten werken is geen ambitie maar ik zou het wel willen doen geld verdienen is toch een van mijn grootste prioriteiten ik zou wel met tommy t een scandinavische producer willen samenwerken gewoon voor het geld en de ervaring
7718909 het bevalt echt goed onze samenwerking gaat prima we hebben geen deadlines geen beperkingen geen verplichtingen wij zijn heel verschillend van karakter en dat gaat goed samen als we in een bepaalde bui zijn nemen we de leukste tracks op de track gek doen is een weerspiegeling van hoe ons album kribbuh shit eruit gaat zien
7718910 kees en ik hebben een keer hier voor de grap een radioshow opgezet we hebben wat rappers langs laten komen en exclusieve tracks gedraaid en dat online gezet we waren echt verbaasd dat er zoveel mensen luisterden naar die creatieve bullshit
7718911 jiggy was meer de radiopersoon en ik meer de grappenmaker op een dag belde nps naar jiggy en nodigde hem uit voor een proefaflevering voor lijn 5 en kreeg die baan hij is nu elke dinsdag te horen lange frans en baas b hebben een show elke donderdag van 17 00 tot 19 00 uur
7718912 a year ago there was wide agreement in the us middle class that bush and cheney should be impeached that the police state be rolled back and that the iraq war should be ended as soon as physically possible thanks largely to the advent of the vapid and messianic obama these issues have now been thoroughly deflated biden is himself an incurable warmonger who voted for the iraq war and blathered ceaselessly in favor of bushs aggressive adventure to all who would listen naming biden is a brutal insult to the antiwar majority of the democratic party and obama is obviously hoping that the iraq war issue is dead so nobody will care last year obama promised that he would work against the mentality that produced iraq if anyone incarnates that mentality it is biden
7718913 joseph biden by his own words and actions has been a participant in bringing these united states of america into a one world order and for that he is a traitor
7718914 biden has sponsored more damaging drug war legislation than any democrat in congress
7718915 barack obama that presidential coquette who teased the world by not announcing his running mate for nearly two months finally unveiled his vanilla vice presidential bride thus ultimately opting for a marriage of blandness predictability and conciliation
7718916 more of the same but better than that other guy we swear
7718917 the reason is that we plain ran out of time the android bluetooth api was pretty far along but needs some clean up before we can commit to it for the sdk keep in mind that putting it in the 1 0 sdk would have locked us into that api for years to come
7718918 although we would have loved to ship this service in the end the android team decided to pull the api instead of exposing users to risk and breaking compatibility with a future more secure version of the feature we think its obvious that this kind of functionality would be incredibly useful and would open lots of new doors for developers one of our top priorities after the first devices ship is to develop a device to device and possibly device to server rpc mechanism that is fast reliable and protective of developers and users alike
7718919 pe o desculpas aos torcedores mas n o posso recusar uma oferta como a que fizeram
7718920 dit is voor jou want jij bent god voor mij
7718921 het is geweldig weet je dat gewoon fantastisch dat er zoveel mensen bij elkaar op een plaats zijn ze dragen allemaal dezelfde kleur kleding het maakt iedereen gelijk aan elkaar het decor en geluid zijn ook heel goed
7718922 ja samen met mijn businesspartner lou hebben wij een bedrijf opgestart lofu look at fucking us wij gaan in augustus 2007 een sensation op madison square garden in new york neerzetten het thema is nog niet bekend maar het vindt plaats in een soort arena er komen alleen geen 40 000 maar 20 000 mensen maar het wordt zeker sensationeel de artiesten zijn ook nog niet bekend we willen alleen maar topartiesten dat is zeker bijvoorbeeld tiesto en ferry corsten
7718923 ik denk dat ze het leuk gaan vinden ze zullen eerst geschokt zijn want het is anders dan de rest van de acts op de avond het wordt een soort versmelting van metal hiphop en hardcore techno in amerika heb ik al vaker rock en hardcore met elkaar gemixt en daar wordt het erg positief ontvangen door het publiek metal en hardcore zitten eigenlijk dicht tegen elkaar aan beiden harde muziek met dezelfde soort intensiteit we doen trouwens alles live zelfs de elektronische beats zijn live we staan in totaal met acht personen op het speciaal geplaatste tweede podium
7718924 ik ben een grote fan van beide groepen mijn manager heeft in een tijdschrift gelezen dat de dj van slipknot starcream mij verschillende keren noemde in een artikel ik heb contact met hem gezocht via het management en het bleek dat hij mij al een hele tijd in de gaten hield qua muziek en ik dacht echt wauw want ik was al tijden een grote slipknot fan ik wilde graag met hem samenwerken en op zo een soortgelijke manier is het ook met biohazard gegaan
7718925 het was eigenlijk een idee van rob en mij samen wij zijn al erg lang bevriend met elkaar ik denk dat het publiek het heftig gaat vinden de energie van metal en hardcore is gewoon het zelfde de muziek heeft dezelfde beatsnelheid daarom past het goed bij elkaar ik wil elk jaar met iets verrassends komen de kracht van sensation is om iets nieuws met iets vertrouwds te combineren elk jaar moet anders zijn want anders komt het publiek niet meer en zon act is nog niet geweest in nederland ook wilde ik wat meer brede maar wel harde muziekstijlen tijdens sensation black dit jaar
7718926 ik denk dat het komt omdat mensen een beetje angstig zijn ze weten niet wat ze te wachten staat ze denken dat het te hard is maar dat valt best mee we willen het publiek nu ook steeds meer kennis laten maken met het concept door middel van beelden en geluid op onze internetsites we hebben nu 18 cameras in het stadion hangen deze gaan het feest registeren en binnen drie weken moet de dvd in de winkels liggen
7718927 ja dat klopt sensation white was in belgi ook meteen uitverkocht en wij denken nu aan een black editie in belgi we zijn twee weken geleden ook in gesprek geweest met frankrijk en hebben interesse in itali in duitsland waren vorig jaar 12 000 kaarten verkocht en dit jaar zitten we aan de 17 000 daar zie je al een stijging de eerste keer in een land is het allermoeilijkst daar kennen de mensen het concept nog niet dat zullen we ook straks krijgen in amerika maar ook dan willen we proberen de mensen via beelden kennis te laten maken met de productie zodat er meer enthousiasme komt
7718928 de energie van metal en hardcore is gewoon het zelfde
7718929 elk jaar moet anders zijn want anders komt het publiek niet meer
7718930 ik vind het leuk dat jongeren al lerend actief deel uit kunnen maken van de maatschappij en dat mensen ook echt naar hun luisteren het is erg belangrijk hoe jong je ook bent dat je de idee n die je hebt uitdrukking kunt geven op een positieve manier
7718931 dat vind ik een heel interessant onderwerp voor veertienjarige jongetjes dat ze dat durven en zo bespreekbaar maken onder hun leeftijdsgenootjes juich ik alleen maar toe
7718932 het gebouw is prachtig en er zijn goede begeleiders waarvan je echt ziet dat ze dit werk met passie doen de jongeren zijn ook erg leuk en lief zoals ik het nu zie dan had ik hier vroeger ook wel aan mee willen doen je hebt vaak een clich beeld van een buurthuis ik denk dan aan hangen poolen en tafelvoetbal en hier heerst echt zon gezellige huiskamersfeer en het wordt erg professioneel gedaan ik heb nu ook echt zin om die camera van de kids te pakken en zelf aan de slag te gaan haha
7718933 ik vind het toch wel heel fijn om een papiertje te hebben ik had het wel erg naar mijn zin die twee jaar bij mtv juist omdat ik niet alleen maar presenteerde ik bedacht de onderwerpen regisseerde deed camerawerk en het monteren elke dag van was ik van a tot z bezig met het mtv news ik heb geprobeerd om mijn studie te combineren met mijn werk maar dat lukte gewoon niet
7718934 75 percent of the world is covered by water the other 25 percent is covered by zont
7718935 ja ik had wel meerdere dingen die leuk vond dat was het probleem met mij ik vond alles leuk ik heb altijd veel getekend veel geschreven veel gedanst maar zingen was wel altijd mijn prioriteit ik ben gelijk na mijn middelbare school per ongeluk het wereldje ingerold door zinloos met lange frans en baas b
7718936 de optredens en deelnemers waren superleuk het was alleen jammer dat er op een gegeven moment gezeik kwam tussen de organisatie en een andere deelnemer jawat ik was nummer vijf en er waren vier finalisten dus ik viel er net buiten maar omdat jawat er werd uitgetrapt deed ik mee in de finale maar uiteindelijk kwam jawat toch weer terug in en dan maakt iedereen er meteen weer zo een oorlog van ninthe versus jawat terwijl wij verder gewoon hartstikke cool met elkaar zijn
7718937 ik wil wel gaan studeren maar dan meer om de verbreding van mijn kennis en niet per se omdat ik een andere baan wil ik wil later gewoon meiden en jongens helpen in de muziekwereld
7718938 wie is christian walz ik ken hem helemaal niet maar ik ben niet zenuwachtig en ik heb helemaal niets te maken met de andere artiesten het gaat erom dat wij een goede show neerzetten die avond
7718939 ja maar niet meer dan elk ander meisje ik heb veel van carhartt en h amp m ik heb weinig design kleding ik werk samen met kledingwinkel yoi die verschillende kledingmerken verkopen dus krijg ik regelmatig wat van hun
7718940 ik vind paradiso leuk de melkweg is ook cool want daar heerst een warme underground sfeer maar de paradiso is net iets groter en mooier qua zaal ik voel me daar erg thuis
7718941 ik wil gewoon naar voren gebracht worden hoe ik ben en niet als een soort marionetpoppetje ik ben gewoon wie ik ben en meer volwassen dan dat ik was in de tijd van zinloos er is niks mis met jongeren aanspreken dat is gewoon cool maar ik wil daarvan losbreken en ook andere mensen aan kunnen spreken van bijvoorbeeld mijn eigen leeftijd en niet dat ik naast sita en kim lian op nickelodeon wordt gezet
7718942 o ja ik ben wel een keer pharell tegen gekomen bij een hotel en heb toen met hem gepraat maar ik moet nog maar zien ik heb hem helaas geen muziek van me kunnen laten horen
7718943 stevie wonder lijkt me supervet en in nederland wil ik graag met perquisite van pete philly amp perquisite samenwerken en ook wel delic van opgezwolle dat zijn mijn twee favoriete producers van nederland
7718944 dat is nog niet duidelijk ik en mijn management hebben zo eigen idee n het wordt in ieder geval heel vet en ik sla een iets andere weg in
7718945 het maakt niet zoveel uit of je heel goed of een beetje goed bent als je het maar graag wilt je moet gewoon zorgen dat je overal bent en je gezicht laat zien en overal waar een open podium of open mic is moet je gewoon wezen mensen gaan je dan op een gegeven moment herkennen je moet contacten leggen en netwerken dan kom je er wel
7718946 je bent niet de eerste die het vraagt mijn moeder heeft mij die naam gegeven aan het begin van mijn carri re toen ik voor het eerst ging draaien in 1988 op een groot housefeest in de jan van galenhal moest ik een artiestennaam hebben en ik wist niks zelf te bedenken dus ik vroeg het mijn moeder the prophet kwam uit een boek dat ze aan het lezen was en sindsdien heb ik die naam aangehouden ik kwam er eigenlijk niet meer onderuit het feest was zon succes en werd steeds vaker geboekt
7718947 ze begrepen het niet mijn ouders waren wel trots ze begrijpen de muziek niet maar waarderen mij wel en over de drugs maken ze zich ook niet druk ze weten hoe ik ben ze hebben wel vertrouwen in me
7718948 ik ben normaal een beetje rustig vind ik zelf ik gedraag me op het podium gewoon anders dan in het dagelijkse leven op het podium moet je een beetje stoer over komen en in het dagelijkse leven hoeft dat niet per se the prophet is gewoon een act en ik ga ook niet dagelijks in een raar kostuum lopen ik vind het helemaal niks die dingen maar op een sensation black is dat leuk
7718949 met osdorp posse ben ik ooit begonnen ik doe heel af en toe wat hiphop dingen maar je moet je gewoon concentreren op een bepaalde stijl anders ga je allemaal verschillende dingen doen waardoor je je niet 200 op een ding kan richten om het te perfectioneren ik vind bijna alles leuk ik houd van hiphop hardcore hardstyle klassiek dance progressive electro noem het maar op trance raakt me alleen niet sommige trance platen hebben wel iets het gaat me ook meer om een goede plaat en niet om een bepaald genre een plaat heeft iets of het heeft niets
7718950 ja ik wil mijn fans ook niet teleurstellen mensen bezoeken shows van artiesten voor de bepaalde muziekstijl waar de artiest om bekend staat het is belangrijk dat het publiek weet waar ze aan toe zijn het klopt dat ik door de jaren heen verschillende acts heb gedaan the rose doe ik eigenlijk al een jaartje of tien niet meer dat was in die tijd club muziek ik draai nu de laatste jaren af en toe progressive onder de naam rokkwild rustiger dan hardstyle meer voor een wat ouder publiek
7718951 ik probeer zo min mogelijk te verwachten dan kan het alleen maar meevallen vorig jaar kreeg ik alleen maar goede reacties stel nou dat ik het helemaal geweldig vind en ik wordt helemaal afgezeken dat kan gebeuren het maakt ook niet uit wat ik vind en gaat er om wat het publiek wilt zonder fans is een dj niets
7718952 white was met 40 000 kaarten binnen drie uur uitverkocht dus ik denk het nog niet black is nog niet uitverkocht dat ligt aan het hardstyle publiek die staan er om bekend op het laatste moment te beslissen ergens heen te gaan de concurrentie is ook hoog de gedachtegang hoe duncan stutterheim oprichter id amp t red het concept van sensation uit vind ik wel heel mooi
7718953 standaard maar wel goed ik vind het wel een vreemde move van rob gee om kurtis blow mee te nemen het sensation publiek kent hem niet ik ken hem wel en ik vind hem een held maar het heeft in mijn ogen geen toegevoegde waarde aan het feest rob gee gaat volgens mij rock doen en daar zitten mensen denk ik niet op te wachten
7718954 ik ben een keer naar white geweest en ik vond het heel vet en bijzonder mooie mensen gezellig en een goede sfeer maar black spreekt me meer aan ik houd van muziek met ballen en bij white sta ik een beetje om me heen te kijken het publiek gaat daar niet echt los dat vind ik jammer
7718955 als ik al vrije tijd heb dan bezoek ik geen hardstyle maar progressive feesten ik hoor dana of zany al op andere feesten waar ik draai ik vind het leuk om me bezig te houden met het grafische vak beetje illustraten en photoshop vrije tijd is voornamelijk om te chillen voornamelijk met mijn vriendin
7718956 ik wil die ene wereldhit nog eens maken niet alleen een hit in nederland maar ook wereldwijd in nederland kennen ze me nu wel het is ook leuk om een keer onverwachts uit de hoek te komen ik zou het dan alleen niet onder de naam the prophet uit kunnen brengen helaas
7718957 i make enough money to hire someone to write this speech for me
7718958 but each of us also comes here tonight by way of our own improbable journey i come here tonight as a sister blessed with a brother who is my mentor my protector and my lifelong friend i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world theyre the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning and the last thing i think about when i go to bed at night their future and all our childrens future is my stake in this election and i come here as a daughter raised on the south side of chicago by a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me my mothers love has always been a sustaining force for our family and one of my greatest joys is seeing her integrity her compassion and her intelligence reflected in my own daughters
7718959 and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7718960 and in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital ten years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love

7718970 its a device for trapping lions in the scottish highlands
7718971 its one of those japanime shows about giant robots right
7718972 i prefer more slice of life shows mself azumanga daioh is probably my favorite but theres a bunch of others too shows like hidamari sketch is awfully good and i would have loved another season of sketchbook though i cant imagine itll ever make it over here im very happy that aria was licensed by nozomi though i havent pre ordered it yet somedays dreamers is pretty decent too im working through that one now its no cardcaptor sakura though but then what is but yknow shows like toshokan sensou are a treat and noir is one of the best shows ive ever seen and those arent really slice of life and then you have the classics like right came out in the early 90s maybe a little before your time oh yeah and dont forget the legendary gunsmith cats ova cant go wrong with girls with guns right

7718981 as painful as it will be for him he needs to come clean
7718982 today the differences between andrew rice and his opponent republican sen jim inhofe became even clearer
7718983 this is a classic example of why americans have lost faith in washington
7718984 senator stevens has been very generous to his good friend jim inhofe whom we know is also close to big oil companies now we know that the money may be tainted and i believe our senator needs to come clean
7718985 even though senator stevens legal problems have been known for more than a year senator inhofe still agreed to take his contributions
7718986 if he wants oklahomans to believe he is not part of the problem in washington inhofe should return the contributions he received from his indicted friend
7718987 oklahomans are tired of the cozy relationship between senators and lobbyists in washington and the stevens case is
7718988 sales improved significantly in july 2008 and remained above the 400 000 level for the third consecutive month
7718989 deeply discounted distressed sales continue to drive volume in many regions of the state july also was the first full month during which the effects of higher 729 000 conforming loan limits likely had an impact on closed sales
7718990 year to year increases in the number of transactions ranged from a 6 7 percent increase in the san francisco bay area to a 176 5 percent increase in the riverside san bernardino region
7718991 in general greater percentage gains occurred in lower priced areas that had been most adversely affected by the market downturn since late 2005 and that are concurrently experiencing the biggest declines in prices
7718992 once again the 40 3 percent year to year decrease in the median price of a home was an all time record surpassing the previous record set in june with a 37 9 percent decrease
7718993 since the statewide median remained in the 585 000 595 000 range through august of last year the market will continue to experience significant year to year adjustments through august even if the median price holds steady over the next few months
7718994 the statewide median was last in the 350 000 range in early 2003
7718995 the gay community has infiltrated the very centers of power in every area across this country and they wield extreme power that agenda is the greatest threat to our freedom that we face today why do you think we see the rationalization for abortion and multiple sexual partners thats a gay agenda
7718996 i favor the death penalty for abortionists and other people who take life
7718997 we need someone who will speak morally on the issues and not run from the criticism of the national press we need to have moral clarity about our leaders i have a 100 percent pro life record i dont apologize for saying we need to protect the unborn do you realize that if all those children had not been aborted we wouldnt have any trouble with medicare and social security today thats another 41 million people
7718998 if i wanted to buy a bazooka to use in a very restricted way to do something i ought to be able to do that
7718999 thousands of palestinian fighters recently trained in how to kidnap zionist soldiers
7719000 could i just mention to you jay that in a moment of seriousness i spent five and a half years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair
7719001 i spent those five and half years not because i wanted to get a house when i got back home
7719002 hes a guy who barely got out of high school fought in world war ii in the army came home and made a business and made the american dream
7719003 we spend our time in a condominium in washington a condominium in phoenix some time over here in the state of california and then we have a place up in northern arizona
7719004 and my friends im proud of my record of service to this country and it has nothing to do with houses
7719005 the white house was saved by the action of one brave soldier john mccain
7719006 i know youve been asking about who i want to be my running mate
7719007 wouldnt it be good to have a person you dont know what party theyre with they have no political principles whatsoever they may need a job about that time
7719008 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7719009 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7719010 i know this is not coming from barack obama but his supporters are helping us decide who to vote for
7719011 i hate the feeling that you shouldnt wear your hillary gear unless there are two or three of you together
7719012 i cant imagine not going into a convention and hearing alabama and the whole world looking up to see what comes next
7719013 but as typical of these roll calls at a certain point somebody has the votes and the protocol and graciousness come through and that will have its own dynamic
7719014 it really shook him up he and i both essentially went through high school and college fantasizing about christina applegate so at first he was really excited like dude i totally get to see christina applegate nude but i guess the trauma of realizing that he drove a dagger into the collective heart of men everywhere by cutting off the very things that helped him through the rough spots of puberty was just too much for him
7719015 it started out kind of funny actually she was lying there on the table unconscious he was joking around check it out im finally getting to touch kelly bundys boobs but then you could almost see a kind of black cloud of realization drift over him as i handed him the scalpel and he remembered the task at hand when it was all said and done he just stood there for awhile then screamed what have i done and ran out of the room crying
7719016 estoy aqu como una esposa que ama a su marido y cree que ser un presidente extraordinario
7719017 following my suspension by the general medical council i have been informed that the greater glasgow and clyde health board has taken legal advice and may cancel my contract to provide medical services this means i will no longer be able to work as a general practitioner at all in future my staff will also lose their jobs
7719018 necessary to send a message to the medical profession that this behaviour is unacceptable
7719019 the panel is of the opinion that you allowed your views in respect of physician assisted suicide to influence your treatment of patient a you made a serious misjudgment and embarked upon a potentially criminal act
7719020 they indicated that they were considering terminating my contract and since then ive been told that they are looking at it quite seriously
7719021 obviously i dont want that to happen im 62 now and dont think i could cope with starting up a new practice i understand there will be another meeting next week but have been told not to expect good news
7719022 oh by the way the rentals start in five minutes
7719023 we just have to always remember that what isnt paid by system development charges are paid by the rest of the ratepayers so whatever is delayed by systems development charges coul
7719024 we just have to always remember that what isnt paid by system development charges are paid by the rest of the ratepayers so whatever is delayed by systems development charges could become a burden on the rest of t

7719027 several soldiers who deserted after a tour of duty in iraq have stated that cruelty towards iraqi citizens was a factor in their desertions one of them lance corporal ivan brobeck witnessed the abuse of iraqi detainees and the killing of iraqi civilians another sgt ricky clousing had similar experiences his allegations of systematic abuse of iraqi detainees are now being investigated by the military
7719028 during the trial long 25 of boise idaho said he fled when his unit was deployed to iraq because he felt it was an illegal war according to cbc prosecutors on the other hand said he abandoned his duty and his country
7719029 showed a six minute video of long sporting dreadlocks and a beard telling a canadian news reporter i think i was lied to by my president
7719030 i think they want to prosecute him for free speech issues without actually charging him
7719031 was against the law arguing that justified longs fleeing to canada the lone character witness called to speak for long was peter haney with the pikes peak justice and peace commission he had met the soldier three times while long was awaiting trial in the el paso county colo lockup
7719032 ive observed mr long in situations that would be trying to just about anyone he seemed to me to be extremely poised and lucid
7719033 i feel the war on terror is a war on peace
7719034 the morality of what he did should lessen the punishment
7719035 about two dozen anti war supporters gathered around the courthouse at fort carson in colorado springs colo yesterday afternoon as a military judge handed down longs sentence
7719036 the applicant submits that if returned to the united states he will be court martialed for desertion and he will be incarcerated in a military prison where like stephen funk camilo mejia and kevin benderman he will suffer persecution and cruel and inhumane treatment
7719037 i believe the evidence here shows that if returned to the us the applicant will suffer the harm he has described

7719040 we believe that such a raid could not have taken place unless mr maliki had at least prior knowledge of it
7719041 the body of the martyr abbas ali hmoud will stay in the building until the iillers are captured
7719042 ordered the formation of a committee to find out how iraqi forces came to fight each other in baquba
7719043 hussein al zubaidi a provincial council member and nazar al khafaji the diyala university dean were arrested during the raid the official said
7719044 taha dria a shiite lawmaker from diyala who was not in the government compound during the raid said the armed forces were from iraqs emergency response unit an american trained unit similar to u s special forces
7719045 they were wearing khaki their weapons were american the humvees they used looked american they didnt have any ranks on their shoulders they didnt talk
7719046 these special forces work with the americans they are not associated with the ministry of defense they have goals and they didnt inform anyone else
7719047 that all us troops will leave by the end of 2011
7719048 i know there are always reports out there in the press and im not sure i saw exactly what prime minister maliki said but clearly from our perspective weve been working with the iraqi government for a long time on this agreement were discussing goals as you know youve heard us speak about different kinds of timelines or aspirational goals that may be acceptable i dont have anything to announce on that an agreement has not been signed and so from our perspective there is no agreement until theres an agreement signed there are discussions that continue in baghdad wed like to let them continue and to continue to show progress what were focused on is getting a good agreement not getting an agreement by a particular date so well continue those discussions
7719049 out of the more than 151 000 families who had fled their houses in baghdad just 7 112 had returned to them by mid july according to the iraqi ministry of migration
7719050 the reasons for the hesitation are complex based on dangers both real and imagined in most cases iraqis say they feel safe with their neighbors but are not sure about other residents some are afraid of the new guards on their blocks in rarer cases they cannot face neighbors who they suspect helped in killings
7719051 i just lost my brother but i pray to god to save my son
7719052 a multi national division baghdad soldier died of wounds aug 25 at a coalition forces combat army support hospital the soldier was shot by a small arms attack during a dismounted patrol in northern baghdad the soldier was quickly transported to the medical faciality but later succumbed to the wounds
7719053 wmc needs to be read and we wanted to note it sunday but couldnt fit it
7719054 burden the original decision of the woman and the physician
7719055 would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute
7719056 as i understand it this puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing this procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to think that its nonviable but theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved
7719057 if this is a child then this would be an antiabortion statute
7719058 obama is a father of two young girls you can bet that attacks like that will get him or any father riled up that language seems to be way over the top his critics can paint him as a pro choice liberal thats fair but to go any further is really beyond the pale is obama really sinister a monster
7719059 stick with me were still moving forward the rain is coming
7719060 there would be no chance for mr heim to take control of his fathers money as long as there is no hint or proof for mr heims demise there is no legal basis for german authorities to declare him dead
7719061 i do not see any way the kids can inherit the bank account of their father
7719062 as long as we dont know he is dead we have to assume hes still alive
7719063 we are staying tuned to his case as we are talking about very cruel crimes
7719064 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
7719065 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
7719066 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
7719067 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
7719068 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
7719069 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
7719070 i detest what you write but i would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write
7719071 and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too
7719072 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
7719073 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground

7719092 for measuring propagation of lightning energy from the surface of the earth to the mine cavern 300 feet below the drive signal was applied to a long wire stretched on the surface directly below inside the mine an antenna was set up to pick up the transmitted signals multiple antenna measurements were made covering a cross pattern in the mine of about 80 meters by 80 meters the measurements were compared to analytical models simulating lightning field propagation through the earth the data was used to develop transfer functions a way of understanding how much energy penetrated into the mine based on a surface lightning events these results were combined with a theoretical lightning strike waveform to determine if voltages get high enough inside the mine to be of concern the study concluded that it was highly unlikely that lightning initiated the explosion by traveling along conductors through the mine and into the sealed area however electromagnetic energy from a significant lightning event close to the sealed area could travel through the ground at sago and induce a high voltage into metallic conductors that were left in the sealed section of the mine a pump cable was left abandoned at the ignition point this cable was found by msha investigators to have many damaged sections that could provide a spark when the cable is subjected to high voltages a spark is a known ignition source of flammable methane mixtures that can accumulate in sealed sections of mines

7719230 i think it was one of the most moving events that i have ever witnessed and i think we all love ted kennedy
7719231 he has been a stalwart and he is a very good friend and he clearly thought it was very important to deliver the message to make it clear that a torch has been passed to the next generation and as someone who has heard jack kennedy say that it was very moving
7719232 and that was reinforced watching him tonight i just felt very moved
7719233 i had never ever seen such a stirring speech in my life
7719234 i take away from it that there is hope that the greatest nation in the world have people who can actually bring change for a better world

7719254 we had no contact with the mackay family for quite some time
7719255 apparently they had made contact a while ago but no one here recalled it we really had to find their family after we read about it in the paper
7719256 the mackay family are unique this family has been to the community for support and theyve received it from the town of louisdale theyve spent a lot of their own personal finance but once you get into that long length of time six nine 12 months it seems to me that it is reasonable that we really look at how we can provide additional support to those people
7719257 as far as amounts that is private at this point
7719258 we got you out of there safely well relatively and thats the job
7719259 the job sod the job my friends are in danger
7719260 harry stop you might be able to get through the wards but theres a different protection around them called a scattering charm i promise you if you get through you will be splinched beyond all recognition they will not be able to put you back together again
7719261 you cant its a one way trip once i activated the portkey the wards around the safe house activated and nobody gets in or out for four hours your friends are going to be fine garry and anton were there there were other ministry aurors in the room theres a blue line floo connection to the aurors office they will contact us as soon as they realize what happened to make sure youre okay well ask about them then trust me its going to be okay
7719262 er im sorry about shoving you like that are you okay
7719263 harry could you give me a hand its not exactly easy to get yourself up from your backside when youre wearing these things
7719264 i want you to lean on me im going to take you into the sitting room and im going to put you on the sofa
7719265 dont be such a caveman just let me help you
7719266 i know y oure fine but humor me while i take care of your knee all right im no healer but i know enough to make you comfortable
7719267 look im not going to tell anyone you let me take care of you but im not going to sit here and let your knee get worse either i need to take a look at it
7719268 well its just that date was a disaster and you know we kind of broke up after i wouldnt think youd want to remember it
7719269 we didnt break up after that we broke up after marietta ratted out the da and i failed to understand what she had really done i have very fond memories of that date up until the point i made an idiot out of myself
7719270 yeah im sorry about that im a bit of an idiot when it comes to women i should have been more sensitive im afraid i needed to have the problem explained to me in detail by hermione before i figured out what id done wrong
7719271 it wasnt your fault harry i was being stupid i thought if i acted a little jealous and stormed out you would come after me which would get us out of madame puddifoots where you clearly werent happy and give you an opportunity to tell me how you felt about me without a lot of pressure it was such a perfect plan except for the part where i didnt share it with you and you didnt follow me then i got my feelings really hurt when you didnt care enough to chase me
7719272 but really harry it was my fault i was the one playing games
7719273 no we fell when i had to portkey out without warning him
7719274 he needs some pain potion and some treatment for swelling i suspect he should see a healer in the morning but i dont think its urgent im inspecting the injury now
7719275 can you tell us if anyone was hurt in the attack please
7719276 the attacker you subdued was transported to st mungos for trauma to his chest another attacker suffered a grade three concussion and was treated before being taken into ministry holding there were several minor injuries reported due to the panicked crowd but no one else required transportation to st mungos the next most severe injury was the broken hand that occurred when the gentleman caused the concussion but he assured us his wife could treat it when he returned home
7719277 thank you any word on what was behind the attack
7719278 i would prefer not to speculate ms chang you will be notified once we have a chance to interrogate the men involved
7719279 i told you harry everyone is fine as soon as we got you out there was no reason for any of the attackers to continue fighting it was the safest thing for everyone just to get you out especially you
7719280 i still would have preferred to just stay and deal with it
7719281 of course you would thats you but my job is to make sure youre safe no matter what i didnt want to upset you but i had to think of the mission first ive sworn an oath to protect you remember
7719282 yeah thanks for asking about them at least im glad nobody was hurt but i want to check on everyone as soon as i can its my fault they were in danger
7719283 harry dont blame yourself it was the fault of the idiots who attacked you not yours what i want to know is how they knew you were going to be there it was top secret information i promise well check on your friends first thing in the morning
7719284 i suspect they will come down just before five we should get you patched up so you can get some sleep we will head back to the burrow in the morning and you can floo them from there okay
7719285 this one is a sleeping potion you can take it in a bit i need to get a look at your knee
7719286 give the pain potion a chance to take effect and then ill give it a look im going to go see if i have any ice i can put on this
7719287 sorry i took so long but i didnt have any ice so i had to use magic on some ice cube trays has the pain potion started working
7719288 im not sure my knee isnt that bad you shouldnt fuss over it
7719289 my principle got hurt on my watch im allowed to make a fuss
7719290 well i was yuki until i came to hogwarts i was two when we moved from hong kong and my mom provided the first two names she had always called me yuki and it never bothered me until i got to grade school and everyone called me yucky chang for whatever reason the name stuck and i thought i was destined to go through life as yucky chang when i got my hogwarts letter i decided to go with cho its harder to tease me about
7719291 thats how people know me now and everybody but my boss and my mother respect that
7719292 thanks for telling me i know what its like to have a difficult childhood
7719293 yes you do and i dont i had a very happy childhood the teasing wasnt a big deal it was never that spiteful i just wanted to start fresh when i got to hogwarts i would never compare my childhood to yours
7719294 oh well dont believe everything you heard from there it was patently unreliable
7719295 i dont but i heard enough to know some things about you padma and parvati were sisters they talked a lot but since i know you never confessed your love for parvati i know its not all true
7719296 well mister i know youve been waiting your whole life to hear me say this but take your trousers off
7719297 i need to examine your knee and you need to stop being such a brat about it
7719298 yes i know youre fine heres the deal either you take your trousers off nicely and i examine your knee like someone whose job it is to take care of you or i wrestle you for them personally i hope you choose the latter because a wrestling match on the couch with harry sounds like a perfect end to my evening the choice is yours whats it going to be
7719299 i dont really make a habit of sitting around the homes of women dressed in just my pants youll have to excuse me
7719300 come on harry off with the trousers im not joking i need to look at your knee if you want ill promise not to peek
7719301 but stop making jokes and keep your eyes to yourself
7719302 no bad harry these are my souvenir and youre never getting these back
7719303 well either youre going to be fine and should probably see a healer in the morning to get your ligaments examined or you have only a few hours to live one or the other i cant tell which with the tools available to me just in case is there anything youve ever really wanted to do before you expire something that could be accomplished in just a few hours perhaps
7719304 i told you i was fine but you wouldnt believe me
7719305 you know there are more answers to that question than fine or im nearly dead
7719306 oh come on im just trying to lighten the mood a little id prefer you to be comfortable youre the first guest ive had here in years id like it if you had an enjoyable time that way you might even want to even come back sometime
7719307 you need to keep ice on this for at least thirty minutes to help with the swelling but i tell you what im going to go change into something less formal maybe then you wont feel so underdressed okay
7719308 i know i wasnt properly your date tonight but thanks for showing me such a wonderful time at least until those idiots showed up and ruined it it was almost like we finally got our date to the yule ball it was lovely
7719309 didnt you ever wonder harry what it would have been like if things hadnt been so messed up sixth year if we hadnt fumbled so badly if id been a little smarter about things didnt you ever want to know what wed have been like
7719310 but you had a crush on me for years before anything happened surely you must have
7719311 my life was so uncertain i really never thought about things like that i just wanted to stay alive for the next school year
7719312 so do you think you and i will ever have a chance
7719313 then how come the two of you arent together she obviously loves you if you both want to be together then why arent you already
7719314 its only complicated because you make it complicated this right here this is simple i like you harry i always have if you want her then be with her if you dont want to be with her then please lets just see whats between us weve danced around this the whole time weve known each other wouldnt you like to know
7719315 youre right i do like you i always have and yes i think youre pretty and i had a crush on you in school but thats all nothing ever came of it we kissed once we had one date its been years cho i thought wed both moved on havent we
7719316 i was angry harry merlin dont you know anything about women
7719317 have i ever made a decision i didnt later regret
7719318 ive never been very good with regret after cedric and then you i just sort of stopped trying i mean the thing with michael was less than nothing i just cant seem to get close to anyone anymore everybody ive ever gone out with i just end up comparing them to you or cedric and they seem so i dont know hollow i guess i try but theres never anything there after hogwarts i became an auror because i thought you might notice me i joined the order of the phoenix because i wanted to protect you then i took this job and i hoped maybe wed rekindle things but mostly i just wanted to be a part of your life you know
7719319 i dont want to be just an ex girlfriend or a bodyguard if i cant be something more can we at least be friends
7719320 we can try i mean i hardly know anything about you really
7719321 you know i was the second best seeker in the history of hogwarts
7719322 well thats what i tell my dad anyway he was heartbroken that i never beat you to a snitch
7719323 hell get over it someday its better than listening to my mum go on and on about my biological clock
7719324 im so sorry about last night i was awful to you and then i wanted to dance with you and it just
7719325 it all just got ruined im just relieved you arent hurt
7719326 right like youre such a credible witness that im going to believe you
7719327 scoff scoff scoff scoff you are a terrible liar now shush ill be back in a sec
7719328 nothing i told ginny it wasnt a big deal i just wrenched my knee a little
7719329 he bloody well better not be or im going to cover you in bruises
7719330 ginny nothing happened she gave me some pain potion and some ice i slept on the couch
7719331 seriously harry either you take them off or i cut them off
7719332 no this is my room you get out of here
7719333 harry deserves privacy give me a minute to check him and then ron and i will go back to bed so you and harry can talk okay
7719334 well i dont know what cho gave you and you cant mix pain potions
7719335 you cant leave the two of them alone in her room
7719336 first of all ron they are both adults and they can do whatever they want secondly harry isnt in any condition to ravage your sister thirdly
7719337 yeah i know i used to have one just like it last time i saw it it was a rather smart button down though
7719338 now that you mention it i noticed just the other day that one of my favorite pairs of boxers had gone missing i dont have many clothes you see so i notice these things
7719339 i have noticed that you dont have much of a selection
7719340 are you actually planning to ravage me in my own bedroom
7719341 well ill have to check my social calendar ive been seeing this guy you know
7719342 harry dont be daft it was a joke i spend all my free time with you ive spent more nights at the burrow in the last month than i have combined since i finally escaped that prison
7719343 of course i will go out on a date with you
7719344 truthfully it kind of bothers me you still thought id say no what exactly is it you think ive been waiting for all this time
7719345 it doesnt matter someplace romantic would be nice but if youre taking me id go anywhere
7719346 ive been meaning to talk to you for the last couple of weeks but its been hard to get you alone
7719347 nothings wrong its just well hermione said some things to make me realize what an idiot i was being
7719348 i dont know what you mean its my fault weve
7719349 i act like i dont sometimes and i dont know why ive known harry in here
7719350 even if you never say it i can tell and it isnt fair that ive questioned that im sorry
7719351 things have been such a mess i mean its confusing sometimes even i dont know what im feeling
7719352 not really i get angry and it clouds things sometimes but i always know how you feel about me always
7719353 im sorry ginny youve lost me how can you know
7719354 did you know what it was did you know what it does
7719355 yes it did but it belongs to me now its quite easily the most amazing gift ive ever received
7719356 its entirely possible that this is the most amazing gift any man has ever given a woman
7719357 ill explain but this is going to take a little time so be patient
7719358 back before the founding of hogwarts when rowena ravenclaw was still a very young witch she was in love
7719359 in an effort to comfort her garanwyn had his family make this ring the ring was his promise to young rowena that he would always love her and that he would return to marry her the ring is enchanted so that if true love exists between the giver and receiver as long as that love remains the wearer of the ring can feel the life force of the person who gave it to them it also provides several different protections to the wearer she cannot be forced to harm her beloved it provides protection for the witches erm virtue with anyone but her beloved and in the event that her beloved is killed she cannot be harmed at the hand of the person who killed him
7719360 garanwyn didnt make it back from that war he was gone for almost two years and when he was struck down rowena knew the moment it happened simply put she was bereft her heart never recovered from the loss of garanwyn she wore the ring for the rest of her life eventually the dark forces were put down and she went on to found a school with two other wizards and a witch to try and rebuild the magical community the ring passed to rowenas niece upon her death and it remained in that part of the family passing from mother to daughter eventually the magical portion of that family died out and rowenas jewelry came to be in the hands of a muggle that tom killed when he took the tiara apparently the ring was better hidden hermione says you found it in a shop and purchased it when you sent it to me for christmas you reactivated the magic when i wore it for the first time the enchantment was sealed and i immediately knew something was very different i could feel you harry i dont know exactly how i knew it was you but i did
7719361 you cant know how it felt to feel your presence again after missing it every day for four months
7719362 you can imagine my reaction given my history with enchanted objects it scared me but when i tried to take it back off i found that it wouldnt budge
7719363 this ring is the only thing thats kept me sane while you were gone if you are sorry for giving it to me it would hurt me more than you can possibly imagine
7719364 ive never done anything with the intention of hurting you
7719365 so once i accepted that it wasnt going to come off and i was sure that it was you that i was feeling i wore it proudly i waited much like rowena had for you to return to me once you had finished your task like garanwyn you did not
7719366 i finally decided to research the ring after you disappeared
7719367 i always knew before anyone else knew i always knew you were close i swear sometimes it felt like you were right next to me
7719368 im sorry i dont remember any of my trips back to see ron and hermione theyve mentioned them but i dont remember them
7719369 harry ive had the benefit of knowing that you loved me these last nine years unfortunately while i think youve needed them just as much you havent gotten the same assurances please know there wasnt one day while you were gone that my feelings wavered these last few weeks have reminded me of something important i want us harry whatever us takes however long this takes i want you and i to be together and im no longer willing to let the past dictate the terms of our future
7719370 that means that whatever happened while we were apart i accept it as long as you follow a couple of rules
7719371 the rules are that we have no more secrets i want the whole package harry all the warts and scars rule number two is no more running away from me we face our problems together its okay to be scared or angry but whatever youre feeling you have to stay and work it out with me if you say yes then i wont be shielded from the hurt or the ugly moments no more censoring your life from me
7719372 ginny its not that simple there are things things you shouldnt have to know
7719373 i dont care those are my terms can you do that
7719374 its just well we need something to build on and you need to know i wont quit loving you i promise
7719375 i cant promise ill never hold anything back but ill try to be less
7719376 i was going to go with guarded but i mean as long as were shooting for the stars why not
7719377 oh harry im so sorry i just got carried away
7719378 we have our whole lives for that harry we can at least wait until you can enjoy it
7719379 the document is a draft shared for comment and were pleased to get some comment back initially from coun hall and we expect that members of the citizen liaison committee and anyone else who reviews it will provide some comment
7719380 would not support construction of any form or development of any of these lands in the long term
7719381 all of the design features well keep in mind for future use but at the same time our first priority is to maintain the integrity of the cap
7719382 if that means someone cant build a basement then they wont be permitted to build a basement and they will be notified before they buy any property or lease
7719383 to the best of our knowledge we have the accused in custody and are satisfied there are no other suspects
7719384 we are waiting for the results of the autopsy which will confirm cause of death
7719385 all we can say right now is that it is being classified as a homicide
7719386 the call came in of a 44 year old male in distress
7719387 some were still there when police arrived some had left we are in the process of tracking them down to be interviewed
7719388 i heard some screaming some time around 1 a m i thought they were just drinking there and went back to bed
7719389 it scares me half to death to see that yellow tape i havent spoke to police yet so i dont know what is going on
7719390 we have never had a problem they are all nice people all friends of the family
7719391 if anything was going on that shouldnt i can guarantee they wouldnt know about it because they wouldnt put up with it they run a beautiful campground
7719392 someone was banging on my door and when i got up and opened it all i saw was police cars everywhere i was wondering what was going on
7719393 we are in a predominantly advertising driven business and there are cycles
7719394 it wont necessarily be the same as the apn model it might be a fairfax version of that process
7719395 this is my first convention so i have no idea what this will be like
7719396 like me he was raised by a single parent for the first few years of his life like me hes been a community organizer he gets the struggles of everyday montanans
7719397 she actually got more votes in this election than anybody did
7719398 senator baucus who is the senior member of our delegation may do it governor schweitzer certainly has reason to think that maybe he should do it and actually in the end i may actually decide that
7719399 i am very proud of senator clinton and all her supporters she solidly cracked the glass ceiling and set an amazing example for a woman presidential candidate
7719400 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7719401 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7719402 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7719403 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7719404 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7719405 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7719406 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7719407 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7719408 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7719409 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7719410 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7719411 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7719412 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7719413 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7719414 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7719415 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7719416 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7719417 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7719418 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7719419 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7719420 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7719421 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7719422 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7719423 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7719424 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7719425 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7719426 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7719427 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7719428 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7719429 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7719430 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7719431 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7719432 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7719433 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7719434 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7719435 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7719436 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7719437 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7719438 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7719439 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7719440 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7719441 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7719442 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7719443 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7719444 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7719445 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7719446 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7719447 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7719448 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7719449 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7719450 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7719451 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7719452 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7719453 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7719454 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7719455 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7719456 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7719457 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7719458 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7719459 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7719460 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7719461 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7719462 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7719463 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7719464 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7719465 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7719466 who are open to doing something on the production side
7719467 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7719468 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7719469 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7719470 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7719471 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7719472 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7719473 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7719474 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7719475 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7719476 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7719477 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7719478 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7719479 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7719480 media companies fit for the modern media world need to be lean and agile
7719481 this far reaching program will position us well for the next stage of our growth and development
7719482 this initiative has been carefully constructed by the publishers with full regard for the integrity of their mastheads our newspapers will remain true to their heritage and their values of quality and excellence
7719483 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world theyre the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning and the last thing i think about when i go to bed at night their future and all our childrens future is my stake in this election
7719484 and i come here as a daughter raised on the south side of chicago by a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me my mothers love has always been a sustaining force for our family and one of my greatest joys is seeing her integrity her compassion and her intelligence reflected in my own daughters
7719485 he and my mom poured everything they had into me and craig it was the greatest gift a child can receive never doubting for a single minute that youre loved and cherished and have a place in this world and thanks to their faith and hard work we both were able to go on to college so i know firsthand from their lives and mine that the american dream endures
7719486 alked about the world as it is and the world as it should be
7719487 its the story of men and women gathered in churches and union halls in town squares and high school gyms people who stood up and marched and risked everything they had refusing to settle determined to mold our future into the shape of our ideals
7719488 it is because of their will and determination that this week we celebrate two anniversaries the 88th anniversary of women winning the right to vote and the 45th anniversary of that hot summer day when dr king lifted our sights and our hearts with his dream for our nation
7719489 i stand here today at the crosscurrents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me

7719609 who threaten the stability not only in pakistran but also afghanistan
7719610 the ppp also violated the latest agreement reached earlier this month that the judges will be restored 24 hours after the resignation of musharraf

7719620 number one they need to import a large amount of wheat
7719621 if they need wheat right now the us is the place to go
7719622 the idea of that in 2000 was to promote certain types of exports to sanctioned countries so there would be food medicine agricultural products medical products
7719623 it is still surprising that they are buying wheat from the us instead of waiting to buy wheat from someone else
7719624 maybe the relationship between iran and the us is not as terrible as it has been
7719625 iran is more interested in showing to its people that it is not restrained by sanctions
7719626 the real signal is look were doing fine we can buy wheat from the us

7719647 that was a real confidence booster we came out of the tournament after beating corning knowing that we can play against anyone because we just beat a team of 16 year olds
7719648 knowing each so well weve played together and against each other all of our lives helps a lot because we know each other and can always trust each other on giving good advice and cheering each other up if we make a mistake and we have fun along with it
7719649 ten of the 11 girls on the team are lockport kids so it was a big confidence boost for them playing against older girls and beating them

7719690 alright diggers those who didnt see an assasination plot for obama happening by white supremacists please raise your hand
7719691 oh wow obama is amazing hes gonna get jobs for everyone hes gonna do this hes gonna do that
7719692 those who would sacrifice essential liberties for a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
7719693 i believe a good example of this is massive citizen surveilance itll give you a little temporary safety for as long as it takes the criminals to notice the surveilance cams shortly thereafter criminals simply find ways around the surveilance cameras and now criminals are still criminals but honest citizens no longer have any privacy the same could be said for gun control outlawing guns will only give you some temporary safety as long it takes for the criminals to get guns illegally so now criminals still have guns but you as a citizen have lost a very essential liberty and have also lost a massive amount of safety in losing the ability to protect yourself with weapons to match those of the criminals

7719715 id rather have a technology that allows us to use fossil fuels without destroying the planet because people are going to use them anyway
7719716 our position is we need to start phasing out coal as soon as possible
7719717 if co2 emission reduction is a goal then investigating and investing in strategies for capitalizing on our existing infrastructure efficiently and effectively makes more sense than throwing away reasonable options simply because they dont align with a political philosophy about our energy economy
7719718 this is just one more piece of evidence that environmentalists arent concerned about solving a problem
7719719 every problem as they see it is one way to restrict peoples lifestyles and if you come up with a technological fix that can solve a problem but doesnt require sacrifice and lets us go about our business the way we were before theyre not happy about it even if it solves the problem
7719720 now i dont know about whether this technology will solve global warming
7719721 but lets say it is cost effective and lets assume for the sake of argument that global warming is a real serious problem that needs to be solved then i would argue that this technology may be a good thing
7719722 for me the objective is reducing the harmful effects of climate change it is going to be extremely challenging to reduce co2 levels to the point where we can stabilize the stock of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at say 550 ppm parts per million and this is only a mild goal
7719723 most environmentalists would like to see a much more stringent goal
7719724 if we want to have a reasonable chance of achieving this goal then we need to consider a portfolio of technologies in order to achieve this this means keeping ccs carbon capture and storage nuclear and biofuels for instance on the table
7719725 if we have some kind of major breakthrough in solar technologies and electricity storage technologies then we wont need to rely so heavily on these other technologies
7719726 i am not necessarily advocating a full scale implementation of any of these technologies but rather that we continue to research and develop a wide range of technologies and not flat out reject any possibilities
7719727 based on this analysis we can say that there is a 94 percent probability of imminent global cooling and the beginning of the coming ice age
7719728 most of these major natural processes that we are witnessing now are interdependent and occur at the end of each interglacial period ultimately causing sudden long term cooling
7719729 carbon dioxide is not to blame for global climate change sorokhtin said
7719730 solar activity is many times more powerful than the energy produced by the whole of humankind mans influence on nature is a drop in the ocean
7719731 if we are facing a crisis at all i think it is that we are preparing for warming when it is looking like we are cooling we are preparing for the wrong thing
7719732 there is no evidence that carbon dioxide has ever driven or will ever drive world temperatures and climate change worrying about carbon dioxide is irrelevant
7719733 russias adventure in georgia has been described as a warlet a contained firing spree that wound up and down within a week but to europes energy markets it was the equivalent of wide scale carpet bombing
7719734 before the georgian crisis europe seemed to be doing all the right things with little georgia at the centre of a sensible energy diversification plan a column of russian tanks wrecked that strategy in an instant a new energy war is about to begin
7719735 the speed at which the climate is changing has been significantly underestimated with thousands of australian homes potentially at risk from rising sea levels a conference has heard ports harbours and airports situated near the ocean are also vulnerable to the immediate effects of climate change said keynote speaker jo mummery preliminary modelling has found that if there is a rise in sea levels 269 505 houses could be at risk in nsw and 2 875 houses in the nt
7719736 dr jo mummery from the department of climate change told the delegation that if sea levels rose just one metre exclusive pockets of the gold coast would be completely washed out she says if water enters a 200 metre buffer zone almost 559 000 residential buildings would be affected across the country
7719737 the head of the climate change unit at the australian national university and science adviser to the federal government professor will steffen says he believes the scientific community is underestimating the speed at which the climate is changing
7719738 the evidence over the past 12 to 18 months suggests that we have underestimated how fast this aspect of the earths system can change
7719739 ive already told you once you cant hand out those balloons its an offence
7719740 the improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge authority as such for him scepticism is the highest of duties blind faith the one unpardonable sin
7719741 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
7719742 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it
7719743 this crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion a planned economy which adjusts production to the needs of the community would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man woman and child
7719744 the object in life is not to be on the side of the majority but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane
7719745 the modern literature on hate crimes began with a remarkable 1933 book by arthur raper titled the tragedy of lynching raper assembled data on the number of lynchings each year in the south and on the price of an acres yield of cotton he calculated the correla tion coefficient between the two series at 0 532 in other words when the economy was doing well the number of lynchings was lower in 2001 donald green laurence mcfalls and jennifer smith published a paper that demolished the alleged connection between economic condi tions and lynchings in rapers data raper had the misfortune of stopping his anal ysis in 1929 after the great depression hit the price of cotton plummeted and economic condi tions deteriorated yet lynchings continued to fall the correlation disappeared altogether when more years of data were added

7719753 it seems then that tommys mother and his aunts and all his spiritual pastors and masters have for years approached tommy upon a strictly deterministic basis they have thought it worth while to talk and to talk a great deal they have done what all pedagogues do they have adjusted means to ends and have looked for results taking no account of freedom at all
7719754 god inasmuch as he is good cannot be the cause of all things on the contrary he is the author of only a small part of human affairs of the larger part he is not the author for our evil things far outnumber our good things and the good things we must ascribe to no other than god while we must seek elsewhere and not in him the causes of the evil things
7719755 st pauls system of morality avoids many pitfalls of manmade systems of ethics but it does not eliminate one of the great problems involved in all morality and religion
7719756 throughout the whole history of philosophy and theology people have wrangled over the question of free will
7719757 we have seen that the possibility of moral or immoral action depends upon the power of choice
7719758 theological determinism or predestination is a cardinal doctrine of mohammedanism
7719759 some still hold that when the typhoid victim dies from lack of proper sanitation it happened because it was to be
7719760 here i stand so help me god i can do no other
7719761 if i am foreordained to be saved or damned there is not much use of my doing anything about my fate
7719762 we are responsible for our feelings because they are right or wrong in their own nature
7719763 whenever reason and the power of self determination or spontaneity are combined in an agent he is free and responsible for his outward acts and for his volitions
7719764 in the first place they inquire by what right the lord is angry with his creatures who had not provoked him by any previous offence for that to devote to destruction whom he pleases is more like the caprice of a tyrant than the lawful sentence of a judge that men have reason therefore to expostulate with god if they are predestinated to eternal death without any demerit of their own merely by his sovereign will
7719765 hey let me build my base and see how well you do against my pretty defenses
7719766 we dont want to be instrumental in overthrowing any government we dont have any such intentions
7719767 this organization is a terrorist organization and created mayhem against public life
7719768 i think at the moment they definitely have the upper hand and we need to do something better
7719769 we are neither registered nor do we have any bank accounts
7719770 we have banned tehreek e taliban pakistan because of their involvement in a series of suicide attacks
7719771 the anp is committing genocide of pashtuns and killing innocent women and children
7719772 we need to have foreign reserves and it is not the job of the central bank to go around borrowing money
7719773 the economic fundamentals are stuck against us if the rupee closes at 77 we will see 80 very soon
7719774 i bestow honor on whom i wish and dishonor on whom i wish saving pakistan the entity we call pakistan and which is dearer to us than life itself can only be saved by three means one a revolution led by men with depth vision and a native but coherent ideology and with the people behind them our genes have shown no such propensity the second is to submit to america entirely forget kashmir recognize israel give up all nuclear assets and downsize your armed forces to a token level then see how the mare goes but first decide whether there is self esteem in this the third and preferred path to salvation lies in wisdom wisdom demands that regardless of numbers our rulers should put aside their differences and get together to form a national government in which every region province ethnicity language and sect is represented to work together to take the country out of the perfect storm it is engulfed in sadly wisdom is also something that has passed us by entirely more even than our propensity to revolution the greeks said those whom the gods would destroy they first make mad our people are not mad they are desperate they are desperate because the choices before them are all anchored in past military regimes their leaders and their continuation born of military patronage if they had a fresh new choice anchored in the people without doubt they would decide sensibly there is vacuum for a new political force to emerge and fill a force that is anchored in a native ideology and rooted in the land and its people let there be a community from among you that invites to all that is good and enjoins the doing of what is known by common sense and sound minds to be right and forbids the doing of what is known by common sense and sound minds to be wrong and it is they who attain to success
7719775 and incline not toward those who do wrong lest the fire should touch you and you have no protectors other than allah nor you would then be helped
7719776 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
7719777 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7719778 and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
7719779 i have come here tonight to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7719780 as i look ahead i am strengthened by family and friendship
7719781 so many of you have been with me in the happiest days and the hardest days
7719782 together we have known success and seen failure victory and defeat
7719783 for me this is a season of hope new hope and this is the cause of my life new hope that we will break the old gridlock
7719784 has been a senator for all who believe that the dream has never died
7719785 two men who have changed my life and the life of this country
7719786 but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most this is one of those moments
7719787 when he is president he will have no stronger partner in the united states senate
7719788 one of his most famous songs i know youre very familiar with gasolina
7719789 every wearied body must late or soon return to dust
7719790 christians muslims and jews are in some ways the most dangerous people on the planet and probably christians being the most dangerous because their fingers are closer to the most nuclear weapons
7719791 if muslims christians and jews can find points of contact maybe it will help us avoid pressing these buttons
7719792 what did we know in church history that weve forgotten
7719793 the church as its existed as its developed in modernity is going to have to do some rethinking and retooling to remain faithful during these changes
7719794 wow thats a lot of people for a first b day party
7719795 shes wearing what muslims are supposed to wear and shes performing well
7719796 organized for the benefit of the community or the social welfare of the community
7719797 cindy mccain is on her way to the country of georgia to assess the civilian casualties
7719798 the segregation of rural domestic load and agricultural load will not only ensure better energy audit but accurate calculation of power subsidy as well
7719799 about 384 feeders have been commissioned after segregation of the load and the entire work is likely to be over by the end of october once the load is transferred to separate feeders the reliability and quality of power supply will increase to the agricultural and domestic consumers this will result in better load management for the state government as well as reduction of technical losses on account of load separation the collection efficiency is also expected to increase alongwith alleviating the load off the overloaded feeders
7719800 hes got to kick butt a little more about it
7719801 we spent an enormous amount of money and time and a full time unit of people looking under every stone it wasnt like we did not know anything about her
7719802 and we thought her position on this was pretty reasonable
7719803 we must understand that technologies like these are the way of the future
7719804 we must understand that technologies like these are the way of the future
7719805 we must understand that technologies gt like these are the way of the future
7719806 we must understand that technologies like these are the way of the future
7719807 we must understand that technologies gt gt like these are the way of the future
7719808 we must understand that technologies gt like these are the way of the future
7719809 we must understand that technologies like these are the way of the future
7719810 this parameter also reflects as to how effective is the interconnection between two networks
7719811 in a number of areas the degree of congestion between the operators is alarming in a number of cities the level of congestion between the networks of different operators is far more than the benchmark
7719812 its not a miracle but a natural result of our efforts its just a milestone along the way

7719816 i dont dismiss the possibility that it could be higher but thats the very likely scenario
7719817 donors recognize that this is a good year for democrats and this financial advantage will be used to solidify their position
7719818 the fact that the republican party will not be able to bury the democrats in money this time will make a difference
7719819 its kind of like a giant chess game doing well in certain states gives you the opportunity to move into other ones
7719820 a catastrophic mistake that has cost thousands of lives and over a trillion dollars
7719821 has weakened our standing in the world and our capability to protect the american people
7719822 but our journey to take our nation in a new direction cannot be complete without new leadership in the white house
7719823 democrats know we cant afford any more of the same failed republican path
7719824 republicans say john mccain has experience we say john mccain has the experience of being wrong
7719825 our party and our country are strengthened by her candidacy
7719826 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
7719827 ayers is clearly a relevant issue as it relates to obamas pattern of relationships
7719828 its hard to see how one actually could resolve having any sort of relationship with an admitted remorseless domestic terrorist
7719829 be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
7719830 the last time obama saw ayers was about a year ago when he crossed paths with him while biking in the neighborhood
7719831 the suggestion that ayers was a political adviser to obama or someone who shaped his political views is patently false
7719832 the notion that me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when i was 8 years old somehow reflects on me and my values doesnt make much sense
7719833 it was a difficult time but those days are long over
7719834 an attempt to demonize bill as a way of damaging barack obama
7719835 i dont regret setting bombs i feel we didnt do enough
7719836 i said i had a thousand regrets but no regrets for opposing the war with every ounce of my strength
7719837 i have met and like john mccain but he bombed and presumably killed many people in a war i opposed
7719838 if i can set all that aside i would hope that americans will accept
7719839 he was playing a video game sitting on a couch playing a game when a gun was put to his temple at point blank range and it was over
7719840 were trying to deal with this issue but its going to take the whole community ministers advocates the city as well as many of the counseling agencies who we are partnering with now in this project
7719841 weve got to be more involved we have to be its not an option any more
7719842 my mind feared getting used to this treachery this has to stop this unwarranted undeserved death must end please god let not another fall
7719843 im getting a reasonable amount of work with ends and linebackers they said i might be going out there a little bit as a backup to learn the position its going pretty good im learning from joey and the coaches
7719844 wir diskutieren derzeit die frage dass alle bestehenden kernkraftwerke abgeschaltet werden sollen
7719845 da brauchen wir keine sondersteuer sondern es w re gar nicht schlecht wenn die kernkraftwerke berhaupt mal steuerpflichtig w ren
7719846 dann w rde es etwa bedeuten dass das letzte atomkraftwerk in deutschland bis 2049 laufen w rde
7719847 und dann kann man ungef hr rechnen dass das ein reingewinn von 250 milliarden bedeutet
7719848 dann frage ich mich warum wird dann nicht jetzt schon dieser nettogewinn zur ckgegeben
7719849 wir hatten vor etlichen jahren prognosen ber ganz stabile energiepreise in den n chsten jahrzehnten ich mahne nur an all diese prognosen bis 2020 oder 2021 bleiben alle preise stabil sind doch albern die kann doch in der heutigen welt kein mensch mehr halten
7719850 sometimes dealing with the clintons is like dealing with brett favre
7719851 theyre very good players and theyve got a great record but sometimes youre not sure what they really want
7719852 taking it a little harder because he wanted his wife to succeed and also because he wants a good clinton legacy
7719853 ive probably done more for sen obama than anybody in my position has ever done by this time
7719854 i cant imagine he will continue to bum rap barack obama which is what hes been doing up until now unfortunately
7719855 we would love to see her in the white house
7719856 when someone tries to ram a vote by acclamation you can walk out of the convention
7719857 if you stay in that hall you can stand up and say we will not be silenced
7719858 we have a moral obligation to count the votes of the woman who achieved what no other woman in american politics has done and who in fact got 18 million votes
7719859 i will vote for obama but i will not vote for obama on the first ballot
7719860 lyndon johnson became president of the united states and bobby kennedy did not did that mean the end of kennedy politics in this country
7719861 the de facto legislative leader of the democratic party and the voice of the party on the hill
7719862 her range of options is probably more if barack obama wins i dont think john mccain will consider her for a cabinet position or the supreme court but barack obama may well
7719863 if she wants another shot at the white house obviously it makes it easier if obama doesnt win
7719864 but that doesnt help her with the democratic party if she doesnt actively help him
7719865 what exactly about the clinton era of the 90s dont you want to go back to
7719866 one of the most prosperous economies in the countrys history and international relations where bill clinton was one of the most popular figures in the world
7719867 we know she was first lady and ran for president
7719868 in the name of the hard working americans who make up our forgotten middle class i proudly accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
7719869 my fellow americans after these four good hard years i still believe in a place called hope a place called america
7719870 now my hair is a little grayer my wrinkles are a little deeper but with the same optimism and hope i brought to the work i loved so eight years ago i want you to know my heart is filled with gratitude
7719871 my friends after three conventions as a candidate or a president tonight i come to you as a citizen returning to the role that i have played for most of my life
7719872 some of us women in politics are going to take hard knocks
7719873 to raise a happy healthy and hopeful child it takes a family it takes teachers it takes clergy it takes business people it takes community leaders it takes those who protect our health and safety it takes all of us yes it takes a village and it takes a president
7719874 bill and i are closing one chapter of our lives and soon well be starting a new one for me it will be up to the people of new york to decide whether ill have the privilege of serving them in the united states senate
7719875 i think i know a great leader when i see one and so does america in 1992 and 1996 americans chose a president who left our country in better shape than when he took office
7719876 indias stock market takes off tata consultancy services leads the way
7719877 a small part came loose when i used the bands to tie my hair up one morning it looked strange to me because of its different color not the yellow color we normally see in plastic bands i peeled deeper and found something that looked like a condom
7719878 he was just shivering in pain and couldnt walk very well
7719879 id say the third degree burn is probably over 20 percent maybe 25 percent of his body
7719880 you get close to him and you can smell the burning of him and the rest of his fur was singed
7719881 hes always going to have large areas of scarred skin
7719882 michael phelps eeeeeewwwww no i have better taste than that
7719883 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7719884 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america
7719885 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama to the presidency of the united states
7719886 together we have known success and seen setbacks but we have never lost our belief that we are all called to a better country and a newer world
7719887 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the senate
7719888 nothing nothing is gonna keep me away form this special gathering tonight
7719889 we are told that barack obama believes too much in an america of high principle and bold endeavors
7719890 our people answered his call and rose to the challenge and today an american flag still marks the surface of the moon
7719891 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and for me our country will be committed to his cause the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7719892 but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7719893 se est presionando a presidentes de juntas de acci n comunal y a funcionarios para que le hagan campa a porque de lo contrario no habr recursos para obras
7719894 aqu no le preguntan a uno qu estudi o qu propuesta de gobierno tiene sino cu ntos millones tiene en el bolsillo
7719895 los dos candidatos pacheco y gasca han tenido procesos judiciales y si bien no est n inhabilitados su moral sigue siendo cuestionada si salen de una curul porque est contaminada y llegan m s microbios a esta pues la enfermedad contin a
7719896 acusaciones temerarias sin fundamento nunca probadas ni denunciadas ante la justicia en lo que tiene que ver con mi actuaci n o la de mis ministros
7719897 uribe debe dedicarse a colaborar con la fiscal a por las manipulaciones que desde palacio se han montado contra la corte suprema en connivencia con los paramilitares
7719898 la compostura y el equilibrio que le eviten al pa s una investigaci n formal practicada por la corte penal internacional a nuestras autoridades por las obstrucciones a las acciones de nuestra justicia por delitos de lesa humanidad
7719899 he was playing a video game sitting on a couch playing a game when a gun was put to his temple at point blank range and it was over
7719900 were trying to deal with this issue but its going to take the whole community ministers advocates the city as well as many of the counseling agencies who we are partnering with now in this project
7719901 weve got to be more involved we have to be its not an option any more
7719902 my mind feared getting used to this treachery this has to stop this unwarranted undeserved death must end please god let not another fall
7719903 un montaje de un sector del gobierno que est aliado con los jefes paramilitares
7719904 en referencia a una visita realizada por ese funcionario a yopal donde departi con una testigo en un sitio p blico
7719905 toda persona que quiera dar una informaci n seria sobre manipulaci n de testigos aqu la recibimos colombia tiene que recuperar el imperio estatal de justicia
7719906 nosotros no tenemos inter s de enlodar a los magistrados tenemos inter s en que la pol tica contra el crimen sea una pol tica imparcial y sin manipulaci n de testigos
7719907 no qued claro es un fallo pol tico con el cual se quiso quedar bien con la corte y con el presidente
7719908 gobiernos del oficialismo liberal que para combatir a unos criminales se aliaron con otros criminales como en el caso de la alianza con los pepes
7719909 la corte entra en una solidaridad de cuerpo a bloquear la posibilidad de que se investigue a cualquiera de estos funcionarios
7719910 a m lo que me preocupa es que pasa desapercibido que alg n investigador de la corte haga tr fico con testigos o se emborrache con ellos
7719911 un gobierno liberal se atreve a decir que este gobierno no tiene autoridad moral se ali con los pepes para perseguir a escobar
7719912 yo he llamado muchas veces al fiscal fiscal acabo de recibir esta informaci n la he puesto en conocimiento de l muchas veces y que no me vaya a desmentir
7719913 me dijo que ten a que darme una informaci n muy delicada sobre criminalidad en urab le dije voy a estar tal d a en medell n y le dije hable con mi general
7719914 en el mundo moderno ning n gobierno es capaz de controlar la violencia solo
7719915 la parapol tica es un tema central para nosotros porque los m ximos responsables son los que deben ser juzgados y condenados
7719916 but the even greater sin was to borrow biographical facts from kinnock that although true about kinnock didnt apply to biden unlike kinnock biden wasnt the first person in his family history to attend college as he asserted nor were his ancestors coal miners as he claimed when he used kinnocks words
7719917 gracefulness is to the body what understanding is to the mind
7719918 its really interesting to capture some of the energy of the dnc and its an opportunity to work with the city of denver
7719919 weve been at this a long time mixing music and entertainment with a message of environmental sustainability and community sustainability
7719920 we started at a time when it wasnt in fashion at all
7719921 the down side is that its pretty easy to become complacent and think im recycling im cool
7719922 i got to see him use music to effect social change and do environmental work protecting the hudson river
7719923 i sometimes say we were sort of like mickey rooney and judy garland in those old movies where its sort of like hey lets do a show and save the school
7719924 were like lets do a show and help the planet
7719925 theres something very romantic and immediate about live radio on front of an audience and i think that as a performance vehicle it is really exciting because it creates just an extra element of danger
7719926 youre playing in front of a crowd but its also being heard nationwide its a big deal
7719927 far out ive never heard that when it was written it was completely different its the first time we kept building a song until we got to a point where we really wanted it putting all that time and effort into it was challenging but rewarding i also like the idea of making you wait for the chorus
7719928 its first time ive put myself as a fictional character its like fight club where edward norton plays the straight man and brad pitt plays the guy hed like to be im getting away with things without having actually doing them
7719929 i really wanted to experiment with a horn section and make it uplifting without being cheesy thats a hard thing to do but i think ive accomplished it

7719945 its not the first time ive had some dealings with the town
7719946 the key elements that are different in this situation is that home occupations are not supposed to display their stock and trade
7719947 what it is that they are making and selling should not be on display they also have to keep any of the actual activities within the home itself
7719948 you cannot come to my house and buy it and please dont

7719955 a lot of procedures a lot of just giving them expectations
7719956 this really is a choice between words and deeds rhetoric and a record of accomplishment
7719957 with obama it basically is rhetoric theres a very skinny record
7719958 you wont have to look too hard to find us in the twin cities
7719959 the republicans can set up as many war rooms as sen mccain has houses but that wont change the fact that john mccain voted with george bush 95 of the time last year and offers just more of the same failed economic policies
7719960 were just going to keep throwing their old quotes back at them
7719961 its a real opportunity for us to reach out to democrats who think obamas not ready
7719962 youve got more of the concerns weve seen about credit and the financials lehmans down because of the speculation that the bid is not happening and theres a negative report on aig
7719963 we received credible information that drug cartels in mexico have given permission to hit targets on the u s side of the border
7719964 cbp is on heightened alert ever since we became aware of the threats in mexico
7719965 the number of cases referred from law enforcement in years past was much smaller
7719966 alleged violations of the laws of war by the milf in its recent attacks particularly in lanao del norte should be dealt with accordingly under its own processes
7719967 we support calls for an interfaith fact finding and mercy mission in conflict areas to show our solidarity and pastoral concern for the displaced
7719968 the peace negotiations cease to be authentic when it is used to extend the administrations term of office or if it exploits the current situation to push us closer to emergency rule as women religious we say no to these maneuverings and selfish designs
7719969 from our eyes of faith they are gods anawim belonging to the same family as the poor among christians and lumads in mindanao
7719970 anguish women and children who will be most vulnerable and traumatized in situations of all out offensives not to mention its lasting adverse effects on the environment
7719971 we grieve for the many lives lost in the still ongoing armed conflict in many of our mission areas we are currently accompanying thousands of internally displaced people as they struggle to secure themselves and their families in cramped classrooms public facilities and shared homes of relatives
7719972 we express concern that if the current all out war offensives of the government which comprises of air strikes indiscriminate shelling and militarization of communities will continue without let up we will be faced with a humanitarian crisis of massive proportions
7719973 releasing prisoners can be difficult especially when you talk about individuals who have been involved in the murder of innocent civilians the idea for this release was to strengthen moderate and pragmatic palestinians
7719974 there will be no peace unless all prisoners are released
7719975 it looks like one guy just made a remark trying to act important one federal official told nbc news

7719985 alright diggers those who didnt see an assasination plot for obama happening by white supremacists please raise your hand
7719986 oh wow obama is amazing hes gonna get jobs for everyone hes gonna do this hes gonna do that
7719987 those who would sacrifice essential liberties for a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
7719988 i believe a good example of this is massive citizen surveilance itll give you a little temporary safety for as long as it takes the criminals to notice the surveilance cams shortly thereafter criminals simply find ways around the surveilance cameras and now criminals are still criminals but honest citizens no longer have any privacy the same could be said for gun control outlawing guns will only give you some temporary safety as long it takes for the criminals to get guns illegally so now criminals still have guns but you as a citizen have lost a very essential liberty and have also lost a massive amount of safety in losing the ability to protect yourself with weapons to match those of the criminals
7719989 we do not not wish death upon those we disagree with
7719990 no way they will let a black man be president
7719991 cbs4 investigator brian maass reported one of the suspects told authorities they were going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a

7719998 it looks like one guy just made a remark trying to act important
7719999 were trying to figure out what these guys had in mind
