4590175 the father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him
4590176 better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king who will no more be admonished god would prefer us to remain poor than to become rich and foolish
4590177 for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed

4590184 and windows vista had driven client revenue to an average growth rate of 16 percent since it became generally available
4590185 the biggest problem vista has today is in perception a perceived lack of value and perceived instability
4590186 its hard to come up with gee whiz features for a relatively mature product but security and improved manageability and ease of deployment especially from the standpoint of ecosystem support will certainly help improve microsofts chances
4590187 to enable standard users to be able to install known good apps and prevent administrators from running known bad apps
4590188 because this type of attack requires the browser to interact with the already local activex plug in there are basically two ways to eliminate these kinds of issues one fix the vulnerable plug in or two tell the browser to stop talking to it the kill bit does the latter
4590189 microsoft seems to be stepping up to the plate by issuing kill bits for third party applications largely because ie is involved
4590190 after some investigations we found out that symantec especially included image uploader to the threat list in one of their updates
4590191 and perhaps unlike kill bit norton affects the new secure version
4590192 microsoft repeatedly and emphatically said that they are working to better secure the and everything which runs on it
4590193 then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted forty days and forty nights he was afterward an hungred and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son of god command that these stones be made bread but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple and saith unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone jesus said unto him it is written again thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and saith unto him all these things will i give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me then saith jesus unto him get thee hence satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve then the devil leaveth him and behold angels came and ministered unto him
4590194 man cannot live by the earthly food alone or by itself but it has to have every word of god
4590195 i will not stop until i am glorified totally through the earth
4590196 at the same time came the disciples unto jesus saying who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them and said
4590197 oh were all children of god and this scripture means that you must remain a child
4590198 oh as long as you accept jesus in your heart thats all you have to do to be saved
4590199 by faith moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the kings commandment by faith moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of pharaohs daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward by faith he forsook egypt not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible through faith he kept the passover and the sprinkling of blood lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them
4590200 foolishness is bound in the heart of a child but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him
4590201 apply thine heart unto instruction and thine ears to the words of knowledge withhold not correction from the child for if thou beatest him with the rod he shall not die thou shalt beat him with the rod and shalt deliver his soul from hell my son if thine heart be wise my heart shall rejoice even mine yea my reins shall rejoice when thy lips speak right things
4590202 the father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him
4590203 better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king who will no more be admonished god would prefer us to remain poor than to become rich and foolish
4590204 for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed
4590205 and he spake many things unto them in parables saying
4590206 but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that ye may be the children
4590207 and behold one came and said unto him good master what good thing shall i do that i may have eternal life and he said unto him
4590208 i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me
4590209 so when they had dined jesus saith to simon peter
4590210 and upon this came his disciples and marvelled that he talked with the woman yet no man said what seekest thou
4590211 and the devil said unto him if thou be the son of god command this stone that it be made bread and jesus answered him saying
4590212 and he was there with the lord forty days and forty nights he did neither eat bread nor drink water and he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant the ten commandments
4590213 and this i pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment that ye may approve things that are excellent that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of christ being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by jesus christ unto the glory and praise of god
4590214 now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils having their conscience seared with a hot iron forbidding to marry and commanding to abstain from meats which god hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth
4590215 we are bound to thank god always for you brethren as it is meet because that your faith groweth exceedingly and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of god for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of god that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of god for which ye also suffer seeing it is a righteous thing with god to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you and to you who are troubled rest with us when the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his power when he shall come to be glorified in his saints and to be admired in all them that believe because our testimony among you was believed in that day
4590216 for the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of god and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of god

4590218 we had previously demonstrated that grp stimulates the growth of this particular cancer
4590219 this time we wanted to demonstrate the opposite effects by targeting grp receptors in neuroblastoma to see if we could make the cancer regress
4590220 in order for cells in a soft agar colony to proliferate and grow without adhering to a surface they have to possess malignant properties as in the original neuroblastoma cells
4590221 however our grp receptor silenced neuroblastoma cells behaved like nonmalignant cells their growth was significantly inhibited and they formed fewer new colonies
4590222 we wanted to see how these neuroblastoma cells would behave whether they would grow and or metastasize to the liver
4590223 the cancer cells that expressed the grp receptors behaved as we expected with rapid growth as well as aggressive liver metastases the implication is that the metastatic behavior of this cancer is driven by grp and its receptor
4590224 with the publication of our data we would like to propose an application involving a number of institutions to move forward with a phase 1 clinical trial using this fda approved grp receptor antagonist for neuroblastoma
4590225 we hope to demonstrate the safety of targeting grp receptors for effective inhibition of neuroblastoma growth and metastasis this is just such a tragic disease and with all the advances were making we ought to be able to make a dent in it

4590254 there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him
4590255 of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing ye are dull of hearing for when for the time ye ought to be teachers ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil

4590322 the trial judges reasons are so deficient that they foreclose meaningful appellate review
4590323 t he appellate court is not given the power to intervene simply because it thinks the trial court did a poor job of expressing itself
4590324 reasons for judgment are the primary mechanism by which judges account to the parties and to the public for the decisions they render
4590325 interested members of the public can satisfy themselves that justice has been done or not as the case may be
4590326 trial courts where the essential findings of facts and drawing of inferences are done can only be held properly to account if the reasons for their adjudication are transparent and accessible to the public and to the appellate courts

4590364 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4590365 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality

4590374 the concerns about inflation have got to be coming down with oil prices down maybe 25 percent from the peak other commodity prices gosh gold down 20 percent silver down 10 percent today alone those at the helm so to speak have to be observant of whats happening in the commodities sector and thats been the biggest push in terms of inflation for the past six to 12 months
4590375 i think the third quarter will be fine based on some technical adjustments with inventory and continued strong trade but the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2009 do not look good it is all dependent upon housing prices
4590376 as the capital is raised it raises interest rates and it stretches risk premiums and it forces asset sales which perpetuates the cycle
4590377 we need a new balance sheet to provide new capital and funds for the housing markets and the financial sectors
4590378 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring
4590379 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry
4590380 inconsistencies and inadequacies which limit the interpretations of the findings
4590381 for this to come out on a friday afternoon just before california takes action it definitely raises some eyebrows
4590382 the demand has heightened to where its really been crazy here
4590383 typical summer would have been right around 150 to 200 stoves weve surpassed the 600 mark for stoves already this summer
4590384 whether they can afford it or not theyre not going to take it
4590385 theyre putting wood stoves in to keep their costs down theyll be darned if theyre going to give it to the oil people
4590386 the only thing weve taken out of here is two truckloads of firewood

4590388 mills are hurting calling us for logs and then homeowners are calling us for firewood for next winter i get two three calls a week and i just have to say im sorry we dont have any wood for you
4590389 the way demand is going to be its going to be expensive

4590396 i feel that we have made a lot of ground from the start of the season until now

4590426 the summer months tend to draw americans to more leisure pursuits and that was certainly the case in july

4590439 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4590440 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4590441 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4590442 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4590443 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4590444 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4590445 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4590446 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4590447 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4590448 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4590449 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4590450 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4590451 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4590452 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

4590459 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4590460 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4590461 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
4590462 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
4590463 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
4590464 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
4590465 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4590466 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4590467 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4590468 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4590469 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4590470 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4590471 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4590472 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4590473 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4590474 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4590475 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4590476 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4590477 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4590478 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4590479 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4590480 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4590481 it came on quickly and hung around for at least an hour or so
4590482 you dont realize how reliant you are on computer systems to get your daily job done
4590483 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4590484 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4590485 do you think these fellows would come this far and put their reputations and their jobs on the line if they didnt have what they say they have
4590486 extensive scientific studies will be done on the body by a team of scientists including a molecular biologist an anthropologist a paleontologist and other scientists over the next few months at an undisclosed location
4590487 then there was a loud crash and i woke up
4590488 i ran to my sons room shook him awake and called the fire brigade
4590489 i am only alive because of my cat i am so grateful to her
4590490 its not actually that unusual for pets to notice smoke first and alert their owners
4590491 that era to my understanding and certainly among my clients is over
4590492 they are coming after these guys for tons of money over record keeping violations
4590493 these are small employers they are not sophisticated people they are trying to start a business and create jobs for people
4590494 help i am the ugliest lamp ever when my old owner looked at me he turned to stone
4590495 gt wayland high school graduate michael murphy recently published a book based on his experiences growing up with learning disabilities wayland
4590496 the test was on antonyms and one of the words they gave me was thin i chose viscous as the right answer
4590497 the previous evening i guess id been reading something in the encyclopedia about the properties of oil which can range from very thin and watery to quite viscous so it was a natural if under the circumstances incorrect choice
4590498 one highly indicative though not definitive symptom is a significant gap between a higher verbal iq that is something that can be recited back verbally and a lower performance iq such as speed gross motor skills and spatial reasoning
4590499 nld from the inside out talking to parents teachers and teens about growing up with nonverbal learning disabilities
4590500 where i flunked every class except for logic and technically anyway spanish
4590501 the topic was entirely open ended and my mother suggested that i write about nld i did and got an a on the paper so then i started to think i might want to work on this for my senior thesis and it just kind of spiraled from there
4590502 i wanted to find out what nld was like for them and what they wanted to tell parents siblings teachers friends and psychologists i also wanted to measure the degree of severity of the symptoms over time and what i found out there was that while the younger people those in their teens and early 20s often felt helpless and hopeless older respondents were more optimistic so one of the messages of the book is that if youre an adolescent with nld dont give up it does get better
4590503 were public servants people cant forget that we serve the people the public has a right to know about the decisions that affect them
4590504 if the law is not clear i tend to be on the side of being more transparent
4590505 the only teeth is to sue and you really dont want to do that
4590506 you have to have the necessary information about the peoples background that you feel safe
4590507 if you have a history of larceny or embezzlement and you try to work for a bank they should be able to know
4590508 im very much for trying to find ways to reform cori and still keep people safe
4590509 people shouldnt be branded for life if they commit a certain type of offense on one hand we need people to know but on the other hand we cant take away a persons right to have a life
4590510 the cases come to us and we can prosecute them but what will keep them from coming back is treatment
4590511 theres not nearly enough programs available a lot of these cases would not make it to court if we had enough resources on the front end to treat the behaviors that lead them to us
4590512 personally im open to it and i know the people in public safety are for it
4590513 absolutely hes too old how many 72 year olds do you know who can work a 60 hour week
4590514 dads a happy go lucky guy whos enjoying himself thats what mccain should be doing
4590515 i see mccain showing his age i think one reason his wife stands in back of him all the time is to tell him what to say
4590516 i dont like the idea of his being 80 at the end of his second term
4590517 as people get up in age they get sick more often and mccain has had cancer
4590518 i know someone who was old at 40 she thought like an older person
4590519 my grandmas 93 and her cousin lived to be 105
4590520 now think of all that stuff john mccain went through in vietnam

4590523 every child can learn and every child can have the opportunity to learn and the opportunity to go to college
4590524 that is one student at a time one school at a time working with parents working with the community to make our community the best
4590525 were asking to look a little harder a little tighter and find a bit of money for a slight increase across the board all teachers and families are facing the same increase in costs across the board says clements
4590526 im willing to do whatever to make each student successful whether or not i feel i have the funding i need or no
4590527 hi friend lets play blog tagging i tagged you in my post please check and please do the same
4590528 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
4590529 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4590530 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4590531 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4590532 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4590533 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4590534 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4590535 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4590536 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4590537 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4590538 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4590539 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4590540 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4590541 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4590542 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4590543 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4590544 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4590545 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4590546 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4590547 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4590548 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4590549 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4590550 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4590551 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
4590552 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
4590553 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4590554 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4590555 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4590556 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4590557 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4590558 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4590559 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4590560 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4590561 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4590562 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4590563 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4590564 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4590565 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4590566 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4590567 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4590568 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4590569 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

4590581 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring
4590582 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry

4590645 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4590646 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics

4590685 as we move out of the summer months gold could recoup and move above 900 again but its going to be difficult
4590686 this is a very steep discount and now is probably a safe time to get in at a lower price than just a couple of weeks ago

4590698 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
4590699 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos

4590701 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e

4590713 nuestros peque os productores agr colas son masacrados por la brutal injusticia del entorno del comercio internacional
4590714 en la globalizaci n el campesino o campesina pierde su identidad social cultural y econ mica de productor ahora un campesino es consumidor de semillas y qu micos caros que venden las poderosas corporaciones trasnacionales por medio de poderosos latifundistas y prestamistas locales
4590715 a menudo lo han hecho en unos t rminos muy desfavorables para los granjeros pobres dejando a estos con m s inseguridad alimentaria y a los gobiernos a depender de unas ayudas internacionales poco predecibles
4590716 muchas de las empresas privadas que vinieron a reemplazar a los investigadores estatales resultaron ser monopolistas en busca de dinero
4590717 no pensamos que el coste humano de esos programas seria tan grande y que las ganancias econ micas tardasen tanto en llegar

4590722 i go home and give him a big hug and it ends up being a head lock

4590726 this is the fastest temperature change in the instrumental record and it puts us back to where we were in 1930
4590727 lets not center the environmental movement around global warming if we do then every time the thermometer drops well have people thinking that the environment doesnt matter anymore
4590728 a few problems with this article first phil chapman did not present at nor even participated in the conference described in the article
4590729 the world cooled quickly between january last year and january this year by about 0 7c

4590731 theres a reason why cancer rates have been spiking over the last couple of decades were now living in our own filth
4590732 i just think its funny that gore who is so worried about gw lives in a house that expends more energy than 20 times the national norm is he really that worried

4590739 one guy was postponing his wedding till he got one he has a motorcycle club called the patas negras
4590740 we had a customer who went and visited his ham in the mountain village where it was being cured
4590741 they grow up as a gang together for two years then when its time for them to meet their maker they play them mozart after mozart they go to bed for the night i dont know if theyre tucked in the next morning they get hot showers then some mysterious carbon dioxide enters their atmosphere and they go off to piggy heaven
4590742 if theyre scared they produce epinephrine if theyre not stressed the meat is fine im not saying the ham people are pig lovers theyre meat lovers
4590743 jamon iberico is the finest ham in the world it is a ham that will ruin you for other hams
4590744 even the fat which of course my wife assiduously cuts off and i love and i eat when shes not looking ive been told the acorns give the ham and the fat this rich flavor its spectacular nobody believes me its as good as i say
4590745 i immediately e mailed back we were going right past la alberca so we visited the ham we had to go through a bath for our shoes and put on white robes and shower caps we got great pictures me petting a ham then petting a pig
4590746 my brother and sisters and a few other crazies like me have bought 1 pound chunks of it which ill cut for them
4590747 youd have the ham on the kitchen table and people would float by during the day neighbors friends extended family and cut off thin slices the ham would last a month or so in the us were not communal types people dont float through our kitchens so most people will probably have a big party
4590748 the sevillana which is like flamenco but for ordinary people
4590749 you wont have to mortgage your house to get the ham though going to a red sox game can cost as much as bellota
4590750 oh my god this is awesome this is better than sex

4590752 this is a rare chance for recreational athletes to run in the same race as olympic level athletes
4590753 its also a beautiful seaside run and theres a lot of energy around because people from all different walks of life participate its truly a race for everyone
4590754 we plan our cape vacation around the falmouth road race every summer
4590755 i have a racing strategy which is start slow and then ease off
4590756 for my family its really just a casual fun time and many members of our extended family run it too
4590757 i first got into running when i was on air force active duty in vietnam and officers had to run 1 5 miles in 10 minutes
4590758 and my father n law who is now 96 was also a runner
4590759 that runners high has carried me through many a day and helped me better deal with cranky people around me
4590760 this is the second summer we did the race together
4590761 ive been a runner off and on throughout my life so i decided to train for falmouth as a way to stay motivated
4590762 we started running together when molly was younger and now shes much faster than i am
4590763 for the past few summers weve vacationed in mashpee so this is an opportune event for us to do together
4590764 one big treat is that ive done falmouth with two out of three sons in law and all three of my daughters but never my wife who herself does triathalons
4590765 this is a tremendous boon for all of colorado not just brighton
4590766 gt a community group gathers in one of the meeting rooms at traditions of wayland wayland

4590768 there was a formal sterling tea service and quite a few stuffed heads on the walls i do believe there were also serpentine snakes around the lights in the dining room the familys chauffeurs would park our cars and when we came out the vehicles were all turned around and ready to go
4590769 if anyone wants to talk about barry in the future they must talk with the owner rick parry or the chief executive of aston villa
4590770 i will try to be very clear over the situation everyone has been talking and it seems that the blame is put on me
4590771 i get blamed for everything for global warming to high petrol prices
4590772 but in this case i want to be very clear since i talked to martin oneill about the situation in april i have not talked to anyone at aston villa
4590773 all the talks have been between our chief executive rick parry the owner and the chief executive of aston villa and those talks have all been pretty good
4590774 so if anyone wants to talk about barry in the future they must talk with the owner rick parry or the chief executive of aston villa and as i have said those talks i understand have been good
4590775 it is time for the felony voting requirement to be brought into the 21st century
4590776 hello boys and girls today is a wonderful day and we are going to learn a wonderful new word
4590777 we will respond to the governors lawsuit and you know well discuss this in court
4590778 obviously the governor needs to be better focused and start to work with the legislature to resolve this budget impasse
4590779 his efforts with this executive order is focused incorrectly on the public servants of california
4590780 those who have their first drink prior to age 19 are significantly more likely to become alcohol dependent to drive after drinking and to sustain injuries that require medical attention than those who did not drink before age 19
4590781 why take a substitute for happiness instead of actually feeling it
4590782 this new research is tremendously exciting as firstly the biological brain controls its own moving robot body and secondly it will enable us to investigate how the brain learns and memorises its experiences this research will move our understanding forward of how brains work and could have a profound effect on many areas of science and medicine
4590783 the dna is released out of the cell in less than a second
4590784 we dont know how eosinophils are capable of catapulting mitochondrial dna so quickly
4590785 we are making progress but we still are not able to keep up the pressure for the whole game
4590786 the victim at first thought hed been grazed in the leg but i guess the bullet was a little deeper into his leg than he thought
4590787 being a small community like lima you have all these shootings youre going to have people leave
4590788 im asking that we all work together we need to let the politics go
4590789 weve got to work together from the sheriffs department to the police department and the mayor and administration weve got to work together
4590790 america at the crossroads democracy power and the neoconservative legacy
4590791 tratamos de producir obras de denuncia claras y provocadoras que hagan reaccionar a la prensa y suscitar esfuerzos de destruccion de la obra por parte de aquellos que no puedan soportarla haciendo mucho ruido y volviendo accesible el mensaje a los que no pertenecen al campo
4590792 hice abundante cosecha de esqueletos y craneos en los cementerios de los indigenas sometidos que vivian en las inmediaciones del azul y en blanca grande
4590793 a ver el lugar de reposo de mat as catrileo el fue mi hermano mi amigo que me acompa en los d as de prisi n fui a rendirle homenaje
4590794 porque yo no ten a factura para comprobar que los 180 000 que se robaron eran m os
4590795 yo siento mucho sufrimiento estos a os que el hijo est preso son un dolor muy grande la comida no la puedo aprovechar la como entre l grimas a ra z de este problema de los que llevan la justicia me he enfermado tuvieron que llevarme al hospital espero que dejen en libertad a mi hijo y me lo entreguen en buenas condiciones como estaba l al ser detenido

4590797 you see it was the only workers i could get
4590798 the gentleman did not want us to call the cops he said that he had flipped his truck three or four times
4590799 theres a chance we would have missed him and hed still be out
4590800 some of our neighbors got calls from sheriffs deputies to lock their doors but we didnt get a call like that
4590801 three nights in august strategy heartbreak and joy inside the mind of a manager
4590802 a lot of them will go to great lengths to avoid us
4590803 there are a lot of insect eating bats around here
4590804 itd be a great opportunity for them to do so
4590805 theres an impression thats pretty much engraved on the brains of the students at wayland high school
4590806 and that is that youre not going to go to college unless you either excel at a sport or are on the honor roll there are a lot of students who dont quite fit that mold and its wonderful to have a place the waycam studio where you feel at home during the school day
4590807 ive always been kind of a nerd and i was having a lot of trouble at school before i got involved with waycam i was getting pretty bad grades also as someone id like to describe as a festively plump young man im not exactly going to excel on the track or basketball team
4590808 i started doing a lot better in school i was motivated and happy and found a place where i belonged
4590809 i think when you find something you like to do its not work
4590810 but at the same time he nudged me to do a little better gave me some drive and ambition and he taught me everything i know so far from the technical perspective
4590811 hes so supportive of anything the kids want to do
4590812 when i went to him with the idea for my program he encouraged me all the way
4590813 id love to have a career like hers where i could be taken seriously as a journalist but at the same time get a chance to interview celebrities as well
4590814 right now i plan to work on my writing and storytelling skills i want to hone that craft and theres no other way to do that but to buckle down and do the work
4590815 we had five entrants this year for the prizes they were all really outstanding but we chose ainsley and chris because their applications were particularly well written and extensive and theyre planning to go into a related field
4590816 im very excited about becoming the head coach at keene state the program has so much potential and its a great campus as far as recruiting is concerned
4590817 i think we can accomplish those goals while also providing a fun environment for the players
4590818 we have a very young team with the talent and enthusiasm to be successful
4590819 the fda alone simply lacks the ability to serve as the sole guarantor of drug safety
4590820 the fda would be stripped of an essential source of information that the agency has consistently relied on when making its regulatory decisions and the american public would be deprived of a vital deterrent against pharmaceutical company misconduct
4590821 the law in the devices case had a pre emption provision
4590822 congress has never put a pre emption provision in the food and drug act
4590823 fda considers and approves specific labeling for a drug and the drug manufacturer is generally barred from making unilateral changes to the fda approved labeling
4590824 even if the fda is doing the best it can it simply cant see the future clearly enough to pre empt manufacturers from litigation
4590825 the court system represents one of the key defense mechanisms that individuals have if a manufacturer has not made the risks of a product clear to the public
4590826 the only times i really smoke is when ive had a drink
4590827 ive heard a lot of stories in my time they went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs
4590828 bypassed at border inspectors arent using technology claiming laser visas cause backups at international crossings
4590829 you see it was the only workers i could get
4590830 we didnt just go into el mirage and surprise and do a sweep like people think we did because thats not true
4590831 bypassed at border inspectors arent using technology claiming laser visas cause backups at international crossings
4590832 you see it was the only workers i could get
4590833 therefore since we have been justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ there is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in christ jesus
4590834 in my courtroom you have not only been aquitted from your crimes and absolved of your debt but you are counted as righteous adopted as a son and given an inheritance

4590836 dat i wit body and so bof in wife and in def annot m own but bewong to my fay fo sav o deesus quise
4590837 that i with body and soul both in life and in death am not my own but belong to my faithful savior jesus christ
4590838 who with his precious blood has fully satisfied for all my sins and redeemed me from all the power of the devil and so preserves me that without the will of my father in heaven not a hair can fall from my head indeed that all things must work together for my salvation wherefore by his holy spirit he also assures me of eternal life and makes me heartily willing and ready from now on to live unto him
4590839 i think the clincher here will be when you tell her you actually own bibles and simply just dont rent them girls tend to like a man of means
4590840 if meat isnt good for me to eat then please take away my desire for it
4590841 she fell off her bike shes fine though they dont speak english so you cant talk to them
4590842 i think shed be a better judge of whether or not it hurts enough for her to go to the hospital dont you think
4590843 theres no need for you to be so rude to them so just calm down
4590844 you made a difference with that guy do you think he would have gone and gotten a first aid kit if you hadnt driven up
4590845 theyre threatening my life because i blew off a fat chick on the internet
4590846 the measured conductivity records the worlds highest value among soft materials
4590847 its a valuable contribution to an important emerging field of technology
4590848 this and so many other applications depend on the landmark advance of a team scaling up their production of ultralong carbon nanotubes
4590849 targeted single wall carbon nanotube mediated pt iv prodrug delivery using folate as a homing device
4590850 this result provides fundamental information about atomic scale fabrication and could pave the way for new data storage and memory devices
4590851 our mission is to create the foundation for what could someday be called the ibm nanoconstruction company
4590852 the force needed to move an atom on a surface
4590853 how much force does it take to move an atom on a surface
4590854 while gold nanoparticles are being used by so many researchers chemists materials scientists and biomedical engineers no one understood their molecular and electronic structures until now
4590855 this discovery contradicted what most chemists believed was going on which was that the sulfur atom merely sat atop the uppermost gold layer bound to three adjacent metal atoms
4590856 in 2006 we predicted that gold atoms in this bonding motif were divided in two groups those that made the metal core and those that helped to protected it
4590857 the theoretical concepts published in this paper provide a solid background for further understanding of the distinct electrical optical and chemical properties of the stable mono layer protected gold nanoclusters
4590858 we now have a unified model that provides a solid background for nanoengineering ligand protected gold clusters for applications in catalysis sensing photonics bio labeling and molecular electronics
4590859 its ultimate utility has been limited by problems with throughput cost and complexity
4590860 its like you have millions of nanogenerators outputting electricity simultaneously each at maximum performance
4590861 implanted sensors based on the fiber nanogenerator concept could use blood pressure or muscle movement for operation
4590862 other extrinsic sources in todays fairly dirty graphene samples add some extra resistivity to graphene
4590863 so the overall resistivity isnt quite as low as coppers at room temperature yet however graphene has far fewer electrons than copper so in graphene the electrical current is carried by only a few electrons moving much faster than the electrons in copper
4590864 interestingly in semiconducting carbon nanotubes which may be thought of as graphene rolled into a cylinder weve shown that the mobility at room temperature is over 100 000 cm2 vs
4590865 if you provide electrons with a defined pathway to the electrode you can reduce some of the inefficiencies that currently plague thin film solar cells made from polymer mixtures more efficient transport of electrons and holes collectively known as carriers is critical for creating more efficient solar cells
4590866 if nanowires are going to be used massively in photovoltaic devices then the growth mechanism of nanowires on arbitrary metallic surfaces is an issue of great importance
4590867 we contributed one approach to growing nanowires directly on metal
4590868 just a layer of metal can work in this paper we used ito but you can use other metals including aluminum
4590869 by growing nanowires directly on an untreated electrode surface you can start thinking about incorporating millions or billions of nanowires in a single device i think this is where the field is eventually going to end up
4590870 but i think we are at least a decade away from this becoming a mainstream technology
4590871 in effect we used nanowires to extend an electrode into the polymer material
4590872 the polymers degrade quickly when exposed to air researchers around the world are working to improve the properties of organic polymers
4590873 people need to know this is the real jon powers
4590874 he flagrantly disrespects a police officer is found guilty of disorderly conduct and never tells anyone after 10 years of scandal and embarrassing headlines we dont need more of the same we deserve a congressman who will tell the truth
4590875 at a time when hes under investigation and running from revelations of election fraud and bribery the davis campaign is practicing the lowest form of politics by distorting simple facts
4590876 jon was written a ticket for jaywalking never arrested and never showed any disrespect to law enforcement
4590877 the fundamental idea of forestry is the perpetuation of forests by use protection is not an end of itself it is a means to increase and sustain the resources of our country and the industries which depend upon them the preservation of our forests is an imperative business necessity
4590878 allow the state to receive higher revenues as the price of natural gas increased
4590879 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
4590880 we know best so we will determine your best interests for you
4590881 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

4590885 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4590886 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4590887 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4590888 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4590889 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4590890 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4590891 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4590892 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4590893 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4590894 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4590895 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4590896 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4590897 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4590898 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4590899 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4590900 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4590901 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4590902 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4590903 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4590904 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4590905 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4590906 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4590907 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4590908 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4590909 electricity at some of these locations is nonexistent but we overcame this challenge by installing the alternative power sources
4590910 we have invested heavily in these base stations which run on alternative energy sources to ensure that every kenyan can access our services
4590911 we have noted great demand for communication in these remote areas we find that even before we have installed the sites the communities have bought phones and airtime as they wait for the base station to be commissioned
4590912 our aim is to provide voice and data services anywhere in the country safaricom will continue to upgrade the network and improve the quality of service

4590921 we are strongly opposed to giving any safe exit to musharraf
4590922 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4590923 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4590924 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4590925 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

4590935 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4590936 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4590937 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4590938 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4590939 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4590940 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4590941 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4590942 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4590943 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4590944 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4590945 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4590946 il devrait tre tout fait clair pr sent que la bce nest pas encline abaisser les taux tant que subsiste une menace inflationniste de ce point de vue il se peut bien quon connaisse une p riode de paralysie mon taire

4590948 il faudra attendre un peu avant que la bce nassouplisse sa position mais pas au del du premier semestre de lann e prochaine
4590949 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4590950 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4590951 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4590952 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4590953 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4590954 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4590955 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4590956 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4590957 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4590958 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4590959 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4590960 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4590961 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4590962 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4590963 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4590964 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4590965 why settle for small sites at the beach where you can hear your neighbors breathing
4590966 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4590967 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4590968 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4590969 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4590970 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4590971 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4590972 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4590973 who are open to doing something on the production side
4590974 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4590975 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4590976 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4590977 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4590978 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4590979 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4590980 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground

4591193 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4591194 absolutely clearly demonstrates what we had said earlier the deployment has the russian federation as its target
4591195 it is sad news for all who live on this densely populated continent but it is not dramatic
4591196 poland is an independent country and its an ally of the united states and its a democratic country to whose security the united states is committed
4591197 russia should welcome having democracies on its border not threaten them
4591198 i think the russian behavior over the last several days is generally concerning not only to the united states but to all of our european allies
4591199 from my point of view this deal is not directed against russia
4591200 we will continue to advocate that talks be continued on how we can convince russia of this and also include it
4591201 can execute its nuclear mission in a safe secure and reliable manner
4591202 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4591203 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4591204 unless pursuant to the written regulations or written authorization of the institution
4591205 hope for a better world part 1 the future our planet
4591206 in joy we live celebrating swami kriyanandas 60 years of discipleship and anandas 40th anniversary
4591207 so i was curious about this dude and wikipediad him and found out he named each of his dogs charles and i thought it might be interesting to
4591208 we are not hearing concern about tco from our larger customers
4591209 we dont give a crap about oracle we chose you over oracle and your tco is way too high aggressively manage your maintenance charges aggressively manage your systems integrators aggressively automate operations and upgrades lower our tco
4591210 mr tandy is a client of ours and we are in the process of launching civil proceedings
4591211 as a result of the assault by joey barton our client has suffered a major psychiatric deterioration in his health that has destroyed any chance he may have had of playing professional football at a high level
4591212 lived in his car off and on until it was towed
4591213 as a result of talking with wilson bpd would characterize him as having faced and continues to face personal challenges he can best speak to what those are
4591214 bpd and ucpd are surprised that we had not had contact with wilson prior to last night
4591215 we identified him as the missing texas student and contacted berkeley police to let them know we had located him
4591216 we allowed them to interrogate him they want to hold him for psychological evaluation as soon as the evaluation is complete we will bring him back and continue our investigation
4591217 we have a criminal case against him for possession of stolen university utilities
4591218 they were heading toward sunnys but instead made the turn map toward van brunt with the ikea straight ahead down beard street
4591219 our most urgent task today is the immediate and orderly withdrawal of russian armed forces and the return of those forces to russia
4591220 agreement includes a provision for independent monitors and an eventual reconstruction plan for georgias economy
4591221 the united states and our allies stand with the people of georgia and their democratically elected government georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected moscow must honor its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4591222 then the next thing i know is he had overthrown shevardnadze
4591223 the federal circuit held this week in jacobsen v katzer that java model railroad interface author robert jacobsens release of software under the artistic license gave him the right to sue for copyright infringement those who distributed modified jmri software without obeying the conditions of its license the decision confirms an important cornerstone to many of the open source and free software licenses taking the work without accepting its licenses conditions is an infringement of copyright subject to all of copyrights enforcement options users of free and open source licenses or creative commons licenses for non software works offer their works to the world on a non exclusive basis on a set of conditions in the artistic license those conditions are
4591224 its been clear from the start that information appliances like the iphone tethered to their vendors would have a kill switch thats just a subset of the vendors in the case apples ability to reprogram any aspect of the phone from a distance at any time in a world of third party apps that means that apple could kill any app too after some breathless reporting caused by the discovery of a web page meant for consultion by iphones that lists bad apps and debate about whether the switch was more modest say only to say which apps wouldnt be allowed to use the iphones gps functionality as a way to protect user privacy steve jobs confirmed that any app can be killed
4591225 chinas system of filtering websites by blocking web addresses and keywords of overseas websites has come to be known as the great firewall
4591226 the great firewall is only one small part of chinese internet censorship
4591227 censorship foreigners dont see stuff that didnt fit in my op ed
4591228 the folks at pingdom a company focused on server performance monitoring posted a fascinating little piece of research based on googles insights for search tool im interested both in their specific research question what social network tools are popular in what parts of the world and the richness of the data available via this tool from google basically im feeling boneheaded that i hadnt realized this data set was available the pingdom folks tried a simple experiment using search insight to search for information on a dozen social networking sites the insight tool reveals how popular searches for particular terms are and where in the world those searches are coming from
4591229 this week were taking a break from all the interviews to give you a glimpse of the world of digital dossiers your dossier is made up of all the digital tracks you leave behind from your photos on flickr to the facebook messages you send to all the data your credit card company collects about your transactions on a daily basis digital natives are consistently leaving information about themselves in secure or non secure databases you probably do this without a second thought in you day to day life but have you ever considered the amount of information being collected about you or the extent to which this information spreads
4591230 canada will now embark on its own journey on the search for these two vessels which has the allure of an indiana jones mystery
4591231 the franklin expedition is a key part of canadas history of arctic exploration as canada is once again asserting ourselves and protecting our sovereignty in the high arctic this expedition will provide important new information and will add to the body of research on the fate of these ships
4591232 we have staked our claim its use it or lose it for far too long our country has not had a strong presence in the far north
4591233 its been so long that i dont remember having two arms
4591234 i never had the time to sit around and worry about losing an arm
4591235 he was a wonderful neighbor who would do anything for anybody he was a very inventive man he only had one arm and had to learn how to skin that cat many ways we are really going to miss him
4591236 b g used to come in here every day ive known him all my life
4591237 b g got sick with pneumonia during that time and put her in a nursing home until he got well
4591238 he went back and got her and took care of her for years with that one arm he was there for her until she died you dont find many men like that anymore
4591239 i been knowing b g since i was born and im 67 now
4591240 he was a good friend of my husband and me and got to be a better friend the older he got he used to go out and eat supper with us
4591241 b g was a very faithful servant of society hill
4591242 although i didnt serve under him he left a legacy for us to build on he was an outstanding citizen who will really be missed
4591243 in a nutshell you drive sober or you end up in the slammer bottom line
4591244 most people think a lot of impressive arrest numbers will come out of this operation and theres no doubt that these numbers will be impressive
4591245 but the most impressive thing is the lives that are saved
4591246 some still consider it socially acceptable to drink and drive
4591247 people that wouldnt break in to someones house or steal a grape from the grocery store will drink and drive
4591248 as difficult as it is to get that call that somebodys been locked up it would be much better than to receive the phone call that i got
4591249 what does that sucker know about it hes never been here anyway
4591250 when it was common to trade a rifle for a good hunting dog
4591251 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring
4591252 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry
4591253 inconsistencies and inadequacies which limit the interpretations of the findings
4591254 for this to come out on a friday afternoon just before california takes action it definitely raises some eyebrows
4591255 we have locally based writers who have a boot or we like to say heels on the ground approach to collecting this kind of information
4591256 you definitely get overwhelmed and its definitely an all consuming process my family and friends have had to be very very patient with me
4591257 its nice having your best friend be your business partner
4591258 even if youre on a stay cation this year thats even more of an excuse to explore the city where you live and find new stores there washington is exploding in terms of retail and theres so much to discover here
4591259 the fda alone simply lacks the ability to serve as the sole guarantor of drug safety
4591260 the fda would be stripped of an essential source of information that the agency has consistently relied on when making its regulatory decisions and the american public would be deprived of a vital deterrent against pharmaceutical company misconduct
4591261 the law in the devices case had a pre emption provision
4591262 congress has never put a pre emption provision in the food and drug act
4591263 fda considers and approves specific labeling for a drug and the drug manufacturer is generally barred from making unilateral changes to the fda approved labeling
4591264 we want him to be a little bit more dominant a little bit more physical
4591265 but he has everything he has all the tools has the attitude
4591266 you know to go in with no expectations or low expectations to me doesnt do much for me
4591267 i think arian has stayed under the radar has been under appreciated a bit
4591268 my hope is he stays healthy and takes his game to the next level and becomes the all time leading rusher in tennessee history when you think of all the backs that have been through there thats quite impressive
4591269 we have very good level players our chemistry is strong we just need to keep building and hopefully that will lead to a championship
4591270 hillary clintons campaign made history this year with 18 million women and men across the country voting for her in the primaries
4591271 and she will make history yet again when delegates from nearly every state in the nation will be able to take the floor and proudly say clintons name in the roll call vote
4591272 gerhartsreiter is at the center of the longest con i have ever seen in my professional career
4591273 two thirds of these men are not from the neighborhood
4591274 i suspect none of them would want that conduct to take place in front of their kids or in their neighborhoods and our message is to stop it on new haven streets and were going to continue this process until we get that message out that people deserve better neighborhoods than that we are convinced if we could stop some of this action the neighbors will be willing to step up when they realize the city cares the police department cares they will step up and help us with the other issues
4591275 i was at one community meeting where a woman told me she was really tired of looking out her kitchen window and seeing sex performed in front of her house she had thought about moving from new haven and thats wrong shes like a prisoner in her own home
4591276 i have heard that they get anywhere from 70 to 200
4591277 people start up the vehicle and it sounds like a motorcycle
4591278 he knew what was going on and called the sheriffs office they were right there and apprehended this guy they got the converter he was almost done stealing and got three more he had stolen in the parking lot
4591279 if you are driving through a parking lot and see somebody tinkering they may be up to no good
4591280 sending 15 000 journalists to the conventions remains a shameful waste
4591281 what does that sucker know about it hes never been here anyway
4591282 when it was common to trade a rifle for a good hunting dog
4591283 the only thing keeping us from having a robust economy
4591284 if she was serious about doing something about gas prices she would have voted for the drill act and cracking down on speculators rather than participating in election year theatrics in washington
4591285 we need to collect evidence before we go to court and were not saying were going to court tomorrow but at least with the new law microsoft has to be more careful
4591286 the uptake of office is at the lowest its been in the last couple of years so while nothings put a dent in the armor at this point perhaps there is some crumbling and the opportunity for a lower priced offering to make some inroads
4591287 given its capabilities theres no indication why it wouldnt be seen as an alternative to microsoft
4591288 this is the equivalent to forcing china to pirate the product
4591289 to try and level the playing filed between western products and native products
4591290 they are understandably not happy about foreign companies owning the bulk of the software sales in their own market
4591291 local software products of any kind pay off for microsoft
4591292 once a country has its own software businesses that countrys political leaders will start to get serious about stopping piracy so microsoft might well root for evermore
4591293 the asian market represents a wealth of opportunities but i guess the bigger issue is are people going to pay for software
4591294 microsoft of course still has the lions share of the market
4591295 we dont want to compete with that for media coverage
4591296 what does that sucker know about it hes never been here anyway
4591297 when it was common to trade a rifle for a good hunting dog
4591298 it was you who ran this and it wasnt just to support your habit
4591299 a lot of it was greed and for that you must be punished
4591300 because of a malicious politically motivated act of charles schumer our lives have been shattered
4591301 i look deep inside my soul and wonder what my father would tell me
4591302 im not going to be swimming when im 40 no way
4591303 i not only felt i was blindsided by what was taking place but this board was acting not so much like a judge and jury but to me more like a kangaroo court
4591304 the actions of this board in looking to satisfy the concerns of the fire personnel on some comments i made at a brush fire at my residence have now become completely political in nature and represent little more than character assassination
4591305 in summary one need not be an attorney educated in the law to know that robert j higgins was unquestionably deprived of the fundamental rights of all citizens to due process of the law
4591306 i think that we have an obligation as citizens in our town that we treat each other with decency
4591307 and then the snake sort of blew up it left something i couldnt see what because it went all black after that and then i woke up
4591308 i know it seems kinda stupid to be afraid of that but at the time it was al are you alright
4591309 the same dream the exact same i i had it too
4591310 something is too wrong you always make lame jokes when somethings wrong
4591311 d do you think we should tell mum or dad
4591312 i want you guys to go back to bed well talk about this more once weve all got some sleep
4591313 i suspected something when i found the first bird in gabon since it didnt exactly match any of the species descriptions in the field guides
4591314 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special
4591315 although finding an unknown species like the olive backed forest robin was not the goal of the project it is definitely a reminder that the world still holds surprises for us
4591316 the big question is not what pervez musharraf is going to do but whats going to happen to him next
4591317 i dont think he can be given safe passage anywhere except to jail if you think about it it would be a problem for any country to take him in because al qaeda has said that he will be unsafe wherever he goes
4591318 we are not against general musharraf as a person but we are against the dictators who have subverted the constitution of pakistan they should be made to stand trial
4591319 if the courts find any evidence against him it is for them to decide if the penalty will be death or a life sentence
4591320 he will remain the center of a lot of political attention a lot of anger a lot of resentment and possibly even some revenge
4591321 if he stays it wont be the life of a normal citizen
4591322 but i do want to know how they handle a crisis because a lot of the things in the presidency often deal with things you dont know are going to happen that we dont know will happen in the next four years there are a lot of different things you can deal with in the life of a leader that will tell us more about the candidate than some of the typical questions
4591323 i can tell you this theyre not a monolithic bloc as the press frequently tries to make them out to be i think that for many evangelicals theyre not convinced that either of these men is an evangelical they may be believers in christ they may be christian but they want to know for instance their world view and they want to hear it out
4591324 im unashamed and unembarrassed about my deep faith in god but i do not obviously try to impose my views on others
4591325 registrou crescimento http www1 folha uol com br folha dinheiro ult91u433822 shtml ficando em territ rio positivo com 2 8 pontos em agosto contra 4 92 pontos em julho no ndice empire state
4591326 all of our teachers with implementing the georgia curriculum are very serious about teaching the standards and they have high levels of expectations for their students and it has a ripple effect so you end up with a success all the way across the board
4591327 the 2008 act report is good news across the board
4591328 in a year when the national average went down georgia saw improvement in all areas by all students
4591329 this is yet another example of the positive momentum in georgias schools as teachers students and parents are working hard to improve student achievement and performance
4591330 these increases are happening even as more and more georgia students are taking the act
4591331 there is still work to be done but we are making tremendous progress in a short period of time
4591332 as is usually the case in georgia when you break down the numbers into subgroups you get a truer picture of how we are doing as a state
4591333 every subgroup is scoring above the national average and all boats are rising
4591334 we are making progress but have a long way to go
4591335 well close that gap as we continue to provide a rigorous and relevant education to all students
4591336 the act report fully supports the work we are doing with our curriculum especially in the area of mathematics
4591337 as we continue the implementation in high school i am confident we will see continued increases in our scores and more importantly the number of students who are college and work ready
4591338 we are preparing our students for the 21st century by requiring them to learn the skills and ideas that colleges and businesses expect
4591339 this will help secure the future of our students and provide a better prepared workforce for georgias businesses
4591340 although stevens knowingly carried debt on a 31 000 interest free loan from his personal friend for more than 10 months during 2001 stevens did not list such a liability on his 2001 disclosure form
4591341 allen offered to get stevens daughter a new car in exchange for the 1999 land rover and stevens agreed
4591342 for the purpose of hiding allens involvement in the transaction
4591343 i saw sen stevens at lunch and he asked if you im not sure why he mentioned it to me but he asked me to i think find out if you had any business contacts in phoenix with respect to his son who is down there who finds himself without a job at this point
4591344 stevens son accepted the position with veco and also received a personal loan from allen
4591345 im gonna try to see if i can get some bigwigs from back here to go up there and say look uh you just gotta make up your mind you gotta get this done
4591346 urging it to cease infighting and pass the pipeline legislation before liquefied natural gas monopolizes the marketplace
4591347 the sense of the marketplace is that we are ascending
4591348 usually these guys sell a high percentage of their inventory
4591349 its a pretty accurate number they have doubled their purchases
4591350 the big sellers are the player t shirts from majestic
4591351 majestic has told us we are the no 1 team in baseball in terms of player t shirts
4591352 michigan needs more nurses to meet our immediate and developing health care needs
4591353 and we need a thriving health care sector that provides our citizens with good paying jobs our michigan nursing corps is making sure we achieve both of these important goals
4591354 all of us at some point in our lives will need medical care
4591355 whether its the serious care of a hospital or treatment at a doctors office the quality of care that we receive is greatly influenced by the care and compassion of the nurses that we meet
4591356 im still not convinced that he actually was born a natural born citizen
4591357 i still keep wondering about his birthplace and his birth certificate im still not convinced that he actually was born a natural born citizen
4591358 i work with digital images all the time and this one looks like its been tampered with
4591359 arcosanti is both a success and a failure a failure in that it is less than what its founder had hoped it would be yet an extraordinary success in that it is actually there inhabited and changing peoples lives
4591360 its greatest success has been its prescience in the field of architecture and the environment
4591361 this is not the perfect arcology but its a place to experiment
4591362 it is designed to human size phoenix is designed to car size
4591363 it took a lot of labor to build these walls
4591364 i dont know if they charmed them or drugged them
4591365 but their tails are down so they arent stressed this is real storytelling
4591366 nat rlich w re die entscheidung nicht bindend aber ich kann sagen dass serbien jede entscheidung akzeptieren wird die das gericht f llt
4591367 ele achou o menino dentro da bacia todo enrolado em papel higi nico
4591368 you can live without an arm they can always bolt on a new one
4591369 i love this guy hell make such great target practice
4591370 if i wanted to tell you i would wouldnt i
4591371 youve got me i hate that shirt in fact i think youre a crummy dresser period
4591372 what does that sucker know about it hes never been here anyway
4591373 when it was common to trade a rifle for a good hunting dog
4591374 you can go anywhere in the world and people will say canton
4591375 he used to be in a really terrible band that he left because he felt that it was a destructive force in art and he has his own band black light burns but now he is in marilyn manson we dont know how permanent that is but starting tomorrow will be the first step so this will be the most indestructible marilyn manson
4591376 im italian from birth but its only become fact today
4591377 there was a moment in which i considered accepting the offer and saying yes to the ghana side but then the idea of playing for the country where i have been since birth prevailed
4591378 now im waiting for a call from italy coach marcello lippi or under 21 coach pierluigi casiraghi
4591379 what i love the most about him is that he has very soft eyes
4591380 even though he doesnt have much experience and hes not ready to lead that doesnt mean he cant be dreamy
4591381 and as washington embraced him john mccain hugged right back
4591382 mr gambari looks forward to returning to myanmar and continuing his consultations with the government and other relevant parties
4591383 on our part there were no casualties just a few injuries
4591384 the reality is that there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off of a presidential campaign we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means necessary
4591385 im saying theres been this fictionalized life story put out by obama in his autobiography that has been magnified during the campaign and the truth is dramatically different in many instances from what obama represents
4591386 if the fundamental smear of unfit for command was that john kerry was no war hero the insinuation of mr corsis latest is that mr obama is a closet muslim and militant black activist drug user
4591387 it will spur debate and i think sen obama should get used to a very critical examination of his history and his tenure in the u s senate the same thing is also going to happen to sen mccain
4591388 just as unfit for command contains false attacks on sen john kerrys military service the obama nation similarly contains numerous falsehoods about sen barack obama
4591389 several of the books accusations are unsubstantiated misleading or inaccurate
4591390 the time for conversations has passed the time for concrete action has come
4591391 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4591392 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4591393 russian forces need to leave georgia at once this is no longer 1968
4591394 not only those people who perpetrated this but those who failed to stop it
4591395 the deployment of new anti missile forces has as its aim the russian federation
4591396 therefore any fairy tales about deterring other states fairy tales that with the help of this system we will deter some sort of rogue states no longer work
4591397 we very much want the six point plan to be implemented very promptly so that russian troops are no longer in georgia outside abkhazia and south ossetia
4591398 our resolution does not contain the way serbia sees the unilateral declaration of independence
4591399 we dont want to put countries of the world in a situation to vote for our point of view or for anybody elses point of view we ask the support for this thing to be referred to the international court of justice
4591400 i can say that serbia is going to accept any opinion that comes from the icj
4591401 i think this is the way forward that has to be supported by opponents and supporters of kosovos independence alike
4591402 i think we should all come together in supporting international law
4591403 gerhartsreiter is at the center of the longest con i have ever seen in my professional career
4591404 at this time a wide majority of them have announced plans to waive extra baggage fees for military personnel traveling on orders or have never had a fee in place
4591405 the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe has as its aim the russian federation
4591406 the moment has been chosen well and therefore any fairy tales about deterring other states fairy tales that with the help of this system we will deter some sort of rogue states no longer work
4591407 ive made very clear that we were going to sign that agreement as soon as poland and the united states had come to terms and weve now come to terms
4591408 this is helping them identify capabilities this is largely polish funding of their modernization efforts
4591409 me gusta tu blog entr al m o www lagarompa com
4591410 me llevo la ropa los botines lo que no encuentro por ning n lado son las manos
4591411 we have a lock down situation we have cameras but the question we had to answer is what if somebody gets in what are we going to do
4591412 a friend of all people in the world even israelis and americans
4591413 despite the fact that more than 200 legislators asked for the vice presidents dismissal the number of protesters was small maybe one reason is that a specific group of students organized it
4591414 trucks to bring in raw materials and special foods are in limited supply and those that are available are strictly regulated to reduce air pollution prior to the games
4591415 george is devastated by the allegations filed by the court he is devastated and saddened that pam has aired the alleged dirty laundry i dont know what im going to hear next about george he loves his kids so much
4591416 we couldnt be more delighted and proud to kick off our inaugural slate of hot ticket programming with cirque du soleils delirium
4591417 its the perfect marriage to have such a visually exciting multimedia show as
4591418 we are happy to take this opportunity to bring the cirque du soleil experience to a new entertainment environment
4591419 we believe that delirium in hd will offer audiences a memorable experience in movie theaters because of its magnitude the energy of the performers and the diversity of its music going from percussion to electronic music
4591420 i am really happy with this one of a kind production since the use of twenty cameras allowed us to both capture the spectacular scale and nature of the show along with the incredible skill and intimate interaction of the fabulous cirque du soleil artists
4591421 trucks to bring in raw materials and special foods are in limited supply and those that are available are strictly regulated to reduce air pollution prior to the games
4591422 she in fact has a new management team in place and lots of ambitious plans
4591423 its a new chapter in her life and shes anxious to put her stamp on the club
4591424 they have merely wanted to be paid what they were owed and for the club to be on the financial footing it is now on
4591425 the army chief has told him musharraf very clearly that he will have to face the impeachment on his own the army will not be a party between him and the civilian government
4591426 his body language suggested to me that he is not willing to face the parliament he thinks it will be a matter of shame for him if he will have to appear before the parliament

4591444 when i described it to the officer he took the time to listen he understood
4591445 i thought hed say its just a doll i cant say enough about the police there they were wonderful

4591455 he taught me that government service is an honorable path
4591456 my big summer job through most of undergrad was working at kentucky fried chicken
4591457 like a lot of my friends i would have loved to do something more substantive but i needed the summer to earn money for the following year
4591458 unlike the majority of my peers i was actually doing legal work before i ever stepped foot in law school
4591459 all too often in law school i saw fellow students discover too late that being a lawyer was not the right choice for them
4591460 but im really glad that well be able to help on the experiential side thanks to ms hills generosity
4591461 i have never texted or emailed senator obama and ill offer a million dollars to anyone who could prove otherwise in fact ive only talked to the senator once in the last year and a half on the phone

4591472 if you feel your clothes coming loose or your bra slipping it can be a bit scary but you cant panic or at least let it show
4591473 there are discussions but it is not a done deal yet we are optimistic
4591474 i dont know the man but i grew up watching him on tv
4591475 the whole thing was pretty scary and reminded eugenia and i of show trials

4591481 as his teacher i know that he is very aggressive and motivated in the knock out stages before the finals i still remember the way he dominated the match against nigerian nestor bolum in the semi final in the 2006 commonwealth games then defeated mauritian bruno julie in the final
4591482 vijender and jitender have been doing well in their respective categories im keeping my fingers crossed and lets not forget that it aint over till it is over
4591483 my dad is the reason why i became olympic champion today
4591484 i suspected something when i found the first bird in gabon since it didnt exactly match any of the species descriptions in the field guides
4591485 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special
4591486 although finding an unknown species like the olive backed forest robin was not the goal of the project it is definitely a reminder that the world still holds surprises for us

4591522 thinking beyond the contemporary mantra of democracy elections and decentralization
4591523 a tension at the international level between promoting poverty reduction and promoting competitive multi party democracy
4591524 in many cases democracies produce governments which are very effective in reducing poverty witness recent experience in brazil for example
4591525 there are less democratic regimes which have been and are very effective in reducing poverty and the international community needs to recognise that part of this effectiveness may be due to the nature of the regime where a strong connection between regime and citizens has been forged through a popular movement which generates a social compact between elite and the poor as part of a national development project
4591526 china and vietnam would also be examples and there are others during the last 60 years the implication for the international community would be to exercise caution in attaching political conditionalities to aid or other international negotiations of course this does not mean that in extreme cases eg zimbabwe the international community should not take a strong political position
4591527 we need to talk about this especially after traumatic events autocracies may do nation building more effectively than elected governments there is more to politics than ballot counting
4591528 shoring up fragile states should be as important to donors as tackling climate change
4591529 a declaration that the sale of scratchcards held out to be in support of a charity where the actual charitable contribution made is less than 50 per cent is materially detrimental to or inconsistent with the good name goodwill reputation and image of the licensor sir stelios
4591530 i feel it is best to ask a judge to interpret certain clauses in the brand licence and in particular the so called 75 25 rule
4591531 based upon our clear legal advice we fully comply with the 75 25 rule in the brand licence and significantly more than 90 per cent of revenues are derived from core activity

4591543 giza has been criticized for buying the 27 000 vehicle through county bid instead of putting it out for public bid he had the choice of using a pre approved state or county bid list and if he didnt then the purchase would have had to go out for bids because it was greater than 10 000
4591544 since giza followed the rules on completing the purchase no confusion should exist
4591545 furthermore if residents had such issues with the purchase why didnt they come out during the public hearing about the budget to voice their concerns
4591546 were all for protecting taxpayer money accountability of elected officials and questioning representatives about the towns finances turning some of the questions into faux controversies is nothing but counterproductive
4591547 normally the state or county is the cheapest way to go

4591562 is that what you plan to say on judgment day
4591563 if you flood people with noise and move towards them it increases their physical threat as the brain is subjected to a multi sensory impact
4591564 this does not evoke sympathy because there is acute threat and instead the reflective part of the brain is shutdown and you cant reason that it is not real
4591565 the extreme noise causes the brain to feel confused and i know some people who would be tipped over the edge from this show your reaction has been similar to that of a trauma victim
4591566 this is a violent very brutal and noisy show and people have found it too much and left

4591571 please do not send cash and be cautious when responding to any correspondence or calls if it sounds too good to be true it usually is
4591572 we do receive reports similar to this on a regular basis and its sad when somebody of this mans age is targeted and has a lot of money stolen
4591573 id have responded to that because theyd have been owning the request
4591574 there were very mixed views about the alternative to howard namely peter costello
4591575 in the end we decided that unless the pm would say that he had decided to stand down then there would be no change
4591576 he spent 30 minutes telling me why peter couldnt win he had more show of winning than peter
4591577 i found none of it compelling i spent 30 minutes putting my case and he spent 30 minutes responding
4591578 if my senior colleagues were as a group prepared to own a request for me to go id have gone
4591579 but i was not going to out of the blue go because i didnt think that would have produced a different result and that i would have rightly been criticised for cowardice
4591580 as the election campaign wore on the departure was getting further and further extended
4591581 what other answer could i have given oh no no i cant beat him again i mean ridiculous
4591582 youd have to ask him whether he accepted it not well he didnt
4591583 could have easily said one term two terms one and a half terms
4591584 i certainly would have given a clear indication to him that if i became prime minister i wasnt going to stay forever

4591604 the government will issue necessary orders at the earliest to implement the decision of the union government regarding the recommendations of the sixth pay commission for union government employees to the satisfaction of more than 10 lakh employees of the government of tamil nadu
4591605 the expectations of the people are also going up earlier 40 000 deliveries were done in primary health centres but last year the figure went up to 1 83 lakh
4591606 for many years they have been demanding timescale of pay this government has decided to grant them a separate special timescale of pay
4591607 among them a situation exists wherein employees working for more than 25 years are getting the same salary as the new recruits this government has decided to provide an increment for every 10 years of service and increase the pay based on seniority

4591648 it was a hard night at the office and very disappointing for a couple of these guys that have put such a great effort into this campaign
4591649 to have things go the way they did tonight was a really tough start for them the team competition is in two days time and everybody starts on a clean slate so thats the way weve got to look at it from here

4591720 sa ka la represents a side of mr fosse that american audiences have yet to see this play is poignant and funny at the same time its about family dynamics and how quickly time flies mr fosse writes about something that everyone can relate to which rounds out the body of work oslo elsewhere is creating in american english both in production and in published form
4591721 mr fosse has been compared to ibsen and to beckett and it is easy to see his work as ibsen stripped down to its emotional essentials but it is much more for one thing it has a fierce poetic simplicity
4591722 the cast of deathvariations is sometimes stunningly in touch with mr fosses worldview and no small credit goes to sarah cameron sunde who both translated and directed

4591747 our stay at the villa was like a second honeymoon on one hand there was the sheer beauty of the surroundings hills and olive groves and ancient ruins on the other the proximity to rome and other intriguing destinations in italy and our hosts were so gracious in every way
4591748 la tartaruga sabina is a magical place my husband and i stayed there for our wedding anniversary and could not have been more pleased the scenery is breathtaking and the accommodations are warm and welcoming an added benefit is that youre a stones throw away from rome
4591749 staying at the villa was a totally pleasant experience it was quite relaxing the room was comfortable and the landscape beautiful spring flowers everywhere we loved it
4591750 dear giuseppe so were all back in london now trying to settle back into our routines the weather is not quite as good as it was i just wanted to thank you so much for our holiday we had the most amazing time eating and more importantly relaxing which was in the main part down to your hospitality and your truly amazing villa so from all of us a huge thank you

4591753 the house in corbere was truly delightful in the middle of a friendly village you must visit the pizza restaurant in the square just round the corner we had such a warm welcome from the owners and they make delicious pizzas too we really enjoyed our stay and it was lovely to be met by jean luc and lisa when we arrived and departed and have everything explained to us each of the bedrooms were very different and colour co ordinated the one on the top floor was our favourite we liked to cook in the evenings when we came back from our travels to the beach lakes and it was so nice to have a fully equipped kitchen with good quality crockery and cooking utensils the whole house is so well equipped you really dont need to take anything but yourselves there were so many dvds games and books to occupy us in the evenings and every night we sat outside in the walled patio to eat our meal and when the lights came on it was a delight the garden bench was a lovely place to sit with a glass or two of wine and a good book in the late afternoon bliss it was an ideal base for visiting spain too as it is not far from the border thanks again for sharing your house with us we have very fond memories of our holiday there and would certainly go again
4591754 we wanted to let you know how much we enjoyed our stay in corbere

4591758 no creemos en dictar y menos a n en controlar los trabajos de los reporteros asignados a cubrir las olimpiadas pero exigimos respeto respeto a nuestro esfuerzo valor y sobre todo a nuestro sacrificio
4591759 no se debe confundir nuestros resultados y nuestra felicidad de poder representar a puerto rico en tan sublime justa deportiva con el conformismo mal social que padecen muchos en nuestra sociedad todos nosotros atletas y entrenadores salimos a luchar por la victoria siempre

4591763 desde que habl en abril con martin oneill entrenador del aston villa no he vuelto a hablar con nadie del aston villa todas las negociaciones han sido entre rick parry y el due o y el director ejecutivo del aston villa as que si alguien quiere hablar en el futuro sobre barry tendr que hacerlo con parry
4591764 yo no he sido el que ha mantenido las conversaciones por barry yo no he sido el que ha mantenido conversaciones acerca de xabi alonso y el arsenal
4591765 todo el mundo ha estado hablando y est claro que algunos peri dicos y periodistas me culpan de todo del calentamiento global del aumento del precio del petr leo de todo
4591766 si quieren hablar de jugadores tienen que hablar con parry si quieren hablar de f tbol hablen conmigo
4591767 la plantilla es mejor tenemos algunos problemas en la izquierda porque hemos perdido al noruego john arne riise el australiano harry kewell y el argentino sebasti n leto unido al frustrado fichaje de barry por quien el aston villa solicit 22 8 millones de euros as que veremos qu ocurre en el futuro

4591771 the only thing keeping us from having a robust economy
4591772 if she was serious about doing something about gas prices she would have voted for the drill act and cracking down on speculators rather than participating in election year theatrics in washington
4591773 this is a doubled edged sword it will be helpful for exporters uk companies that have us earnings and the inbound tourist industry but it is unhelpful at a time when commodity prices which are priced in dollars are still very high
4591774 a year or two ago we would have said that a gentle decline in sterling would have been beneficial this decline has been too far and too fast because it coincides with record commodity prices and is adding to the cost of doing business
4591775 companies have managed to sustain export order books despite record sterling exporting to emerging economies has also provided something of a cushion while developed economies have been weakening however there is now uncertainty about demand in some of those key markets
4591776 we hope this weakness in the pound will last in the past 18 months it has been increasingly challenging to get us travellers to come to the uk because of the strength of the pound the high cost of flights and the poor economic health of their country

4591780 there is no nation on earth powerful enough to accomplish our overthrow our destruction should it come at all will be from another quarter from the inattention of the people to the concerns of their government from their carelessness and negligence i must confess that i do apprehend some danger i fear that they may place too implicit a confidence in their public servants and fail properly to scrutinize their conduct that in this way they may be made the dupes of designing men and become the instruments of their own undoing

4591784 if there is anything i am lacking in ive got to tell you it is taste in music and art and other great things in life

4591786 maybe im missing something here but if achmed the terrorist suddenly gets a perfect 2 inch hole that passes all the way through his head with nothing but a sizzling noise isnt everyone going to know it was the us that done it
4591787 i know that before i can win your vote i have to win your respect
4591788 there is very little enthusiasm for mccain with people i network with
4591789 his voting record on social conservative issues for the most part is good
4591790 it is a matter of enthusiasm he is a hard guy to get enthusiastic about and why i just dont know
4591791 he hasnt done anything to offend hes just ignored them and they dont like to be ignored
4591792 i think if he wants to re create the intensity that has been within the base in the last two election cycles which i think personally you are going to need to win i think he has to make social issues a part of his political portfolio that he talks about
4591793 our belief is that during the remainder of the general election we will be able to make a compelling case as to why people of faith and christians in this country do have very compelling reasons to vote for and support john mccain
4591794 beyond the choice of his running mate sen mccains comments raise questions about the type of individuals he would appoint to other important positions like hhs secretary and even judgeships
4591795 as it becomes clearer and clearer that a barack obama administration would be a disaster the numbers will be there
4591796 i think it would be to his advantage to speak more to those kinds of voters and when i think he does that he always does very well
4591797 i think we will see him do more of that as we go through this year

4591806 with a little cooperation we might find that craigslist can help to turn around newspapers
4591807 our inability to deliver small targeted audiences is a significant reason behind why newspaper classifieds arent selling as well as they used to
4591808 maybe we could stop blaming the customers or the competition or craig newmark and think up a classified product that people might actually like
4591809 we shouldnt be afraid to knock down our walls and share our classifieds with other newspapers or even with other websites

4591817 i n the senate barack obama has voted in lockstep with president george w bush nearly half the time including the bush cheney energy bill which gave close to 3 billion in new giveaways to big oil
4591818 gave close to 3 billion in new giveaways to big oil
4591819 voted for the bush energy bill in 2005 which gave tax breaks to big oil
4591820 included several oil and gas tax incentives providing about 2 6 billion of tax cuts for the oil and gas industry
4591821 provided for 2 9 billion of tax increases on the oil and gas industry for a net tax increase on the industry of nearly 300 million over 11 years
4591822 in the senate barack obama has voted in lockstep with president george w bush nearly half the time including the bush cheney energy bill which gave close to 3 billion in new giveaways to big oil a terrible policy that john mccain opposed
4591823 the truth is barack obamas plan is a job killing machine that ignores the struggling economy and raises taxes on family savings social security and small businesses
4591824 voted in lockstep with president george w bush nearly half the time
4591825 ethiopian convoys opened fire into different areas where thousands of displaced people were living they killed everyone on the road

4591829 they were the visualization and actualization of concern throughout indian country about the negative polices that would affect all indian life
4591830 it helped to send a message to the people who wanted these 13 anti indian bills that they best not move in those directions because people cared about it the president jimmy carter white house cared about it
4591831 it has demonstrated to us in the congress that climate change social injustice and a broken health care system are challenges that demand real solutions in the here and now
4591832 from the perspective of an activist you can see the history of indian people as a struggle
4591833 you can see where the pieces fit together like the longest walk of 1978 how its so different from this one and see why and how much things have changed in 30 years
4591834 change this relationship with indian people to assimilate native people and not deal with indian people as indian people but as ordinary citizens
4591835 stimulate young indian people to do something and give them self esteem
4591836 so he created walking and running teams across the country to try to get young people who have many social problems drugs suicide low self esteem alcoholism which is endemic to indian country high drop out rates involved what dennis has been doing is to encourage young people to have some reason to live
4591837 environmental concerns climate change those kinds of things are close to the hearts of all of us natives in this region
4591838 by virtue of being here in this land for a long time were quite connected to it in all kinds of ways
4591839 sometimes its hard to get attention especially of congress people who dont have very many natives in their areas and arent necessarily tuned in to these issues
4591840 so we have a huge problem with getting attention from the mainstream media and getting congressional attention that we need to make changes in our communities we have high rates of poverty health care problems very low education rates substance abuse all kinds of things that we need desperate help with
4591841 when you see the elders and people coming together you forget those things
4591842 there was something different about this one protecting mother earth and learning more traditional ways from my people
4591843 i do happen to know people that have died of this kind of cancer and so we watch it very closely
4591844 when the laser fires onto the lesion it emits light at a very specific frequency that causes oxygen radicals that destroy the lesion make it go away
4591845 there is some emerging data that the better we can kill off these early precancerous lesions that that might translate later down the road many many years to a decreasing in the development of cancers and thats the goal
4591846 im going to have to be aware of it for the rest of my life
4591847 coachella set theres been a pretty steady flow of material from the bands forthcoming comeback album i see houses

4591850 i am happy to say that the book exceeded my expectations and is a fun impossible to put down romp bristling with ingenious ideas and speculations
4591851 there is no divide to the air that we all breathe or the clean water that we all depend on
4591852 we know that when storms or other natural disasters occur they do not respect political boundaries we have to be prepared to work in praetorship
4591853 el h roe siempre debe de ser puro casto y sacrificar todo por el bien de muchos
4591854 cuando el mal gana debe de ser una derrota aplastante pica con el villano triunfante en la ultima vi eta del numero
4591855 lo triste que es ver un mundo caer ante el mal
4591856 hombre siempre atento siempre con un plan siempre un paso a delante
4591857 villano que cuenta monologo explicativo de c mo logro sus metas
4591858 but there is a pattern young pretty girl he plays the hero creates a situation where the girl is dependent on only him and gradually tears the girls away from their families yet as you noted with mister lazarus there was no sign of trouble until he arrived
4591859 not that i dont appreciate this information mister prime minister
4591860 but i have the feeling that you have been after this man for a long time i dont like to think of my daughter becoming collateral damage in your hunt for him
4591861 your daughter did me a great service before i came to office
4591862 for her encouragement i shall be forever grateful i shall personally do everything in my power to sever the doctors hold on martha jones
4591863 lincolnshire by the smell of it and according to the tardis its 1666
4591864 you cant believe me to believe you can smell where we are
4591865 for once it seems more likely to me that youve got the date right instead of our location
4591866 lets ask him where we are and when we are
4591867 what is this thing this peculiar thing which makes everything fall to the ground
4591868 which causes all objects with a mass to attract each other the apple has a mass and so does the earth so basically the earth keeps pulling at the apple until it finally falls of the branch that was holding it up against the laws of gravity so to say and at the same time as the apple falls it attracts the earth as well but then again the mass of the earth is obviously so big that you cant notice the difference although
4591869 you know mass multiplied by the gravitational acceleration and it keeps the earth in orbit around the sun spinning as the sun keeps pulling at it it holds the moon in place everything in our solar system and oh the whole universe really
4591870 was i going too fast really try and get a copy of philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica if youre into physics its probably one of the best things you can get at the moment doctor
4591871 yeah that probably sums it up but guess what i got both the location and the date right
4591872 i dont know who you are and how you got into my backyard but i want you out right now
4591873 im the doctor by the way mister newton and me and miss jones were just on our way out
4591874 but if you insist its called philosofiae naturalis principia mathematica but dont search for it mister newton dont go out and look for it
4591875 just remember its title because one day mister newton one day the principia will find you until then just be brilliant
4591876 you martha jones just help newton with one of the most fundamental discoveries from the world of physics
4591877 you cant understand how a woman seeing a man who has been separated from his wife rosetta getty for months can cause such a scandal its awful i cant tell you you wonder when its all going to stop
4591878 as mayor i have listened to the debate and the various comments and in particular i have reflected upon the financial aspects of this issue i have reviewed the financial implications and have formed the view that they should be reconsidered
4591879 the only mechanism for a council to reconsider an issue such as this is through a recission motion whilst i do not advocate for the use of recission motions once a decision is made there are circumstances which warrant the use of a circuit breaker and in my view this is one such occasion
4591880 there is general consensus and support from a vast majority of the community for the master plan and the only issue where there is significant division is in retention of 64 and 66 nelson street
4591881 i dont think there are many people who believe the reserve should remain as it is and the resolution of this issue will allow the council to get on with the project and deliver an outstanding facility for our community
4591882 mein name aleksander g ckelhorn aleksander mit ks und g ckelhorn g c k e l horn

4591886 wenn man ihnen das durchgehen l sst wird das ganze zu einer unendlichen geschichte
4591887 das hier ist kein krieg zwischen georgien und s dossetien sondern eine russische invasion in georgien
4591888 wir h tten dann zwar dem gegner schweren schaden zuf gen k nnen aber f r uns w re das einem selbstmord gleichgekommen deshalb kam diese option nicht in frage
4591889 die halten an kiosken und fordern die verk ufer auf ihnen etwas zu essen zu geben
4591890 nie zuvor hat es in so einem kurzen konflikt so viele opfer bei der presse gegeben
4591891 die gr te trag die ist was mit den s dosseten passiert ist
4591892 russland kontrolliert dort jetzt ein territorium auf dem keiner mehr lebt und das es mit den eigenen bombardements aus der luft selbst zerst rt hat
4591893 tenemos a lex luthor all y estoy muy seguro que el acertijo tambi n tiene su aparici n ed nigma tiene su momento
4591894 mostramos su origen pero no les mostramos el inicio sino que lo ponemos en una situaci n importante en su vida en la que todo lo que ten a ha sido perdido y quiere recuperarlo creo que a las audiencias les gustar conocer un nuevo personaje
4591895 we recommend that apple enhance this area long term to optionally eliminate itunes that is as a desktop application as a necessary component to access business applications and manage the device
4591896 i didnt know what to think about that so i thought about it for awhile after moving onto other things it didnt make sense to me until i started thinking about games
4591897 yeah but the market was going down too i dont want to participate in that market movement
4591898 i just went over to the table and said she was ready to go
4591899 you arent going home if she is ready to go oh well
4591900 so comes to me with our stuff from the table and says i aint no fucking babysitter
4591901 fuck her let her go home then we are having fun and you arent leaving
4591902 i know that bitch didnt come at me like that
4591903 one of the worst political books ever written corsi piles distortion upon innuendo to create a gigantic heap of right wing garbage with a seemingly endless parade of basic factual errors running through the text like rats corsis book is an embarrassment to the craft of journalism and any of the conservatives who have praised and promoted it should feel humiliated at how bad it truly is
4591904 now they botch a gimmie defining corsi as a nut while not putting attention on the charges he leveled
4591905 unlike most of the critics of the obama nation i have actually read the book from cover to cover it is a thoroughly well documented piece of first rate journalism are there mistakes in it show me a first edition that doesnt have some other than the bible but is it truthful does it add considerably to the publics knowledge of the front running candidate for the presidency do we know much more about obama than we would had we relied exclusively for our information from the new york times the los angeles times the washington post and the associated press i offer a resounding yes to all three of those questions i am privileged to call him my friend colleague and co worker i stand with jerry corsi today as he is viciously maligned by an attack media that would prefer to aim its potent artillery at a man who dared to do their job when they refused when they laid down when they sucked up when they failed to ask the tough questions when they took sides
4591906 one of the most vile smear peddlers of the 2004 election has found a new target we cannot afford to let corsi get away with the same dirty tricks that fooled so many people in 2004 we cant rely on the media to hold him accountable in fact the sheer brazenness of the lies is attracting even more coverage the media have shown that they arent going to stop him its up to you to spread the truth

4591911 after consulting with investigators it became clear to me that they are pursuing certain technical lines of investigation which could be severely compromised if too much information is divulged to the public at this stage

4591922 i wouldve had two cars out here up front my wifes and mine so i wouldve been in a bad situation

4592086 i really miss you but i dont want to say so in case it sparks a crisis in the balance of our relationship

4592090 estamos com in dita tranq ilidade na crise o impacto dos problemas na economia norte americana vai depender do efeito na china e na europa
4592091 hes provided good care to lots and lots of patients often paying for it out of his own pocket in the cases where hmos refused to reimburse it
4592092 we believe he didnt provide bad care to any patient we disagree with whats in the complaint
4592093 we are making a great game that harry potter fans will really enjoy we are evaluating the impact of the movie date change
4592094 what does that sucker know about it hes never been here anyway
4592095 when it was common to trade a rifle for a good hunting dog
4592096 people in these areas should take shelter stay in the lowest floor of your building away from windows
4592097 commodity costs have been volatile over the last several years and continue to remain at levels that are well above historical averages
4592098 the fda alone simply lacks the ability to serve as the sole guarantor of drug safety
4592099 the fda would be stripped of an essential source of information that the agency has consistently relied on when making its regulatory decisions and the american public would be deprived of a vital deterrent against pharmaceutical company misconduct
4592100 the law in the devices case had a pre emption provision
4592101 congress has never put a pre emption provision in the food and drug act
4592102 fda considers and approves specific labeling for a drug and the drug manufacturer is generally barred from making unilateral changes to the fda approved labeling
4592103 give me that old time religion give me that old time religion give me that old time religion its good enough for me
4592104 i know that before i can win your vote i have to win your respect
4592105 there is very little enthusiasm for mccain with people i network with
4592106 his voting record on social conservative issues for the most part is good
4592107 it is a matter of enthusiasm he is a hard guy to get enthusiastic about and why i just dont know
4592108 he hasnt done anything to offend hes just ignored them and they dont like to be ignored
4592109 i think if he wants to re create the intensity that has been within the base in the last two election cycles which i think personally you are going to need to win i think he has to make social issues a part of his political portfolio that he talks about
4592110 our belief is that during the remainder of the general election we will be able to make a compelling case as to why people of faith and christians in this country do have very compelling reasons to vote for and support john mccain
4592111 beyond the choice of his running mate sen mccains comments raise questions about the type of individuals he would appoint to other important positions like hhs secretary and even judgeships
4592112 as it becomes clearer and clearer that a barack obama administration would be a disaster the numbers will be there
4592113 i think it would be to his advantage to speak more to those kinds of voters and when i think he does that he always does very well
4592114 i think we will see him do more of that as we go through this year
4592115 and in the red corner from riverside ca weighing in at 40 000 live attendees for each of three nights at anaheim stadium plus an indeterminate number of radio and tv viewers harvest christian fellowship and the harvest crusade
4592116 and in the blue corner from lake forest ca weighing in at 5 000 live attendees including some of whom paid 2 000 to be there to snooze to the old cranky and crotchety john mccain or bask in the aura of the kind compassionate and caring obamessiah plus a live cable audience of millions and untold more in broadcast excerpts saddleback church and the civil form on compassion and leadership
4592117 saw a bunch of xs eating at this place ergo this must be a good place for x cuisine
4592118 derives its moral authority from a womans right to choose safe and legal abortion
4592119 a notable omission is the clintonian phrase safe legal and rare replaced by a more honest and modest goal of reducing unintended pregnancy through better health care family planning and comprehensive sex education sex education was not even mentioned in the old platform
4592120 the progressive pro life desire to see the platform commit to reducing abortions was subtly undercut this year the platform merely recognizes that sex ed family planning and good health care will have the effect of reducing the need for abortion
4592121 in all other areas the platform uses strong language of commitment the party strongly and unequivocally supports roe and strongly supports access to affordable family planning services
4592122 even the platforms support for pre and post natal care and income support for women who have children is properly framed as a right on its own and not as a means to reducing the need for abortion
4592123 the biggest disappointment the ppers pro life progressives acknowledged about the platform was that it did not moralize about abortion but jim wallis took solace in the belief that the plank makes room for people with moral convictions about abortion as if those of us who support the right to choose have no moral conviction that undergirds our respect for choice
4592124 in recent years the antiabortion movement successfully put the nitty gritty details of abortion procedures on public display increasing the belief that abortion is serious business and that some societal involvement is appropriate those who are pro choice have not convinced america that we support a public discussion of the moral dimensions of abortion
4592125 shit i put your iphone on the bumper of the suv
4592126 424 as the church expanded the twin city of became the primary center for church activities in asia theotokos

4592132 we had built the sets and designed costumes but we couldnt seem to find a sonic screwdriver anywhere as the play is about time travel we really needed the prop which is seen in doctor who shows
4592133 everyone at pontlliw players is over the moon with the prop now weve got everything in place we cant wait for the show to begin
4592134 as i write this russia is waging war on my country
4592135 you were given the choice between war and dishonor you chose dishonor and you will have war
4592136 the extent of the wreckage of georgia reaches far beyond that small country
4592137 how russia plans to behave in international affairs for decades to come
4592138 by hosting these poland is making itself a target this is 100 per cent certain it becomes a target for attack such targets are destroyed as a first priority
4592139 the deployment of new missile defence facilities in europe is aimed against the russian federation
4592140 oh right youre the guy from the youtube videos awesome i love those videos
4592141 we are trying to coordinate with anyone on the ground and at all levels
4592142 its the beginning of a process and we will have more of a sense of the movement of humanitarian supplies in the coming days
4592143 our resolution does not contain the way serbia sees the unilateral declaration of independence
4592144 the coup was illegal and illegitimate and we call for the immediate release of president abdallahi and his restoration as the legitimate president of mauritania
4592145 if the coup is not reversed we will stop aid that has been in the pipeline for much larger amounts in future years
4592146 i dont see how consumer spending turns around anytime before the second half of 2009
4592147 where are the new sources of funds coming from for the consumer clearly the earnings reports show that we are living in a discretionary versus nondiscretionary world
4592148 rouss rodents of unusual size dont worry they dont exist
4592149 ill grow a porn stache and wear a cubs hat
4592150 we didnt have much jasper worked from sunup to sundown and i kept house best i could but milton there was just a gleam in his eye he made you feel good about yourself
4592151 the lyrical content has gotten more in depth its about who we are as people and out personal lives things weve gone through in the past 12 months
4592152 all my inspirations get channeled through what feels right for the dance floor today
4592153 so there are some very modern elements to the album and its mixed and mastered the way a record needs to be now but again its a total concept album i wanted to make something like a pink floyd record where you put it on and you listen to the whole thing all the way through and it takes you on this crazy journey
4592154 i was surprised and disappointed that the worlds media immediately took the side of georgian president mikheil saakashvili last week
4592155 the truth is that in this case russian aggression actually made some sense
4592156 i thought twitter was a useless toy at first but now i see it has potential to be a great tool
4592157 if you have mastered the blogging paradigm have made your blog an authority and a reliable source of information commentary or news in your selected field s of interest it is about time to
4592158 propel propel propel your craft softly down liquid solution ecstatically ecstatically ecstatically ecstatically existence is simply illusion
4592159 one of the largest public works efforts in the world
4592160 the projects include coastal restoration efforts that will provide the coastal buffer we need to improve our hurricane protection levees already under construction and funds to advance hurricane protection efforts in every coastal parish in our state
4592161 we have always said that in order to keep louisiana safe we need both to strengthen the levees we have now and restore the wetlands and coastal areas that serve as our natural hurricane barriers
4592162 this is financially prudent in that future surpluses are uncertain and will allow the state to help keep the corps on schedule and continuing coastal development projects
4592163 this plan shows a substantial commitment to projects that will allow us to restore wetlands by using sediment that would otherwise have gone to waste
4592164 these projects will restore the mississippi rivers capacity to build land and allow us to take advantage of storm protection provided by our natural resources
4592165 the barrier islands act as a speed bump for storm surge and wave energy
4592166 louisiana loses the equivalent of 32 football fields worth of wetlands every day and that includes many of our barrier islands this leaves coastal communities vulnerable to the full wrath of hurricanes the new funding will help us rebuild those speed bumps and bring back our first line of defense against storms
4592167 it is time to start breaking ground and digging dirt on these projects
4592168 make a robust investment in science and technology to provide solutions to our coastal restoration and protection challenges
4592169 milton appel had unleashed an attack on zuckermans career that made macduffs assault on macbeth look almost lackadaisical
4592170 however despite recent losses the tamil tigers still hold considerable fighting ability to launch surprise counter attacks contrary to some military claims their core fighting formations are said to be still intact and they can easily adapt themselves to protracted guerrilla warfare
4592171 the principles of counterinsurgency are diverse but they could be summed up as methods of warfare used to draw a civilian populations political and personal allegiance away from a guerrilla force
4592172 both sides routinely exaggerate enemy casualties and underreport their own independent verification of the fighting is not possible because journalists are barred from the war zone
4592173 in a democratic society the theory is that if the political leadership is committed to war they present reasons the role of the media at that point is to present the relevant background and to offer a forum of debate that never happened 99 9 of the discussion excluded the option of a peaceful settlement
4592174 fighting terrorism is like being a goalkeeper you can make a hundred brilliant saves but the only shot that people remember is the one that gets past you
4592175 when far away we must make him believe we are near
4592176 it used to be conventional wisdom that people under 30 dont care about privacy
4592177 it turned out they definitely care about controlling their own data and in the end that is how beacon really pissed people off
4592178 it seemed like a promising technology at the time positioned to put facebook that much more at the head of the game
4592179 these sites have become much more sensitive to giving users control of their own information
4592180 we are just at the formative stage in the use of social networking as a promotional vehicles people will be more cautious but that wont stop the innovation
4592181 social networks now know they cant take peoples private information and make it public without asking for permission first
4592182 a lot of the startups think that using consumer data is a magic bullet for cash flow problems if the law and lawmakers begin to take online privacy violations more seriously these companies will have to rethink their strategies as they move forward
4592183 long term interests of jammu and kashmir dividing people in the name of religion can complicate these issues further which can also pose a threat to the unity and integrity of the country he cautioned let us resolve today to stand together to strengthen the unity and integrity of our country and to stand firm in our determination to build a new india of our dreams
4592184 turks and frogs is a quaint little bar in the west village that never fails to provide the setting for an enjoyable evening
4592185 but i was thinking especially about our new research center
4592186 well you were at the meeting when the board decided to spend 350 million for the center for research and technology
4592187 thats what i wanted to ask you about phil how in the world can we make billions of dollars in the future if people stop smoking
4592188 you must have dozed off at that point in the presentation the point is that were going to pay serious attention to peoples health concerns were going to take the health risk out of tobacco
4592189 were going to make tobacco a health product youve got to be kidding
4592190 not exactly were going to go one better were going to market our cigarettes as less risky than theyve ever been thats a lot easier than making smoking a health trip and it will work
4592191 by some measurement in some way using some pieces of technology and some set of marketing terms yes we can make tobacco that has less of a health risk
4592192 im getting tired of people blaming all these diseases and deaths on the nicotine in cigarettes it just isnt there isnt
4592193 right the nicotine doesnt kill you just makes you addicted so you hit on four thousand or so chemicals that give you cancer
4592194 so what are we going to do about it figure out a way to get the nicotine without getting the tar and all those other bad things as well
4592195 something like that you know theres always the skeptic who comes along and says if we get rid of a thousand of those bad chemicals its like falling out a 7 story building instead of a 10 story building
4592196 and its not that easy to get rid of even a dozen or two of them talk is cheap advertising sells research is credible i get it hey thanks for the info bro now give me some advice for facing the future okay
4592197 sure never underestimate the willingness of the public to smoke more or not quit if they think the health risks are down thats the power of nicotine

4592200 it is our task our responsibility to enlighten the east indies through liberal education
4592201 sesungguhnya tidak ada apa yang disebut politik etis di tanah jajahan karena tujuan politik kolonial ialah eksploitasi bangsa yang terbelakang walaupun tujuan yang sebenarnya sering disembunyikan di belakang kata kata indah
4592202 in the netherlands the vital issues of the ethical colonial policy seemed to be less concerned with humanitarian and moral principles than with financial arrangements between motherland dutch and colony dutch indies

4592210 the amount being paid to the music industry even though their games are entirely dependent on the content we own and control is far too small
4592211 respectful of how much weve done to bring new audiences into the market
4592212 i think his view was that warner music should be compensated the way they might for a performance on itunes
4592213 but this is an entirely different business that is very technically complex were going to favour those publishers that recognise and appreciate how much we can add value to their artists
4592214 were introducing a whole new group of artists to new audiences that is resulting in their itunes downloads being exponentially higher than they would otherwise be as well as new album sales and new merchandising opportunities

4592216 we heard a similar story quite often if a doctor retired or died or there was a merger or another practice took over the patients they patients would have difficulty getting their records back to take to another doctor
4592217 there were even stories of records being found in the rubbish bin in the doctors garage or even on the footpath
4592218 we found that all through our enquiry we would hear peoples stories and say what there were no rules or the rules would not accord with what most people would consider common sense
4592219 i think people wanted simplification and harmonisation in this area and thats what we have tried to deliver
4592220 we know the nhmrc was interested in us not making it more difficult to do research certainly i think they will be pleased with these recommendations and i think we have found a good balance between facilitating more research and respecting individuals privacy
4592221 upon request by your patient make available to another doctor a report of your findings and treatment

4592285 if the head of the land transportation office lto is really doing his job he does not have to seek permission to conduct a crackdown on illegally used 8 protocol plates of members of the house of representatives
4592286 anyone who causes abuse on the road should be apprehended no matter what plate number the vehicle bears we only have one law and that applies to all you mean you need permission from congress to do that
4592287 suansing is playing double talk he has never written or even talked to me about the number 8 plate recall by his agency worse he issues statements to the press that congressmens vehicles are abusive on the road
4592288 if he cannot perform his job it will be better for suansing to resign from his post and give it to someone who knows how to do his job

4592331 todays decision proves china cheats and that u s trade law enforcement is an important tool that will help level the playing field for u s workers by requiring chinese tire imports to be priced fairly
4592332 this case shows the importance of vigorous enforcement of our trade laws as a first line of defense against unfair trade practices that harm american industries and jobs
4592333 the itc vote of 5 1 reveals how egregious chinas import violations of fair trade rules really are
4592334 we are proud of fighting for trade fairness with titan tire and we believe american tire workers will now have a measure of future job security at least for those who make otr tires
4592335 union workers at the freeport plant are very excited about the outcome this trade enforcement action provides by shoring up job security in our craft building the large tires for agricultural and mining equipment is physically heavy and demanding but if fair trade laws are followed we can compete
4592336 as a pastor i believe in the separation of church and state but i dont believe we can separate religion from politics because ones faith determines ones worldview which informs ones decisions and determines how one would lead
4592337 the reason we are hosting this historic event is to stake out common ground for the common good
4592338 since announcing this event last month i have seen concerns expressed from two groups about this civil forum and my role in it
4592339 some secularists think i am going to make this a christian or religious litmus test for the presidency while many religious people assume i am going to wimp out and not ask about issues involving sanctity of life and the family including abortion stem cell research and traditional marriage
4592340 i will ask all the tough questions but this is a conversation not a confrontation and i am going to be civil in our discussion people know where i stand on the critical issues however this forum is not about me and what i believe but to give a place for america to hear the candidates hearts by going beyond moral issues and their virtues to also share their values and vision for leadership
4592341 although our economy has been weathering the downturn better than the nation in recent months both the state and the nation took a hit in july
4592342 it is important for us to continue to take matters into our own hands with our own solution to this national problem
4592343 in the past two weeks i announced 659 million in state funding for projects in 26 counties that will keep nearly 30 000 pennsylvanians working this investment will leverage more than 1 3 billion in matching private and public funding for a total of more than 1 9 billion pumped into our economy investments like this keep us primed for growth by investing in jobs and business expansion we have the opportunity to gain the needed momentum to carry us through the national economic downturn
4592344 our construction sector is strong although we have seen some job losses in recent months
4592345 many of the projects i announced in the past two weeks will require construction workers
4592346 in addition the 411 bridges in this years accelerated repair program will require enough concrete to build 16 000 homes which would be equal to a 60 percent increase in new home construction
4592347 that bridge work will demand enough steel to build four eiffel towers
4592348 these investments represent more than the physical restoration of pennsylvania we are restoring and strengthening the confidence of our businesses workers and citizens to let them know that they are not alone in this difficult national economy and that state government is doing its part to create opportunities for economic success right now and for the future

4592358 this is the first picture of a clay sized particle on mars and the size agrees with predictions from the colors seen in sunsets on the red planet
4592359 taking this image required the highest resolution microscope operated off earth and a specially designed substrate to hold the martian dust
4592360 we always knew it was going to be technically very challenging to image particles this small
4592361 im delighted that this microscope is producing images that will help us understand mars at the highest detail ever
4592362 this is proof of the microscopes potential we are now ready to start doing scientific experiments that will add a new dimension to measurements being made by other phoenix lander instruments

4592432 jag kommer nog inte kunna ligga med jake p ett tag tror jag r nog helt trasig i stj rten ocks och

4592434 f rs k inte jake det d r var inte mitt fel
4592435 this and that are possible for you these other things are not
4592436 he said you were weird and you wouldnt leave him alone and you ring him all the time and you piss him off so he ignores you thats what he said actually
4592437 ive always been a big fan of putting into the market on a regular basis regardless of what is happening in the overall market
4592438 if ive learned anything in the more than a quarter of a century of following the markets it is this fact buying stocks when you know you should i e during sharp down moves is really difficult our heads says we should after all substantial market downturns create the best values
4592439 but our emotions usually take control thus making it very difficult to pull the trigger and put money into the market when stocks are falling
4592440 thats why ive always been a big fan of 401 k plans with these investment vehicles investment programs are put on autopilot with dollars being put into the market on a regular basis usually each paycheck regardless of what is happening in the overall market
4592441 fortunately investors can duplicate the autopilot feature of 401 k plans with their drip investments by taking advantage of automatic monthly investment features provided by most drips
4592442 under this feature investors can set up automatic investments via electronic debit of their bank accounts each month for investors who use this feature drip plans usually reward them with a number of benefits
4592443 for example it is not unusual for a firm to waive the minimum initial investment amount if an investor is willing to agree to automatic monthly investments via electronic debit from their bank account
4592444 however disney will waive this amount if an investor agrees to automatic monthly investment of at least 100 the ability to invest smaller amounts via electronic debit increases the accessibility of many drip plans
4592445 firms usually charge a lower fee on shares purchased with automatic monthly investment returning to our disney example the firm charges drip participants a fee of 5 for shares purchased with a check however shares purchased via automatic monthly investment are charged a fee of just 1
4592446 true if you choose to invest via automatic monthly investment you are committed to making regular monthly investments however your requirement usually extends only until you invest the amount that equals the minimum initial investment
4592447 for example if you choose to make automatic monthly investments in the disney plan you need to make those automatic investments until you reach disneys minimum initial investment amount of 1 000 that would mean a minimum of 10 monthly investments of 100 each
4592448 the following autopilot drip portfolio contains 10 quality stocks all of these companies permit initial purchases directly and all reduce their minimum initial investment amount if an investor agrees to automatic monthly investment via electronic debit of a bank account
4592449 i seen medical supplies oxygen and stuff being delivered and it looked like she had a hospital bed on her truck the other day i think its for the sick person or her husband coming home
4592450 youve lived here all your life and you dont know columbia has an airport
4592451 were 12 miles out of town were out of sight out of mind
4592452 were in a business where its all about customer service
4592453 ive just always had great respect for her and it was neat to meet her in person
4592454 sometimes people tell us theyre coming sometimes people just show up so we meet them greet them and try to accommodate them
4592455 avionics encompasses all of the navigational and communication systems in the airplane
4592456 but honest to god this is a national airport out here
4592457 a taco salad ok itll be ready in about 10 minutes
4592458 you dont make it up theres no way you can make it up
4592459 ive met a lot of nice people theyre good to me my regulars are my regulars
4592460 every time i come there they have a car waiting for us and you can drive that car right up to your plane
4592461 the cost of the fuel is kind of like driving a big suv but youre getting there a little faster
4592462 being able to do more with key guys thats the biggest advantage
4592463 we process more than 300 000 pieces of outgoing mail every day outgoing is mail to locations outside the mid missouri area as well as through the country and to other parts of the world we also process 600 000 to 800 000 pieces of mail for this area
4592464 the facility handles a wide variety of shipments including domestic and international parcels
4592465 but well still continue to provide pickup and delivery services in that area
4592466 this is one part of dhls comprehensive u s restructure plan which involves optimizing its air network to reduce costs and increase efficiencies
4592467 we are in conversations now with ups on the specifics of our operational plan
4592468 we will not be releasing the specifics of an agreement until a final agreement is signed
4592469 when he took off he blew away four signs the city had to pay for that
4592470 people had one and two years of experience they were learning how to talk with a plane we each came in with at least 20 years
4592471 youve got a group of guys who are homesteading if you want to call it that
4592472 if you come into my backyard i want to know about it
4592473 you follow him you follow him thats what this job is
4592474 all it takes is one little cessna to run into a commercial airplane
4592475 a lot of pilots think that all we have up here are my contact lenses these binoculars and pilot reports
4592476 if this tower went away to no tower a lot of businesses wont fly into an uncontrolled airport
4592477 for a corporate pilot the briefing may be very short
4592478 but we are part of a bigger team and being part of that bigger team there are times that we help other facilities
4592479 and we believe in getting the job done and doing it right
4592480 and those of us who know about it see it as a promising turn of events
4592481 they want to know how they can get here and service their business its very important that we have a good answer for them and something that doesnt require a lengthy drive
4592482 after one can it seemed to turn the young individual into one with more of the type of profile you would expect to see with someone with cardiovascular disease
4592483 people who already have existing cardiovascular disease may want to talk to their physician before they drink red bull in future
4592484 maybe theres something quirky about the effect of the combination of the two in the drink which is causing this reaction this is what we need to look at next
4592485 the study does not show effects which would go beyond that of drinking a cup of coffee therefore the reported results were to be expected and lie within the normal physiological range
4592486 another health scare and tomorrows will be aubergines advocaat avocados frank upton solihull
4592487 a contemporary term that encompasses any measure beyond simple termination of a discriminatory practice which permits the consideration of race national origin sex and disability along with other criteria and which is adopted to provide opportunities to a class of qualified individuals who have either historically or actually been denied those opportunities and to prevent the reoccurrence of discrimination in the future
4592488 i am a strong supporter of affirmative action when properly structured so that it is not a quota but it is acknowledging and taking into account some of the hardships and difficulties that communities of color may have experienced continue to experience and it also speaks to the value of diversity in all walks of american life
4592489 how will the democratic candidate deal with potentially divisive ballot initiatives calling for an end to affirmative action
4592490 the next test of barack obamas postracial persona may come from some unlikely places arizona colorado missouri nebraska and oklahoma thats where ward connerly the countrys most innovative and successful opponent of affirmative action over the past decade is launching an effort to get an initiative on the ballots that would prohibit public institutions from considering race sex or ethnicity in areas such as hiring and college admissions
4592491 he can replace alex hleb in the build up of the game in the creation of the chances and he is very versatile
4592492 he is also very young the same age as cesc fabregas we now have a very young generation which can develop together
4592493 for me he is a player who has a good engine good technique and vision he can play the final ball which we like here he has the technical level to go into any combination and is very mobile we believe he has the ingredients to fit into our game
4592494 it is always very nice in pre season and everyone wants to respect each other
4592495 when it comes to points it becomes a bit different
4592496 it is like when you go to church on a sunday the priest says everyone has to be respectful and generous but when you come out of the church everyone is not generous and respectful
4592497 it would be a fantastic choice if he made john terry captain
4592498 he is captain of chelsea and i think he must again captain england he helps the manager and the players by saying the right things on and off the field
4592499 maybe this is the season for anelka he has played well in the friendlies has shown good speed and has switched position very well
4592500 i need to work more with him to get the best out of him i need to help him in the head because he has some good qualities

4592505 i dont see how consumer spending turns around anytime before the second half of 2009
4592506 where are the new sources of funds coming from for the consumer clearly the earnings reports show that we are living in a discretionary versus nondiscretionary world

4592591 well phase i of the riaas misguided pursuit of an innocent disabled oregon woman atlantic v andersen has finally drawn to a close as the riaa was forced to pay ms andersen 107 951 representing the amount of her attorneys fee judgment plus interest but as some have pointed out reimbursement for legal fees doesnt compensate ms andersen for the other damages shes sustained and thats where phase ii comes in andersen v atlantic there the shoe is on the other foot and tanya is one doing the hunting as she pursues the record companies and their running dogs for malicious prosecution should be interesting
4592592 it was there from the first lap the first turn
4592593 we tried some things during practice that didnt work at all
4592594 so we went back to where we were and i think thats one of the best qualifying cars ive ever had it was a heck of a lap
4592595 im very proud of everybody at red bull racing and toyota
4592596 we picked up speed from practice but i just knew in the car it wasnt the fastest lap
4592597 and i think for that red bull team and brian this has been a track that fits their style hell be ever more of a threat come race time
4592598 its the team to beat in our sport for the last several years
4592599 to lay that lap down in practice and back it up in qualifying thats a really good feeling
4592600 really unbelievable i wish we could take that and apply it to every week but its not that easy
4592601 but anytime you can see progress feel progress patience comes easier
4592602 i want you to know to whom to blame in this conflict it is mr saakashvili who started this war and mr saakashvili who is aggressor and my people were killed and bombed by him and over 2 000 people were killed in one day

4592606 yes i know i know you dont want to hear that
4592607 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4592608 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4592609 when jeff robinov explained the rationale behind moving the release date of harry potter and the half blood prince to july 2009 it was immediately apparent that this offered us the potential to reach the widest possible audience i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of david yates and our incomparable cast i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4592610 it has been a joy to work on harry potter and the half blood prince dan rupert and emma and all our returning young cast continue to blossom and our new cast members bring fresh color and life to hogwarts even as we put the finishing touches on this latest film we are already beginning preparations on the final two films we start filming in february and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve
4592611 hold up until summer when all the kids are out of make more money
4592612 but the big ones the dumbledore storyline the snape storyline were always there because you the series is built around those
4592613 the picture is completely absolutely 100 percent on schedule on time there were no delays ive seen the movie it is fabulous we would have been perfectly able to have it out in november
4592614 well we had to delay it because yates screwed up again
4592615 the editors washedout all of the make up artists work
4592616 the cg artists crashed a hard drive and we had to start all over
4592617 but the big ones the dumbledore storyline the snape storyline were always there because you the series is built around those

4592629 honest and open dialogue about the offense this film perpetrates on them
4592630 ive heard interviews of ben stiller in the last several days and he dismisses the controversy surrounding the movie stiller said that we dont understand that the movie is making fun of actors and they didnt intend to offend people with disabilities
4592631 the portrayal of simple jack is not funny and the hate speech in the movie is not funny
4592632 personally meet with people with disabilities and their families so he can learn first hand about why what he dreamworks and paramount have done and are doing is so offensive
4592633 anyone who doesnt think this movie will influence the attitudes and behavior of young people towards people with disabilities hasnt been in a high school or around young kids recently as soon as they leave the theater kids are quoting movie lines and acting out scenes as well as the actors did they wont care that this movie is meant to be a parody of hollywoods excesses
4592634 these words and images get in the way of my right to live with dignity in the community the message of this movie is that it is acceptable to make fun of people like me
4592635 the crowded banks of the sinuous chao phraya river were once considered the heart of bangkok but these days the river is largely peripheral for everyone but tourists that is a shame because river life in bangkok is still vibrant

4592639 one of the great summer pleasures in moscow is a leisurely walk along the citys leafy boulevards the pedestrian friendly boulevard ring built where the citys 16th century fortifications once stood is part of the citys lore immortalized in art literature and film
4592640 a brisk walk around the ring takes about an hour and a half and it is like a walk through moscows history
4592641 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century

4592643 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4592644 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4592645 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points

4592648 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4592667 there was absolutely no scene it was really underground oriented either it was for military personnel or it was for people who lived a rough lifestyle like bikers or prisoners
4592668 i try to create a friendly environment everybodys used to seeing tattoo shops where the sign is half broken and the neon makes breaking sounds and the people walk in normal and then they come out serial killers
4592669 right now theres a huge trend of females the so called soccer moms are getting tattooed so basically the people with the biggest preconceptions about tattooing have now made a choice that its acceptable to go out and get it done
4592670 i wasnt looking to set the world on fire with a tattoo shop
4592671 its my passion that was going to be more of my clubhouse i wanted a place where i could have a shop i can hang out and get tattooed if i want and hang out with my friends
4592672 im just trying to slow it down a little bit im still pretty young and im pretty heavily covered ive got two legs and a neck left so im trying to take my time a little bit
4592673 and in my ongoing quest to tattoo the world what better way to do it than to put a shop in the middle of sin city
4592674 one of the funny things my daughter said the other day was i was driving and of course i wasnt driving fast enough for the guy who wanted to get to the red light first
4592675 im lucky in that ive achieved what ive achieved im kind of satisfied with my life so far and i think that i have more to offer my daughter because ive lived for a very long time i really admire younger mothers a lot of my friends are younger mothers because im so much older but i think i wouldnt have been as good a mother as i am now if id done this in my 20s
4592676 we anticipate completing the m resort on time and on budget and are excited to debut the new property in march 2009
4592677 from its inception our goal was to build a resort that offers customers a unique and compelling entertainment and retail experience
4592678 mgm is half of the las vegas strip so its hard to avoid
4592679 although the main vegas numbers were dreadful mgm is probably the barometer that everyone should be using
4592680 guests continued to visit the companys resorts in high numbers but at lower room rates and current economic conditions led to lower visitor spending mgm said
4592681 gaming revenues were impacted slightly more than non gaming revenues
4592682 the high end has been so far less affected by the economy said forst
4592683 its the lower end properties circus excalibur that have been facing more difficult times than bellagio and mandalay bay
4592684 we are still in the early stages of realizing the potential of this resort chief executive officer
4592685 we have taken several steps to improve our operating performance over the past several months
4592686 our new happy hour is just one way to give back to our customers during a tough economy
4592687 were bucking the trend of raising prices at a time when costs seem to be spiking everywhere else from the pump to the grocery aisle
4592688 the street has become overly negative on boyd gaming and management has made the appropriate decision to protect and reinforce the underlying shareholder value of the core portfolio
4592689 maybe all of this stuff was all meant to be
4592690 my dad always joked that he wanted to be cremated and have his ashes scattered over the las vegas strip
4592691 he saw me he got excited and then the next day he gave up
4592692 ill bring a tape and ill just argue with the tape
4592693 he gave her 100 percent billing brown told her people will say she must be really good and theyll come in to find out
4592694 we must not be hampered by yesterday s myths in concentrating on today s needs
4592695 you cant run a business or anything else on a theory

4592701 we are especially proud of being recognized among our peers particularly in the area of community service
4592702 journal broadcast group has a long and proud history of commitment to the communities we serve and events like these that our employees put together show how well we all can come together to help our neighbors
4592703 i love that im curvy but im on this major kick to try and lose weight especially in my butt
4592704 im just so over it when youre posing on the red carpet and the paparazzi shout turn around turn around it gets a little offensive
4592705 ive seen magazines where plastic surgeons are saying if you want a butt like this it has to be fake
4592706 im just like dude have you ever seen an armenian girl before
4592707 reminds me of cottage cheese inside a big trash bag
4592708 she called and apologized and i accepted her apology she said she was joking i kind of laugh it off like you know ive never denied having cellulite everyones entitled to their own opinion if she thinks my butt looks like that i dont really care
4592709 the first law of dietetics seems to be if it tastes good its bad for you
4592710 exposed some weaknesses in the way this operation was conducted
4592711 you can never train for every specific circumstance that will come up on the battlefield
4592712 even on a mission like this when error has occurred there is also great bravery and gallantry going on at the same time
4592713 the reality is that there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off of a presidential campaign we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means necessary
4592714 im saying theres been this fictionalized life story put out by obama in his autobiography that has been magnified during the campaign and the truth is dramatically different in many instances from what obama represents
4592715 if the fundamental smear of unfit for command was that john kerry was no war hero the insinuation of mr corsis latest is that mr obama is a closet muslim and militant black activist drug user
4592716 it will spur debate and i think sen obama should get used to a very critical examination of his history and his tenure in the u s senate the same thing is also going to happen to sen mccain
4592717 just as unfit for command contains false attacks on sen john kerrys military service the obama nation similarly contains numerous falsehoods about sen barack obama
4592718 several of the books accusations are unsubstantiated misleading or inaccurate
4592719 russian forces need to leave georgia at once this is no longer 1968
4592720 not only those people who perpetrated this but those who failed to stop it
4592721 the deployment of new anti missile forces has as its aim the russian federation
4592722 therefore any fairy tales about deterring other states fairy tales that with the help of this system we will deter some sort of rogue states no longer work
4592723 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4592724 we very much want the six point plan to be implemented very promptly so that russian troops are no longer in georgia outside abkhazia and south ossetia

4592736 my understanding is the first production unit of the w76 has been diamond stamped here within the past couple of week
4592737 we had a technical issue that required a lot of support from other sites as well as drawing on a lot of expertise here at y 12
4592738 it involved reconstitution of an old process its quite challenging to reconstitute something you havent done in awhile
4592739 we are pleased that weve been able to resolve these issues but i think one should not underestimate the challenge of stopping a production process and then many years later trying to resume it thats been tough

4592762 august is a seasonally low period but today it was the strengthening u s dollar and the drop in the oil price all three factors contributed to gold breaking down technically
4592763 things are kind of all coming to a head led by the u s recession how deep the housing slowdown is going to go and how bad this credit things going to get so everybodys nervous
4592764 i dont see how consumer spending turns around anytime before the second half of 2009
4592765 where are the new sources of funds coming from for the consumer clearly the earnings reports show that we are living in a discretionary versus nondiscretionary world
4592766 so with the canadian dollar being stronger that lowered revenue
4592767 if we proceed with gentilly it is something that we can live with financially
4592768 the dollar is on fire again so thats causing people to re evaluate everything
4592769 it means oil prices could fall dramatically we could see prices get to double digits if this continues
4592770 theyre basically saying we could have an oil glut because demand is slowing
4592771 its obvious that high prices do slow down demand and the market works
4592772 under the partial clinical hold patients currently enrolled in mgcd0103 clinical trials who are confirmed to have no signs or symptoms of pericarditis or pericardial effusion may continue in their respective studies

4592774 were looking for signals that the government understands it has problems which are important problems but not life threatening
4592775 its the equivalent of the government of the u s coming in and taking a chunk of your 401k
4592776 we do not compete on price or promotion regardless of macroeconomic conditions although it may be both easy and tempting to drive short term sales with pricing and promotional efforts
4592777 we will not sacrifice this investment and growth plan for short term results
4592778 we see further aspirational positioning of the abercrombie brands despite weak retail sales trends and expect this brand strategy to pay back in second half
4592779 gold and oil seem to have locked together pretty much when oil comes down gold seems to come down
4592780 the near term is still going to look pretty challenging
4592781 but as you look further out this correction in commodity prices is decreasing inflation risks which takes the interest rate risks away for investors and gives the economies and the financial system more time to heal and ultimately a stronger rebound in the economy when it comes rather than short circuiting it with inflation fears and rate hikes that risk coming out is significant
4592782 geopolitical concerns and the realization that global slowdown concerns are behind the slump in commodities are acting as an offset of sorts that is restraining buying interest at this juncture
4592783 the softening economic situation has led to a further slowdown in oil demand growth
4592784 falling commodity prices and a stronger dollar have supported the market but the mood on a summer friday is cautious
4592785 as for the markets equity investors who are actually looking into the future should be buoyed by this report and with oil continuing to collapse the stars are starting to align at least for next year
4592786 all of the sudden it seems like the bottom fell out
4592787 its very difficult to make a bullish argument for gold
4592788 theres just too many factors going against it at this point for traders to get really enthused about it
4592789 you can almost call it quits for the bull market
4592790 as we move out of the summer months gold could recoup and move above 900 again but its going to be difficult
4592791 this is a very steep discount and now is probably a safe time to get in at a lower price than just a couple of weeks ago
4592792 im affected by the price of gas right now so im not in the market for gold
4592793 the data seems to have had a pretty profound impact on the canadian dollar the currency is really rallying in stark contrast to the trend weve seen over the last few weeks
4592794 i have to say im a little bit surprised that its managed to completely outweigh the softness in commodity prices but it simply seems that some days commodity prices dont win
4592795 todays report is marginally encouraging to us but we think it is not plausible that canadas manufacturing sector can grow sustainably with u s domestic demand contracting canadian domestic demand weakening and the cad canadian dollar still relatively strong
4592796 you have a moderate rally in the u s and canada is tracking that but its underperforming on the strong canadian economic data

4592808 i see two of my teammates here tonight damon benning and tony veland
4592809 they saw me come in as a young 17 year old from florida we all remember those early two a day fall practices dont we guys thats when tony and i were battling it out for the starting quarterback job
4592810 you have to realize coming to nebraska was the first time i ever left home
4592811 the farthest north id ever been was southern alabama so that was a long haul for me let me tell you there were some nights where i got real homesick and there was a time i was about to leave wasnt i

4592816 lewis even bragged before the game that the option would be useless against the team speed of miami and for three quarters it was
4592817 but when frazier re entered in the fourth quarter miami couldnt stop him
4592818 without her i would not be here i am not the easiest guy to get along with she keeps me on the straight and narrow and thats just what i need
4592819 i firmly believe tommie frazier would have been the first and only successful option quarterback in the pros now i guess we will have to see the modified version when tebow goes pro
4592820 all of my uncles and three older brothers who beat me up all the time

4592859 theres clear evidence that the u s economic slump is dragging down canadas economy
4592860 the commodities pullback will unwind some of the gains that weve seen in the terms of trade that have supported income and wealth creation in the country
4592861 its not a great picture for the second half of this year
4592862 i wouldnt be surprised if we retest the market lows
4592863 weve been surprised the market lows havent been greater than they have been given the environment that were in
4592864 our view is that we are unlikely near the bottom yet

4592866 how did they know that they were going to drop bombs on gori and not the capital

4592873 you may eat indeed of all the trees in the garden 2 17 nevertheless of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you are not to eat for on the day you eat of it you shall most surely die
4592874 did god really say you were not to eat from any of the trees in the garden
4592875 we may eat the fruit of the trees in the garden
4592876 but of the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden god said you must not eat it nor touch it under pain of death
4592877 god knows in fact that on the day you eat it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods knowing good and evil
4592878 your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods knowing good and evil
4592879 i was afraid because i was naked so i hid
4592880 have you been eating of the tree i forbade you to eat
4592881 it was the woman you put with me she gave me the fruit and i ate it
4592882 on the day you eat of it you shall most surely die
4592883 no you will not die god knows in fact that on the day you eat it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods knowing good and evil
4592884 see the man has become like one of us with his knowledge of good and evil he must not be allowed to stretch his hand out next and pick from the tree of life also and eat some and live forever
4592885 on the day you eat of it you shall most surely die
4592886 you must not behave as they do in egypt where once you lived you must not behave as they do in canaan where i am taking you you must not follow their laws

4592966 i could see from the bit of flint sticking out of the ground that it was actually a stone lined cisk
4592967 the cisk was on quite a popular path and people had been sitting on it and walking over it and had not realised they were inches away from an ancient skeleton

4593004 how much more imagining hypothetical lying or just plain lying is obama capable of doing
4593005 still obama has yet to answer questions whether he ever dealt drugs or if he stopped using marijuana and cocaine completely in college or whether his drug usage extended into his law school days or beyond did obama ever use drugs in his days as a community organizer in chicago or when he was a state senator from illinois how about in the u s senate
4593006 obama had to know that running for political office even state office would be much more difficult to do if voters suspected he was a muslim
4593007 yet once obama became a member of trinity he had proof he was a christian as he professed to be
4593008 obama mentions in passing that in 1984 he had just graduated from college and was working as a community organizer out of the harlem campus of the city college of new york this is a job obama does not mention in his autobiography dreams from my father

4593066 acho que o principal motivo da vit ria foi o ataque que foi muito bem atacamos com determina o com for a com ritmo e isso foi muito bom a defesa foi bem tamb m mas ofensivamente fomos melhores

4593070 heres a few aspects of the bianca ad that might be of interest
4593071 we need to go back to jamaica it wasnt the same not being with you
4593072 linn smashing a hamster with a brick and pouring it into a hole in the ground
4593073 grilled and black around its mouth and a bit slack when i found him
4593074 ashes to ashes dust to dust if the trip goes through gr nmo youll still never rust
4593075 is there anything we can do to get it back on its track ourselves
4593076 yep the toilet overflowed its all over the floor in the hallway too
4593077 those are words that ring in the american national anthem on american licence plates in the american declaration of independence
4593078 america must become energy independent and ethanol is one step in that process
4593079 corn based ethanol is going to be around for a long time its the foundation of what we are doing with ethanol
4593080 by 2030 well have a national average of corn yield of 300 bushels to the acre double what we have now monsanto stands behind that pioneer says the same thing and so does syngenta so it has to be right its the only thing those three companies agree on
4593081 our ethanol per acre is growing so we can produce more ethanol from fewer bushels of corn
4593082 corn ethanol is the ugly baby with a bright future
4593083 last year the use of fuel was up but the use of gasoline was down and for the first time in 30 years we imported less oil in the united states than we did the previous year
4593084 i have never seen the kind of progress in cellulosic ethanol that we are seeing today i have never seen the kind of investment by private industry and academia there is a tremendous amount of pressure in the country to move this forward and it is definitely having the best chance it has ever had
4593085 we are the freedom fighters in this battle were fighting big dollars big press machines but we got faith we got spirit we got the truth
4593086 according to the independent data the fuel price benefits to households far outweigh the food costs associated with biofuels and the epa came to the only conclusion the facts would permit a complete rejection of the texas request not only did the epa summarily deny the request they set a very high threshold a very strict precedent for future states to wave the rfs
4593087 we are underdogs but we keep going and we keep winning we have fueled a revolution to make gasoline the alternative fuel
4593088 are the biggest single countries that provide a challenge to the u s
4593089 i would say they are closely matched in terms of capability and programming to be able to induce an attack against the u s through the internet
4593090 this has been a very very powerful insight and we are learning who the botnets are and who are being told to attack and where those servers are and who is behind it
4593091 i think because we have more people who are able to utilize more equipment more operations more connectivity we are less vulnerable to this kind of attack but we are not immune
4593092 this is tremendous news the fact 10 member unions have signalled their intention to tender for the 2015 and 2019 tournaments reflects the growing global prestige of the rugby world cup
4593093 five of the six irb regions are represented with italy jamaica and russia signalling an interest to tender for a rugby world cup for the first time
4593094 i heard that jay sorta said something about me at the wimbeldon tennis match
4593095 what people dont know about jay is jay is probably the most witty rapper that ever walked the face of the earth
4593096 hes witty hes clever his metaphors will be sitting right next to you and then hit you in the face so hard that you dont know what happened thats the type of rapper jay is i was molded by that part of him and added that to my own persona and my own marksmanship as an emcee
4593097 a legend man i respect his music but that doesnt really mean i have to respect him if hes disrespecting me the jay that was talking about me at wimbeldon under his breath or says anything about me is the jay that ill go at and thats just it jay the rap artist jay the legend jay from marcy projects that hustler turned dope artist turned probably best lyricist that ever lived i have respect for im not gonna add wood to a fire thats already burning out
4593098 well i dont know if he said shit about me so i respect jay z
4593099 the greatest mistake you can make in life is to be continually fearing you will make one
4593100 i am pleased that hope is still alive for the people of florida to choose lower property taxes our people and business owners need tax relief and florida s economy would benefit from the boost it would receive from cutting taxes

4593117 what authority authorizes this in the ruby world me and im right
4593118 since im a java consultant i have a lot of work to do
4593119 holy writers who employed statements and various images and analogies of sacred scripture to illustrate and to confirm the doctrine of the assumption
4593120 theologians and preachers have been rather free in their use of expressions taken from sacred scripture to explain their belief in the assumption
4593121 was exempted from the fourfold curse that had been laid upon eve
4593122 in wonderful accord with those divine truths given us in holy scripture
4593123 the virgin is immortal he who dwelt in her transported her to the regions of her assumption
4593124 st juvenal bishop of jerusalem at the council of chalcedon 451 made known to the emperor marcian and pulcheria who wished to possess the body of the mother of god that mary died in the presence of all the apostles but that her tomb when opened upon the request of st thomas was found empty wherefrom the apostles concluded that the body was taken up to heaven
4593125 let them search the scriptures they will not find marys death they will not find whether she died or did not die they will not find whether she was buried or was not buried more than that john journeyed to asia yet nowhere do we read that he took the holy virgin with him rather scripture is absolutely silent on marys earthly end because of the extraordinary nature of the prodigy in order not to shock the minds of men neither do i maintain stoutly that she died
4593126 he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities
4593127 ought not christ to have suffered these things and so to enter into his glory
4593128 theres a plan on morrish road and it has been approved from bristol to i 69 looking to do retail development and with the plan there was a three lane road up there
4593129 i know theyve been studying it lane reductions will decrease long term maintenance cost reducing lanes for sure saves on cost
4593130 yeah ok but with this food crisis i think we should be putting food in our bellies instead of in my twat i would feel guilty
4593131 oh thatll go over well with the kids they dont do peppers remember
4593132 ill figure out something to do with it without peppers
4593133 and if i dont figure something out we might end up doing something fun with it after all
4593134 its hot enough out there to fry an egg on the sidewalk
4593135 i cant believe he did it this is amazing im so happy i can only jump up and down
4593136 the first thing i thought of was my parents and my coach
4593137 we are proud descendants of the great ghengis khan and tuvshee proved the strength of mongolians in the olympics
4593138 it is so exciting that our mongolian flag was raised in beijing and tuvshee won in the judo competition
4593139 me and several of my friends have bought mongolian vodka to celebrate this wonderful news it is going to be a very exciting night
4593140 right after the june 29 election we were in central square protesting election results and throwing stones against policemen and interior troops this time we are all here to cheer and support our athletes participating in beijing olympics
4593141 its very exciting its like an indiana jones adventure its searching for a lost under water tomb
4593142 our objective is to find and protect the wreck because they are in danger of being found by people who dont have the know how and the same intention and preoccupation that we have
4593143 the siding was the first to go then they took the fence then they broke in and took everything else
4593144 it about doesnt make sense to put the family out
4593145 once people are gone youre gonna lose the house in this neighborhood
4593146 no one has much sympathy for these banks that made subprime loans
4593147 and in some cities like cleveland judges arent letting them sit on the properties theyre ordering them to tear them down or sell them
4593148 it doesnt make sense in some neighborhoods to keep paying costs and costs
4593149 it can make more financial sense to give it away

4593157 the solution should take into consideration the uneasiness of the international community as well as protecting irans legitimate rights within the scope of the treaty on the non proliferation of nuclear weapons

4593367 he preys on at least he did the people who believed in him
4593368 thanks to the christian crazies who were and are so influential in this country america has criminalized more sexual conduct than any other western nation
4593369 there is nothing injurious to sexuality its good and pleasant not an evil children exposed to it are simply not injured
4593370 do i have to worry about whats happening with my kids i have to try to do something
4593371 they have scars they say will never go away theyre frightened
4593372 its clear mr kilpatrick knew who detective white was he specifically called him by name
4593373 his purpose for going out there is subject to question
4593374 he grabbed me with both hands around my shoulders and he threw me he threw me into investigator kinney
4593375 when they get to his house they know its not his house
4593376 at that point its over there is no interference with a government officer
4593377 the next thing i know he came out the door and he grabbed brian
4593378 he was cursing and telling us to get off the property get off my property get these people off my property i mean he was just screaming yelling and i was just standing there in disbelief because i couldnt believe mr mayor would do something like that
4593379 weve been very careful not to litigate this in the press
4593380 we believe it was isolated brief and on point with our theory of the case
4593381 very strong very direct the defense is just swinging wild
4593382 the bottom line is they were assaulted while doing their job
4593383 when there are events with different people there are going to be some differences unless its rehearsed
4593384 how did you manage to find a creature that has eluded modern technology and civilization for centuries
4593385 the fda alone simply lacks the ability to serve as the sole guarantor of drug safety
4593386 the fda would be stripped of an essential source of information that the agency has consistently relied on when making its regulatory decisions and the american public would be deprived of a vital deterrent against pharmaceutical company misconduct
4593387 the law in the devices case had a pre emption provision
4593388 congress has never put a pre emption provision in the food and drug act
4593389 fda considers and approves specific labeling for a drug and the drug manufacturer is generally barred from making unilateral changes to the fda approved labeling
4593390 even if the fda is doing the best it can it simply cant see the future clearly enough to pre empt manufacturers from litigation
4593391 the court system represents one of the key defense mechanisms that individuals have if a manufacturer has not made the risks of a product clear to the public
4593392 the challenge we have is that for approximately five years the plan which is a very bad plan but is the only plan that nasa and the administration and congress have approved is to be dependent on the russian soyuz vehicle to get people to and from the international space station
4593393 and so now with the political realities with russia invading georgia we have a new wrinkle thrown in
4593394 the waiver is required because under u s law any country that provides weapons or nuclear capabilities to countries like iran north korea and syria is prohibited from getting american technology or entering into any contract for american technology
4593395 it would be illegal for nasa unless they had a waiver to actually contract to use the soyuz to get to and from the space station
4593396 but that was before the hostilities in georgia my guess is that in the senate the attitude is going to be much less friendly toward cooperation with the russians
4593397 with the aggressiveness of russia in georgia i think its dead on arrival
4593398 this tension with the newly energized and resurgent russia being run by a man that fancies himself as the czar of russia vladimir putin is now going to cause a very serious problem in our american space program
4593399 we feel that while its possible that government to government issues could have an impact on our relationship we havent really picked up any word or any feedback from the hill that thats what will happen
4593400 the administrations lack of contingency planning and its penny wise pound foolish budgeting for nasa have put the nation in the position where we dont really have a good alternative to depending on russia for the next seven years unless the nation is prepared to start providing significant additional funding to nasa
4593401 the claim could be supported that next to pope burns is the greatest eighteenth century master of these literary types
4593402 anyone who is too lazy to master the comparatively small glossary necessary to understand chaucer deserves to be shut out from the reading of good books forever

4593404 large numbers of scots were penetrating england itself compromising its identity winning access to its riches and cutting out english men
4593405 when i got the e mail i thought it was a brilliant idea which only tilda could have come up with it reminded me of the old hollywood musicals when somebody would say lets just put on a show lets just do it right here
4593406 when you go to a multiplex you just feel you are being fleeced the whole time it is eight quid or something to get in and exorbitant popcorn on top tilda wanted to do something different something friendly affordable passionate this is a hand knitted festival we want to strip away all the commercialism so that all we are left with are good films
4593407 the fairy cakes as an entrance fee was an idea that tilda and i came up with together i remembered my grandad saying that when he was a boy he would get into the cinema for a jam jar so we considered a range of household items but fairy cakes seemed the most sensible option we will give them away to the audience
4593408 this is a dream film festival everything one does not want in film festivals is not here but we do have great classics old and beloved films that people want to see again the festival is built on the love of film not on the need to sell anything appease studios or make careers
4593409 there is a great feeling in the town about this festival the building itself is a special place locally
4593410 tilda swinton has the imagination and integrity to do something really important here
4593411 no i am actually just on my way to the bookies across the road to put on a bet
4593412 i still have a great passion for the game of football
4593413 i still very much love it in my heart i still feel like i can compete at a pro bowl level but the situation is going to have to be right im not going to just play for any team or any situation
4593414 the money market took a big hiccup and that delayed me getting the financing
4593415 it wasnt tims fault a lot of people thought that
4593416 but they have hired an awesome new frontman that boiseans need to check out next monday marty casey marty was in chicagos lovehammers and will be familiar to a ton of people as the 2nd place guy on rock star inxs a couple years ago he was the 1 vote recipient on the show even though inxs picked that other guy who seems to have sunk without a trace jd fortune l a gunss tracii guns founder of guns n roses with axl totally reinvented his former 80s sunset strip band earlier this year he had brought in marty to co write their next album due out in march 2009 and liked him so much they asked him to step in as the new lead singer

4593465 since the spectrum pricing formula is auctioned to which the ministry of finance is fully agreed and the process in which the ministry of finance is fully involved we are consistent with the decision of the cabinet
4593466 it is therefore surprising that the ministry of finance has now decided to express its reservations on procedural aspects
4593467 as we promised 3g auction will take place within the scheduled time there will not be any deviation from the announced guidelines
4593468 the issue of guidelines without any consultations with the ministry of finance either within the forum of telecom commission or outside is inappropriate and contrary to the cabinet decision
4593469 in addition the chairman of the committee is member finance telecom commission any concern of ministry of finance can be considered by this committee and action taken thereof
4593470 the reserve price recommended by the telecom regulatory authority of india has been doubled and trais concurrence also obtained it is needless to say that there is no method of fixing reserve price for spectrum and the doubling of reserve price as indicated by trai is only the beginning of price discovery through auction
4593471 as far as time frame is concerned there will be no deviation from what we announced on august 1 2008

4593492 it was definitely a mood of delirium that appeared to rule the scene causing all that i saw to shimmer vaguely in my sight as if viewed through the gauzy glow of a sick room a haziness that had no precise substance distorting without in any way obscuring the objects behind or within it there was an atmosphere of disorder and commotion that i sensed in the streets of the town as if its delirious mood were only a soft prelude to great pandemonium i heard the sound of something that i could not identify an approaching racket that caused me to take refuge in a narrow passageway between a pair of high buildings nestled in this dark hiding place i watched the street and listened as that nameless clattering grew louder it was a medley of clanging and creaking of groaning and croaking a dull jangle of something unknown as it groped its way through the town a chaotic parade in honor of some special occasion of delirium the street that i saw beyond the narrow opening between the two buildings was now entirely empty the only thing i could glimpse was a blur of high and low structures which appeared to quiver slightly as the noise became louder and louder the parade closing in though from which direction i did not know the formless clamor seemed to envelop everything around me and then suddenly i could see a passing figure in the street dressed in loose white garments it had an egg shaped head that was completely hairless and as white as paste a clown of some kind who moved in a way that was both casual and laborious as if it were strolling underwater or against a strong wind tracing strange patterns in the air with billowed arms and pale hands it seemed to take forever for this apparition to pass from view but just before doing so it turned to peer into the narrow passage where i had secreted myself and its greasy white face was wearing an expression of bland malevolence others followed the lead figure including a team of ragged men who were harnessed like beasts and pulled long bristling ropes they also moved out of sight leaving the ropes to waver slackly behind them the vehicle to which these ropes were attached by means of enormous hooks rolled into the scene its great wooden wheels audibly grinding the pavement of the street beneath them it was a sort of platform with huge wooden stakes rising from its perimeter to form the bars of a cage there was nothing to secure the wooden bars at the top and so they wobbled with the movement of the parade hanging from the bars and rattling against them was an array of objects haphazardly tethered by cords and wires and straps of various kinds i saw masks and shoes household utensils and naked dolls large bleached bones and the skeletons of small animals bottles of colored glass the head of a dog with a rusty chain wrapped several times around its neck and sundry scraps of debris and other things i could not name all knocking together in a wild percussion i watched and listened as that ludicrous vehicle passed by in the street nothing else followed it and the enigmatic parade seemed to be at an end now only a delirious noise fading into the distance

4593498 one of the worlds leading neo symbolist photographers of our time
4593499 i found santerinerosss photographs initially impressive but there is a repetitive quality in its symbolism and manufactured mood that palled after a while
4593500 it is totally manufactured and the work is best in small does theres a lot going on but at the same time if you saw tons of impressionists or picassos or any one movement all lined up youd say its repetitive my work is all part of the same epic story my life my dreams my loves my lusts my desires
4593501 santerinross world view is a bleak one about as bleak as it gets but his ability to find beauty in dark moments is a rare quality that only the most skilled cinema craftsman can achieve it could be interesting to see how santerineross handles moving into other territories such as music videos or features his macabre visuals could let themselves nicely if paired with the proper material
4593502 we wanted a safe cream that we could put the caffeine into

4593526 we expect the further drop in energy prices in early august to further boost sentiment though sentiment remains at weak recessionary levels that are at odds with continued modest growth in the economy
4593527 its been a long summer but thats just the way things work now
4593528 it was worth the wait hes a very good addition to our organization this guy is a guy that we needed we had to wait it was worth it and its done i think we all should just be happy
4593529 i think if things work out and he has health on his side hes going to be a guy that well be able to challenge but a timeline i dont know i wouldnt try to put any pressure or anything like that either
4593530 we pursued the minor league contract as long as we could but we just realized that this was something that would work for us we decided we would go this way because that was what we needed to do it were very happy with it were very happy with the terms and very happy with the fact that weve added such a quality player its very exciting
4593531 if he has to start moralising i would have a lot more respect for him if he did so in a context that acknowledged the racism so many black people still face and looked at serious policies to tackle poverty and an education system that condemns some of our most vulnerable young people to failure

4593534 either way whilst the response which listed prices for an ounce did fluctuate mildly the truism remains that it costs aroud 15 for a henry but only if youre buying in bulk now gone are the days of red seal soap bar and slate its all about the smelly stuff now
4593535 non non i have ze how you say ze assurances of ze russians zet eet is done
4593536 i just ran the first 50 meters then i looked around to make sure i was safe and shut it off
4593537 i just came to run and do what i can do
4593538 i cant be too mad because thats all i had today so im just happy that i was in contention until the last little bit when they started pulling away all in all it was a good experience
4593539 it was just that i gave them too much in the beginning in the sense that between the 800 and 1 200 meter mark they had a little gap with this caliber of guys you cant really make up that gap in the last 300 meters thats what i got myself into but im still happy
4593540 i didnt get it done when i needed to i guess i went out there in the third round when i was in 10th place and hit a throw that got me into the eight man final it may be a small minor minute victory but at least i showed that when the pressures on i can at least do something
4593541 i just ran the first 50 meters then i looked around to make sure i was safe and shut it off
4593542 i just came to run and do what i can do
4593543 i cant be too mad because thats all i had today so im just happy that i was in contention until the last little bit when they started pulling away all in all it was a good experience
4593544 it was just that i gave them too much in the beginning in the sense that between the 800 and 1 200 meter mark they had a little gap with this caliber of guys you cant really make up that gap in the last 300 meters thats what i got myself into but im still happy
4593545 i didnt get it done when i needed to i guess i went out there in the third round when i was in 10th place and hit a throw that got me into the eight man final it may be a small minor minute victory but at least i showed that when the pressures on i can at least do something
4593546 i know that i was more than capable of hitting a throw to potentially win but potentially doesnt win championships so you kind of have to do it
4593547 it is a tragedy its a great tragedy for our school
4593548 the young lady in question was a wonderful young lady a gifted musician very popular at school just a really sweet little girl
4593549 we were taken away in a van to a chinese police station we were then split up and werent taken to cells i dont know if that is because they didnt want us to see the conditions the prisoners are usually kept in
4593550 instead we were taken to offices it just goes to show the difference that having a british passport has if i was from tibet i think i may have been treated very differently
4593551 while the chinese government has built a gleaming new building for its official mouthpiece and its public relations strategy has become more sophisticated the propaganda it uses to maintain its iron fisted control over tibet remains the same
4593552 that is something i would like to accomplish i understand a lot of things have to come together for me to accomplish that goal so if it comes to pass its going to be great
4593553 early on i understood that my life and the cards i was dealt wasnt all aces and spades
4593554 so i had to deal with what i was dealt with and the obstacles that came and overcome those things for a person like myself to get in college coming from poverty and from a neighborhood where guys dont even understand what college is i feel like i was ahead of the curve
4593555 selvin young was obviously injured at texas but he came in here stayed healthy and took advantage of an opportunity
4593556 anytime you get a scholarship and are averaging about 5 5 to 6 yards per carry at texas you know you have a big upside and he is taking advantage of that opportunity here
4593557 well he guaranteed 2 000 yards i think so he is going to be much better
4593558 my mind set will never change i still feel like i have come off the street
4593559 im a guy most people look at and say where did this guy come from he wasnt a top draft pick its already in the back of peoples minds that he shouldnt be at the top so my mind frame is to stay hungry and believe in myself this is just the beginning
4593560 every time things got hard i put it in my book hopefully when i am done somebody else will be motivated by it if 2 000 yards happens it will be a great ending we will have to see
4593561 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4593562 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4593563 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it
4593564 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4593565 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4593566 ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
4593567 the only way a democratic party will have the credibility to elect a democrat in november is if the party uses a legitimate process to choose its nominee
4593568 we are not per se a clinton support group we are a democratic party get your act together support group
4593569 i have been voting democratic for 18 years i only voted for democrats from dog catcher to president and everything in between
4593570 i will be voting for someone other than barack obama come november
4593571 id say the vast majority of people at fort detrick think he had nothing to do with it
4593572 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
4593573 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
4593574 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
4593575 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
4593576 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
4593577 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
4593578 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
4593579 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
4593580 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
4593581 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
4593582 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
4593583 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
4593584 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
4593585 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
4593586 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
4593587 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say
4593588 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
4593589 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile

4593601 its my fourth olympics ive trained less than seven months for it and to be honest with you i had a ball out there
4593602 its exciting regardless of whether you guys write me off or whatever you did that last year and not only insulted or disappointed myself but my family but i tell you what i came back and im looking forward to next year you cant take this moment away from me no matter how much you write it off
4593603 are you kidding me if i came out here and spoke to you and said i didnt want to be back i would have told you that but actually leaving there and thinking i missed that final i dont actually like that feeling and want to get ready for next years final
4593604 the bronze medal was up for grabs flanagan took advantage and ran really well and got that bronze that i wanted but i cant do anything about that
4593605 i went out pretty fast and i kinda died i just didnt feel too great today
4593606 it was the second fastest time ever and an olympic record the world record was set a long time ago 1993 by chinese wang junxia to be the second fastest is pretty amazing
4593607 everything went to plan it was just a really good race
4593608 hopefully it wont take too much out of me for the next two races but ive got two more days before the semi on sunday
4593609 i didnt actually want to be in the lead coming into the straight but that will give me a lot of confidence i beat a couple of good guys in that field who i think are sure finalists so to take the lead confidently and feel that good with 200 metres to go gives me a lot of confidence

4593637 es geht darum dass man den anderen auf negative vielleicht auch l cherliche umst nde aufmerksam macht die er tagt glich lebt ohne ihn dabei zu verletzen
4593638 the point is to draw attention to muslims in negative and even ridiculous circumstances that they daily experience without injuring them in the process
4593639 people have long known about the eruption and have long known about the famine but no one has previously linked the two
4593640 some people didnt see the sun for months and agricultural production was devastated for the next two years
4593641 at this most excruciating moment this other thing comes along to take things where theyd never gone before
4593642 everybody knew hunger and the idea that you should plan for a bad year was ingrained in these societies
4593643 hawks makes a compelling case that not only is human evolution ongoing in the past 10 000 years but it has sped up
4593644 it takes a long time for a biologically complex system like language to evolve
4593645 i have no idea why certain variants show up in some populations and not in others
4593646 we have to be cautious in making inferences about the rate of selective change in human populations
4593647 hawks has done a nice job of showing that all kinds of genes have been changing at a faster rate in the last 50 000 years so its not surprising that genes related to hearing are on that bandwagon
4593648 sounds that went on uninterrupted for long periods of time it was a constant ultrasound and it didnt matter where you were the sound was there
4593649 i had to cut down 100 trees on my lot
4593650 this hypothesis namely that trees send signals to beetles needs a lot of experimental work to back it up
4593651 its difficult to study because to take one example no one knows what the insects hearing mechanism is or even if it is responding to ultrasound
4593652 we really know very little about how they talk to each other and what signals they send
4593653 these guys are highly acoustic they talk to each other all the time and so they have to have acoustic organs
4593654 we will put electrodes in certain regions of the beetles nervous system play sounds and see if the nervous system reacts
4593655 the numbers the canadians have are shocking and that is just one class of beetle and one class of trees
4593656 if other insects are doing the same thing i am especially thinking of moths infecting deciduous boreal forests in
4593657 there is a possibility that you could have an acoustic signal to break up or slow down a beetle infestation
4593658 again the bioacoustic idea is still a hypothesis one that has to be carefully tested in a lab
4593659 the idea that beetles create sound passes muster with me so using ultrasound to confuse beetles is possible at least at short distances

4593681 the history of atlantic records and of sound of contemporary music would be very different without the impact that jerrys great ears uncanny intuition and true genius had on countless artists and their music atlantic said
4593682 he will be deeply missed by those who knew him and more importantly by the millions who knowingly or unknowingly have heard his phenomenal body of work
4593683 rhythm and blues before joining atlantic as a partner in 1953
4593684 dusty in memphis album and later he and ertegun signed led zeppelin to atlantic
4593685 he understood music and musicians in a way few label executives did and was able to inspire them to do their best and most original work atlantic said
4593686 our condolences go out to jerrys family and friends during this sad and difficult time
4593687 the guy in the middle who is neither an engineer nor a musician but an ear to hear what is happening
4593688 you keep it rolling you know the choices that must be made he said in my analysis the final determination is that if you cant go out and change the music you arent a producer you are merely presiding at a happening

4593691 all i know is that hes healthy and he threw the ball well
4593692 well get him here so dan can see him against some hitters
4593693 i never knew how boring this game was until i gave up beer
4593694 oh wait we won last year ok manny just around a bit and hit the ball if you feel like it whatever we can shell out 20 million for you to nap if youd like
4593695 my contract is up this year but my employer has the option to rehire me for the next two years but maybe if you work a deal with them to replace me with someone they find acceptable i can work for you instead
4593696 it would in effect be an open invitation to every selfish superstar in baseball to pull a manny act up stop hustling stop trying refuse to play make up an injury whatever you have to do to get back out there on the free agent market its all worth it
4593697 we gained 10 places on alexa in italy and our own stats show a 5 increase in traffic from italy which has been quite stable before
4593698 the first step that our team is going to have to understand from day one is you have to have the belief that youre going to win the stanley cup
4593699 to do that you have to believe that you can win every game i cant wait to get started
4593700 its been proven that if you cant do one phase on offense then youre not going to be as successful as you want to be
4593701 we have to do our jobs if we do that we can open some holes in the run game and put brett in position to throw some deep balls
4593702 you cant be a leader right away you have to prove yourself first and show people that youre willing to work being a leader isnt a title its something you earn
4593703 a lot of times people look at those guys on paper and think that we added a right tackle and a left guard and those players will just fit in
4593704 but youre talking about players who came from other systems where theyre used to different terminology and different techniques it takes time for all that to come together
4593705 the way the country really behaves after the tourists are gone
4593706 the food is the worst thing weve had the same two courses for dinner for a year sometimes there hasnt been enough for everyone those who have arrived last havent got anything to eat

4593708 the food is the worst thing weve had the same two courses for dinner for a year sometimes there hasnt been enough for everyone those who have arrived last havent got anything to eat

4593712 as this thing gets rolling the newness will wear off and it gets down to playing and ill keep saying this im here for one reason and thats to help this team win no other reason
4593713 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys
4593714 you just cant go in with a hard number because the game especially in the preseason flows so differently that you dont know how long the defense is going be to out how long the offense is going to be out what the situation is going to be how long theyre going to keep their group out
4593715 so its hard to say its going to be this number hard and fast and thats what we are sticking to but usually youre trying to get 10 or 12 reps
4593716 theres going to be a big crowd out there the excitement thats being created around brett coming to us is giving us a lot of energy throughout camp so itll be fun come saturday
4593717 the big thing with him is getting comfortable with calling the plays
4593718 again the plays are the same thing but as a quarterback the more you call it the more you can become comfortable with it the more you can actually see the picture of the play in your mind
4593719 you see him in green bay and youre like you never know this guy could be throwing me passes someday and now that hes here its weird hes throwing me passes now and im just trying to make sure i dont make him mad and catch everything he throws my way
4593720 hopefully hell think hes so special that well only have to face him for a series or two
4593721 it would have been an easier offseason for me bretts all the hype and all the talk right now and thats fine now i can go back to work and just do what i do
4593722 as if that blind rage had washed me clean rid me of hope for the first time in that night alive with signs and stars i opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world finding it so much like myself so like a brother really i felt that i had been happy and that i was happy again

4593797 i could never understand why it mattered that i was a catholic police ombudsman it baffled me but eventually i was told this was the teaching of some churches to their people and that meant i could understand a lot of what has been said about me
4593798 ryanair planned to clamp down on screenscraping websites that he says are ripping customers off by adding
4593799 the battle against prince nuada which is to lead to co antrim in northern ireland
4593800 it appears to be more difficult for a north of irelander to allow an honest difference of opinion in an opponent so that he is apt to regard the terms opponent and enemy as synonymous
4593801 the short answer is his people are indeed from ulster from county antrim ireland they left from coleraine town circa 1719 and appear on the border of the pennsylvania and maryland colony in the early 1720s his immigrant ancestor was named alexander mckean and yes the two lads who run the ulster heritage dna project are from the same mccain family
4593802 the conservative party has no issue with the orange order it is a perfectly legal organisation and many of its members are engaged in charity and church work
4593803 co operation ireland has been very successful in a conflict situation for the last 30 years but the context has changed out there and the challenge will be to be as equally successful in the next 30 years of co operation ireland in a different context
4593804 youre in a peace building context people have this view that the peace is done and its all over and to some extent that part of the conflict is over but its by no means stable yet yes a lot of the engagement has been at the top political level but actually the grassroots hasnt been engaged in it
4593805 all of that political agreement needs stabilised and needs underpinned at the grassroots level which is what peacebuildings about in some ways the peace making is a pragmatic enterprise whereas peace building is much more vision oriented its not about single events its about process and a process that will take years and so the context becomes more difficult
4593806 international land border here which no other police force in the uk has
4593807 no one has gone public to say the army council has gone away
4593808 what i can say with absolute certainty is that in terms of pira activity that is to say terrorist activity its not happening
4593809 does it mean all the provos have gone into nine to five jobs of course it doesnt there are some involved in organised crime without a doubt but operating as individuals not operating as an organisation and i think thats the key distinguishing factor
4593810 on the other side of course it must be hugely frustrating to those who dont have that confidence
4593811 so i can understand i think the unionist community are going to look for a lot more than just a statement that pira have gone away before they are satisfied but we are not seeing activity
4593812 it pira has reduced in size but it is there
4593813 the organisation is dedicated to following a political path but it will not disband to the point where it could not carry out an operation if it needed to
4593814 anyone who can help us prevent this type of activity should come forward to the police
4593815 those responsible for planting these devices show a callous disregard for human life
4593816 those responsible seem intent on following their own selfish agenda and the only way for communities to be free from such activity is to help officers bring these criminals before the courts
4593817 there was no claim of responsibility but dissident republicans were suspected of being responsible the devices were being examined
4593818 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland

4593842 was throwing guys down during the 9 on 7 inside drill
4593843 having a heck of a timing beating up on people
4593844 i dont think dallas was used to that type of practice
4593845 we hit those guys finished 13 3 last year so they probably can afford to relax in practice and coast through certain drills us we went 7 9 so were on the ground right now and were trying to get back up that hill
4593846 i dont think dallas was used to that type of practice
4593847 we hit those guys finished 13 3 last year so they probably can afford to relax in practice and coast through certain drills us we went 7 9 so were on the ground right now and were trying to get back up that hill
4593848 quick lets get the republicans out of power before there is nothing left in the country for the democrats to ruin
4593849 in brightest day in blackest night no evil shall escape my sight let those who worship evils might beware my power green lanterns light
4593850 is the game worth 15 a month for the things i enjoy about it
4593851 15 00 per month thats like a decent bottle of wine per month sure i can afford that
4593852 all year this team has been great at dealing with pressure of being down a goal or tied or having a team come back
4593853 weve always fought for 90 100 whatever it takes minutes i like the fact that we are creating the chances and having different people score goals the next step is having people finish them
4593854 we need someone that can integrate the spirit and technical level of the team as well as the ambition of the team he also has to have an immense desire to join arsenal football club as well experience can help but first is quality then experience but most importantly quality

4593859 i dont know the man but i grew up watching him on tv
4593860 the true soldier fights not because he hates what is in front of him but
4593861 as technology improves its imperative that we arm our law enforcement officials with state of the art equipment for fighting crime
4593862 technology has provided new venues for criminals but it has also given us new tools to capture them
4593863 not one of these reports is based on any authentic information with any confirmation from anyone authoritative our press dreams up these reports at night and they get them confirmed in the morning from the information minister sherry rehman who is a party to the other side or they quote unnamed sources
4593864 president musharraf has two choices he must quit or fight the impeachment
4593865 the only course of action left for general musharraf is to immediately resign and surrender himself before the law of the land
4593866 we plan to move the impeachment resolution in parliament sometime next week
4593867 stubbornness in refusing to let go of his office as the only reason for the crisis in the country
4593868 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4593869 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4593870 absolutely clearly demonstrates what we had said earlier the deployment has the russian federation as its target
4593871 it is sad news for all who live on this densely populated continent but it is not dramatic
4593872 poland is an independent country and its an ally of the united states and its a democratic country to whose security the united states is committed
4593873 russia should welcome having democracies on its border not threaten them
4593874 i think the russian behavior over the last several days is generally concerning not only to the united states but to all of our european allies
4593875 from my point of view this deal is not directed against russia
4593876 we will continue to advocate that talks be continued on how we can convince russia of this and also include it
4593877 they said are you open for a discussion i said yes were open for a discussion
4593878 theyre looking for us to release sonny bill from his contract hes one year into a five year deal hes contracted to us we havent started putting any figures on it we have no idea of where this will head
4593879 a financial settlement is going to be found at the beginning of next week
4593880 its affected our recruitment its affected our players currently its affected our sponsorship and it will affect our attendances
4593881 its a big decision and all those things will be taken into account when we start talking to them there isnt another sonny bill out there to replace him
4593882 its very dynamic and charismatic and i have to say that she from what i know about her makinti is very like that
4593883 could signal the beginning of what is known as the maunder minimum
4593884 tapping reports no change in the suns magnetic field so far this cycle and if the sun remains quiet for another year or two it may indicate a repeat of that period of drastic cooling of the earth bringing massive snowfall and severe weather to the northern hemisphere
4593885 south america this year experienced one of its coldest winters in decades in buenos aires snow fell for the first time since the year 1918
4593886 johannesburg south africa had the first significant snowfall in 26 years australia experienced the coldest june ever
4593887 the real reasons for climate change are uneven solar radiation
4593888 astrophysics knows two solar activity cycles of 11 and 200 years both are caused by changes in the radius and area of the irradiating solar surface
4593889 earth has passed the peak of its warmer period and a fairly cold spell will set in quite soon by 2012 real cold will come when solar activity reaches its minimum by 2041 and will last for 50 60 years or even longer
4593890 there is no proof that carbon dioxide is causing or precedes global warming
4593891 all indications are that the minor warming cycle finished in 2001 and that arctic ice melting is related to cyclical orbit tilt axis changes in earths angle to the sun
4593892 as more than 80pc of australian exports are price taking commodities any carbon emissions cost is going to be borne by the domestic producer and exporter and require large compensation under any carbon trading scheme
4593893 this compensation will be seen as a producer subsidy under wto guidelines at a time when australia is supposed to be leading by good example in freer trade for the rest of the world
4593894 all this cost is borne by taxpayers yet where exactly are the benefits beyond normal pollution control regulations
4593895 farmers could be forced into bankruptcy by having to refund money they do not have
4593896 to introduce a new high cost system based on fear and feeding off superstition does not make good fiscal governance when there are serious economic distortions measurement difficulties investment disincentives potential carbon market liquidity problems and a low probability of achieving any benefits in energy reduction or environment improvement

4593914 obama cree que uno de los grandes problemas que enfrenta la econom a de hoy es la falta de ingreso discrecional para los asalariados de clase media
4593915 por ello es que este plan no aumentar cualquier tipo de impuestos en parejas que obtengan menos que 250 000 d lares anualmente o cualquier persona soltera que genere menos de 200 000 d lares no en impuestos sobre la renta a la ganancia de capitales dividendos o de renta

4593923 thats how i play and its nice to be doing it again
4593924 ive had my reasons to feel a bit down but considering how ive played the last few months ive a lot to smile about this week

4593946 remove debris from the fence within washes arroyos immediately after rain events to ensure that no backwater flooding occurs
4593947 the callousness displayed by homeland security in ignoring warnings to damage a national treasure is mind boggling
4593948 the border wall does not stop humans but it will stop jaguars and other wildlife it is already wreaking havoc on the southern part of oregon pipe national monument
4593949 the contrast between the report findings and the environmental assessment displays the bush administrations wholly meaningless approach to environmental analysis
4593950 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
4593951 its time for homeland security to lift its embargo on environmental laws
4593952 it cannot be found that the findings inferences conclusions and decisions of the bocc denying the applications of kirk hughes development llc were in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions

4593981 the sindh assembly adopted unanimously on wednesday a resolution calling upon president pervez musharraf to take a vote of confidence from his electoral college or resign immediately
4593982 the sixty deposed judges would be restored by an executive order before presidential impeachment if the president opted to challenge the move or the contents of charge sheet in the apex court
4593983 the pml q is facing an uncertain fate and there is a risk that it may evaporate right after the exit of pervez musharraf from the presidency most of its leaders and mps candidly admit
4593984 president pervez musharraf has finally decided to step down soon after pakistan independence day august 14 highly placed sources told waqt news here on tuesday according to the understanding reached it was decided that musharraf would not be held responsible for the past misdeeds and would be allowed to walk away scot free
4593985 the sharif zardari joint press conference in islamabad at the end of three days of talks had a sense of d j vu about it the three main decisions announced by nawaz sharif and zardari were the impeachment of the president the restoration of the judges after the impeachment and the repeal of the seventeenth amendment but just because these measures have been agreed upon and announced does not mean they will be implemented
4593986 the disposition of the white house and us state department is the key to the issue despite his unpopularity president musharraf remains the more rational choice for americans
4593987 as the country hurtles towards the climactic confrontation between nawaz and musharraf the politicians may well win the country however may learn that a politicians victory can be the peoples defeat
4593988 the only viable option is to begin the exercise that should have been started in 1947 to establish a democratic parliamentary federation for this reason gen musharrafs exit and an end to the insurgency in the north are essential prerequisites to the building of a state the people may be proud to own happy to nourish and willing to die for
4593989 this impeachment with all that manipulation will perhaps make the military realise that politics sullies their good let there be impeachment

4594438 there is no one like you lord you are great and you are well known for your power 7 everyone should revere you o king of all nations
4594439 obey me if you do i will be your god and you will be my people live exactly the way i tell you and things will go well with you
4594440 go up and down through the streets of jerusalem look around and take note search through its public squares see if you can find a single person who deals honestly and tries to be faithful and true if you can then i will not punish this city
4594441 surely it is only the poor and ignorant who act this way they act like fools because they do not know what the lord demands they do not know what their god requires of them
4594442 what sign slide 11 before that day can you show us since you are doing these things
4594443 destroy this temple and in three days i will raise it up again
4594444 this temple has been under construction for forty six years and are you going to raise it up in three days
4594445 look we are going up to jerusalem and everything that is written about the son of man by slide 15 before that day the prophets will be accomplished 32 for he will be handed over to the gentiles he will be mocked mistreated and spat on 33 they will flog him severely and kill slide 16 before that day him yet on the third day he will rise again
4594446 get behind me satan you are a stumbling block to me because you are not slide 20 before that day setting your mind on gods interests but on mans
4594447 an evil and adulterous generation asks for a sign but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet jonah 40 for just as jonah was in the belly of the huge fish for three days and three nights so the son of man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights
4594448 the son of man will be betrayed into the hands of men they will kill him and after three days he will rise
4594449 do not be alarmed you are looking for jesus the nazarene who was crucified he has been raised he is not here look there is the place where they laid him 7 but go tell his disciples even peter that he is going ahead of you into galilee you will see him there just as he told you
4594450 they have taken my lord away and i do not know where they have put him
4594451 do not be afraid i know that you are looking for jesus who was crucified matthew 28 8 net so they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy and ran to tell his disciples
4594452 do not be alarmed you are looking for jesus the nazarene who was crucified he has been raised he is not here look there is the place where they laid him
4594453 why do you look for the living among the dead 6 he is not here but has been raised remember how he told you while he was still in galilee 7 that the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise again
4594454 woman why are you weeping who are you looking for
4594455 sir if you have carried him away tell me where you have put him and i will take him
4594456 do not touch me for i have not yet ascended to my father
4594457 they have taken the lord from the tomb and we dont know where they have put him
4594458 these are my words that i spoke to you while i was still with you that everything written about me in the law of moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled
4594459 thus it stands written that the messiah would suffer and would rise from the dead on the third day 47 and repentance for the forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in his name to all nations beginning from jerusalem 48 you are witnesses of these things
4594460 by what power or by what name did you do this
4594461 rulers of the people and elders 9 if we are being examined today for a good deed done to a sick man
4594462 it was necessary to speak the word of god to you first since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life we are turning to the gentiles
4594463 for your sake we encounter death all day long we were considered as sheep to be slaughtered
4594464 hallelujah for the lord our god the all powerful reigns
4594465 i believe in music the way some people believe in fairy tales
4594466 everyone has their own song that they must sing everyone has a book in them to write everyone has a poem in them that must come out everyone has something unique that god has given to them the church has become the creatives worst enemy
4594467 then you will call upon me and come and pray to me and i will listen to you you will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart i will be found by you
4594468 do we need to get rights that other countries have

4594473 war is an ugly thing but not the ugliest of things the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks nothing is worth a war is worse
4594474 after what happened it s unlikely ossetians and abkhazians will ever be able to live together with georgia in one state
4594475 the problem is that the ossetians and abkhazians themselves trust nobody except russian peacekeepers
4594476 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4594477 for the first time in history we have had four years of nearly 9 per cent economic growth but there are new challenges that we face we have the challenge of inflation
4594478 i know how much each one of you is concerned about the recent rise in prices the inflation we have seen this year is basically due to external factors
4594479 our government has worked hard to ensure that in india the rate of inflation is not as high as in many other countries
4594480 government has not raised the price of kerosene and fertilisers we have not raised the issue price of wheat and rice under pds
4594481 this year we hope to send an indian spacecraft chandrayaan to the moon
4594482 our computer is for fortune 500 companies and oh yes its also for consumers to use a home
4594483 we have tried to give relative importance of different categories of cities in terms of earning spending and saving behaviour of these urban households
4594484 the decision is being taken to do away with the day to day chores of the servicing required for the clients websites and media houses it had become unmanageable by limited manpower in times of some major technical hitches the task will now be taken care by vendors known to us and we plan to complete the procedure by october this year
4594485 we have around eight clients opting for the real time access while the number for the delayed segment stands around 100 and even with the markets down we havent seen slowdown in demands for such products for websites
4594486 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4594487 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4594488 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4594489 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4594490 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4594491 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4594492 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4594493 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4594494 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4594495 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4594496 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4594497 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4594498 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4594499 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4594500 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4594501 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4594502 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4594503 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4594504 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4594505 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4594506 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4594507 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4594508 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4594509 tricias lymphoma in her lungs did not respond well to the

4594515 this cup is the new covenant in my blood which is poured out for you
4594516 therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the lord a man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup

4594522 dont leave money on the table dont let anyone leave the table
4594523 how much money are you making who cares if you have a million users if you are losing money each month
4594524 by hosting these poland is making itself a target this is 100 percent certain
4594525 it becomes a target for attack such targets are destroyed as a first priority
4594526 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4594527 absolutely clearly demonstrates what we had said earlier the deployment has the russian federation as its target
4594528 it is sad news for all who live on this densely populated continent but it is not dramatic
4594529 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4594530 moscow must honor its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4594531 if someone continues to attack our citizens our peacekeepers we will of course respond in just the same way we have responded there should be no doubt about this
4594532 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4594533 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the us over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4594534 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4594535 this is a planning took where all things are going
4594536 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4594537 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4594538 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4594539 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4594540 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4594541 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4594542 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4594543 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4594544 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4594545 who was cyril joad and what did he contribute to philosophy
4594546 within a seam bursting eclecticism russell bergson and plato had somehow all to make room for themselves as the representatives respectively of matter life and value the result was a conglomeration of considerable popular appeal but little philosophical consequence the fact remains that joad an invigoratingly polemical broadcaster essayist and lecturer at a time when the ideal of good taste was threatening to destroy personality represented philosophy to a large segment of the british public what this proves either about philosophy or about the british public i should not care to say
4594547 that under no circumstances will we fight for king and country
4594548 that this house regrets the influence exercised by the us as the dominant power among the democratic nations
4594549 if you object that christ was not a philosopher i can only beg you to wait until you know as much philosophy as i do before venturing to contradict
4594550 objective in the sense that they are found by the human
4594551 moreover these values are not just arbitrary pieces of cosmic furniture lying about as it were in the universe without explanation coherence or connection but are revelations of a unity that underlies them are in fact the ways in which god reveals himself to man hence those human activities which consist in or which arise out of the pursuit of truth the cultivation of moral goodness or the creation and enjoyment of beauty are such that we cannot help but value and revere them
4594552 what we call the values and it is under this term that the forms may i think be most appropriately referred to in respect of their most outstanding manifestations as truth goodness and beauty are the modes of gods revelation of his nature to man for if this is indeed the case the revelation must be regarded as the immanence of a transcendent being in a medium which though it manifests is itself other than the being manifested now we cannot i suggest expect to achieve a know how of the mode of manifestation of a divine being
4594553 the mind is it is clear constantly interacting with the body and brain yet all attempts to envisage the mode of this interaction have been lamentable failures i venture to develop in an admittedly purely speculative direction the hypothesis that there is included in the make up of the human personality a timeless element the traditional division of the human being is not twofold into mind and body but threefold into mind body and soul or spirit i suggest that this threefold division may approximate more closely to the truth than any other
4594554 philosophy is an exceedingly difficult subject and most books on philosophy
4594555 if we put the past of life at one hundred years then the past human life
4594556 by any reckoning then the human mind is very young and it is not to be expected that it should as yet understand very much of the world in which it finds itself indeed there is a sense in which the more we know the more we become aware of the extent of our ignorance suppose for example that we think of knowledge as a little lighted patch the area of the known set in a sea of environing darkness the limitless area of the unknown then the more we enlarge the area of the lighted patch the area of the known the more also we enlarge the area of contact with the environing darkness of the unknown in philosophy then as in daily life cocksureness is a function of ignorance and dunces step in where sages fear to tread the wise man is he who realises his limitations
4594557 it is the business of philosophy as i conceive it to seek to understand the
4594558 he looks for a clue to guide him through the labyrinth for a system wherewith to classify or a purpose in terms of which to make meaningful has the universe for example any design or is it merely a fortuitous concourse of atoms is mind a fundamental feature of the universe in terms of which we are ultimately to interpret the rest or is it a mere accident an eddy in the primeval slime doomed one day to finish its pointless journey with as little noise and significance as it began it are good and evil real and ultimate principles existing independently of men or are they merely the names we give to the things of which we happen to approve and to disapprove
4594559 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4594560 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4594561 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4594562 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4594563 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4594564 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4594565 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4594566 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4594567 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4594568 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4594569 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4594570 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4594571 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4594572 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4594573 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4594574 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4594575 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4594576 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4594577 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4594578 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4594579 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4594580 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4594581 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4594582 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4594583 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4594584 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4594585 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4594586 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4594587 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4594588 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4594589 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4594590 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4594591 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4594592 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4594593 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4594594 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4594595 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4594596 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4594597 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4594598 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4594599 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4594600 email extractor lite 1 4 a web based tool designed to extract email addresses from a large piece of text probably copied and pasted from the source of a forum page actually variants of this search are the 2nd through 6th most popular searches in nigeria
4594601 extractor lite 1 4 a spam cluster with a strong concentration in west africa but some interest in north america the middle east western europe and southeast asia
4594602 tell me what you eat and ill tell you who you are
4594603 there is no obligation to provide this information yet theres no penalty so obviously they are not getting a lot of information
4594604 the agency has recommended that indirect effects are included in future sustainability reporting and is working with the government to identify a way to do this
4594605 the shocking admission that we are unable to identify the origin of nearly half the biofuels used in the u k means that the government cannot assure the british people that the biofuels in their petrol tanks have not destroyed rainforests
4594606 he didnt look good to me and i knew this could be it
4594607 i said hey bernard how are you and i kissed his forehead he shrugged his shoulders like im tired and i said i know youre tired later on that night it took a turn for the worse
4594608 he said you never seen a black man as pretty as me
4594609 if you look at folks of color even women theyre more successful in the democratic party than they are in the white uh excuse me in the laughs republican party
4594610 canadas first adult video channel offering significant canadian adult content
4594611 i think as canadians there is a bit of a tiredness in seeing all american stuff
4594612 there is always that thrill for something that is local and you get the sense that these are people you can meet at the supermarket
4594613 not less than 50 percent of the broadcast day and not less than 50 percent of the evening broadcast period to canadian programming
4594614 we want to be canadas adult channel and i think to do that 15 percent wouldnt cut it
4594615 ive been in touch with the cable companies throughout the process and went ahead with it based on the interest we had
4594616 i dont see how anybody could do anything but look into the possibility that this is a potential terrorist attack
4594617 we have no reason to believe it was nobody knows what was in this gentlemans mind
4594618 youd have to ask them why they got involved they may have more expertise with the chemicals
4594619 please ont sic talk sh t that man the christian blogger deserves what happened to him simply because having the bible in one hand and a bread in the other hand is not a correct thing kill them kill them kill them that is my massage sic
4594620 at this point we dont have any nexus to terrorism
4594621 we dont want to hear that word it hurts us it is against our religion
4594622 im not going to speculate its just a death investigation at this point
4594623 we dont even know how much its basically readily available for commercial use
4594624 a careful study of anti semitism prejudice and accusations might be of great value to many jews who do not adequately realize the irritations they inflict
4594625 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4594626 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4594627 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4594628 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4594629 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4594630 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4594631 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4594632 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4594633 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4594634 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4594635 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4594636 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4594637 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4594638 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4594639 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4594640 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4594641 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4594642 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4594643 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4594644 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4594645 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4594646 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4594647 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4594648 the key issue is that the city needs to be open to the public

4594691 t he banking problems in the united states continue to mount while the federal governments deficit continues to soar out of control
4594692 when central banks intervene in the currency markets they exchange their currency for dollars
4594693 on july 16 2008 the federal reserve reported holding 2 349 billion of us government paper in custody for central banks in its report released today this amount had grown over the past three weeks to 2 401 billion a 38 4 annual rate of growth so central banks were accumulating dollars over the past three weeks at a rate far above what one would expect as a result of the us trade deficit the logical conclusion is that they were intervening in currency markets they were buying dollars for the purpose of propping it up to keep the dollar from falling off the edge of the cliff and doing so ignited a short covering rally which is not too difficult to do given the leverage employed in the markets these days by hedge funds and others

4594695 what happened on the night of aug 7 is beyond comprehension the georgian military attacked the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali with multiple rocket launchers designed to devastate large areas russia had to respond to accuse it of aggression against small defenseless georgia is not just hypocritical but shows a lack of humanity the georgian leadership could do this only with the perceived support and encouragement of a much more powerful force

4594697 washingtons bloody fingerprints are all over the invasion of south ossetia georgia president mikhail saakashvili would never dream of launching a massive military attack unless he got explicit orders from his bosses at 1600 pennsylvania ave after all saakashvili owes his entire political career to american power brokers and us intelligence agencies if he disobeyed them hed be gone in a fortnight besides an operation like this takes months of planning and logistical support especially if its perfectly timed to coincide with the beginning of the olympic games another petty neocon touch that means pentagon planners must have been working hand in hand with georgian generals for months in advance nothing was left to chance

4594748 could descend into discussing issues that are outside of our influence such as the ordination of women and priestly celibacy that may well lead to more frustration
4594749 i think the best things happen locally you could have a national assembly but if people in the parishes dont see it as affecting them in the parishes it wont have a great influence
4594750 has been a lot of dialogue at parish and even diocesan level dialogue hasnt been there nationally
4594751 a national assembly that can bring together lay people priests and bishops to look at the issues facing the church into the future
4594752 its well past time that we had a national assembly
4594753 it wouldnt matter what it decided as there would be no comeback with a one off event no responsibility and no one would be reporting back to anyone a proper forum would have to set an agenda and report back say after a year on progress and if theres been no progress an assembly would have to ask why
4594754 lay people in ireland are very frustrated theres a growing sense of frustration and unless this is addressed they will drift away the church has to be serious about consultation consultation implies that it will be acted on theres no use in consultation where people are asked for their input and that input has no impact on decision making

4594763 theyre at a different club now and its a new challenge for them obviously its very important that theyre good players and you have to remember they are good players
4594764 i think for me to shy away from different characters and people who maybe had a bit of baggage or a bit of history i dont think its a good reflection on me ive got to try and deal with that
4594765 im not one for going round threatening people and warning them i was probably hard work myself when i was a player

4594770 i think our results against the liverpools wont make or break our season it would be nice to get off to a decent start and to show we made some sort of progress

4594811 i mean no disrespect to his widow or to his son but if i have no reason to doubt his virtues as a man neither do i have any reason to credit the miracle of russert as a journalist eager to speak truth to power
4594812 to an important personage russert asked one or two faintly impertinent questions usually about a subject of little or no concern to anybody outside the rope lines around official washington sometimes he discovered a contradiction betwen a recently issued press release and one that was distributed by the same politician some months or years previously no matter with which spoon russert stirred the butter the reply was of no interest to him not worth his notice or further comment he had sprinkled his trademark salt his work was done the important personage was free to choose from a menu offering three forms of response silence spin rancid lie if silence russert moved on to another topic if spin he nodded wisely if rancid lie he swallowed it
4594813 i remember russerts attitude as that of a trend setting restaurateur anxious to please his best customer

4594838 the short memories of american voters is what keeps our politicians in office
4594839 if you tell the truth you dont have to remember anything
4594840 when i was a boy i was told that anybody could become president im beginning to believe it
4594841 the difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion is the thickness of a prison wall
4594842 it is a good thing for an uneducated man to read a book of quotations
4594843 the man who doesnt read good books has no advantage over the man who cant read them

4594849 in california 50 women protested the impending war with iraq by lying on the ground naked and spelling out the word peace right idea wrong president
4594850 the difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion is the thickness of a prison wall
4594851 it is a good thing for an uneducated man to read a book of quotations
4594852 the man who doesnt read good books has no advantage over the man who cant read them
4594853 to accept civilization as it is practically means accepting decay
4594854 i see this as an example of an employer not so subtly pressuring workers to either hide their political beliefs or to falsify them for the benefit of their employers
4594855 wal mart rejects the suggestion that they are telling associates how to vote but as i point out in my book one of the biggest employee free speech concerns is the chill that employer pressure to conform can place on worker free expression
4594856 whether or not this turns out to amount to a technical violation of federal election commission rules it is sophistry to suggest that this kind of message from an employer doesnt have a chilling effect on the political and expressive rights of these employees its possible that they could find themselves disadvantaged if they express political views that happen to differ from those of a powerful corporate employer
4594857 georgians speak a south caucasian language not the east slavic language spoken by the russians and possess a very different alphabet from the cyrillic
4594858 they accepted christianity in 330 ad 650 years before the east slavs did they belong to the eastern orthodox christian community as does russia they possess an ancient culture and are proud of their history

4594860 basically what we found is that things are more complicated than previously thought
4594861 our study shows that there is a large genetic component to caste determination but that there is also a very strong environmental component
4594862 flexibility in caste determination is essential as it allows the colony to respond to changes in need or environmental fluctuations
4594863 differences in the nutrition that an individual assimilated during larval growth are strong predictors of caste
4594864 but there are still haves and have nots in the colony those genetic variants who have a reproductive advantage and those that dont
4594865 the history of all past society has consisted in the development of class antagonisms the exploitation of one part of society by the other

4594868 i wont ever release the original star wars on dvd
4594869 it was there from the first lap the first turn
4594870 we tried some things during practice that didnt work at all
4594871 so we went back to where we were and i think thats one of the best qualifying cars ive ever had it was a heck of a lap
4594872 im very proud of everybody at red bull racing and toyota
4594873 we picked up speed from practice but i just knew in the car it wasnt the fastest lap
4594874 and i think for that red bull team and brian this has been a track that fits their style hell be ever more of a threat come race time
4594875 its the team to beat in our sport for the last several years
4594876 to lay that lap down in practice and back it up in qualifying thats a really good feeling
4594877 really unbelievable i wish we could take that and apply it to every week but its not that easy
4594878 but anytime you can see progress feel progress patience comes easier
4594879 we feel terrible for izzy we have to move on but hes an important part of what weve done

4594883 today i face the dragon of my appetites in the form of grain based carbohydrates i am going to do a trial elimination of all grains and subsist on a diet of meat scd yogurt eggs scd legal cheeses nuts fruits and veggies i am trying to let my inner wisdom lead the sadness and loss in this is overwhelmed by the prospect of a quiet gut
4594884 many hurdles to surmount in a short amount of time
4594885 fortunately no one was seriously injured by these violent acts
4594886 however i fear that it is only a matter of time before someone is seriously hurt or even killed because of the research they perform or merely because they live in the same home as one of the targets
4594887 the escalation of violence has grown at an alarming rate
4594888 quite frankly those firebombings did cast a bright light on this issue
4594889 there is no question that it has increased the sensitivity of people to this issue
4594890 police thought they could deal with it but they couldnt
4594891 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4594892 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4594893 do you think these fellows would come this far and put their reputations and their jobs on the line if they didnt have what they say they have
4594894 now i need to get people to know who i am
4594895 this turn of events means senator maldonado will have to focus more on winning this race than preparing for a run in 2010
4594896 free to wander about the state to build a statewide campaign
4594897 im not actually sure its all me by myself right now
4594898 it was there from the first lap the first turn
4594899 we tried some things during practice that didnt work at all
4594900 so we went back to where we were and i think thats one of the best qualifying cars ive ever had it was a heck of a lap
4594901 im very proud of everybody at red bull racing and toyota
4594902 we picked up speed from practice but i just knew in the car it wasnt the fastest lap
4594903 and i think for that red bull team and brian this has been a track that fits their style hell be ever more of a threat come race time
4594904 its the team to beat in our sport for the last several years
4594905 to lay that lap down in practice and back it up in qualifying thats a really good feeling
4594906 really unbelievable i wish we could take that and apply it to every week but its not that easy
4594907 but anytime you can see progress feel progress patience comes easier
4594908 we are making progress but we still are not able to keep up the pressure for the whole game
4594909 it was a very good game but its a pity we did not take three points
4594910 we lost our rhythm after hamburg had equalized and we did not exert much pressure after that we didnt take the chances we had we missed toni badly

4594914 the riaa is fighting very hard to make sure that andersens case never reaches a jury
4594915 the government has refused to release the plan or subject it to committee scrutiny and media reports indicate that it will be implemented this fall
4594916 we therefore have no choice but to force the committee to meet as quickly as possible they have had eight months to level with canadians since the plan was reportedly approved yet they have refused what are they hiding
4594917 the way they federer and wawrinka came out last night
4594918 it seemed they had spoken to someone who knows how to play us federer was playing so well
4594919 but it was not bad it is a tough one
4594920 it was one of my goals of the season to do well here
4594921 the quarter finals will not do it for me james played well im happy for him hes a good guy i hope he goes all the way now
4594922 akhil has done well to overcome his wrist injury he will now meet gojan veaceslav of moldova and seeing his current form im confident that he will have an edge over him if he wins that he will meet either bruno julie or worapoj pitchkoom both of whom he has defeated before
4594923 as his teacher i know that he is very aggressive and motivated in the knock out stages before the finals i still remember the way he dominated the match against nigerian nestor bolum in the semi final in the 2006 commonwealth games then defeated mauritian bruno julie in the final
4594924 vijender and jitender have been doing well in their respective categories im keeping my fingers crossed and lets not forget that it aint over till it is over
4594925 and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature
4594926 and the king shall answer and say unto them verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me
4594927 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven

4594954 we started working on it in 2004 but you have to understand we didnt work everyday we have lives wed go on tour so it wasnt all the time but every once in a while till we started to get serious we all discussed it together always collaborating and getting other peoples opinions
4594955 the message couldnt be plainer see that itty bitty little tire gauge if you vote for obama thats how big your penis is if you vote for mccain on the other hand your penis is as big as this rig thrusting its gigantic shaft in and out of the ground real men think keeping your tires inflated is for weenies
4594956 botswana does not accept the result of the june 27 run off election in zimbabwe as it violated the core principles of sadc the african union and the united nations
4594957 according to our rules for a meeting to proceed we need two thirds of members
4594958 there is a meeting with president mugabe thereafter arthur mutambara thereafter morgan tsvangirai
4594959 they are in progress he is meeting with them one by one
4594960 you have tsvangirais backers who are playing hardball and insisting on the virtual disappearance of robert mugabe and youve got robert mugabes backers insisting he remains maintains some kind of executive powers
4594961 this is a hot issue which calls for zimbabweans themselves to be more committed but discussions are going very well and we expect good results from the sadc meeting
4594962 we really have to face the fact that mistakes are made in museums just as they are made anywhere else
4594963 museums are in the habit of hiding these things away
4594964 any museum in this country and most of the important museums in europe who have coptics have the bad along with good
4594965 whether its because weve paid for it or someone with a fancy degree said it was genuine once we make a decision everything that happens after that gets piled in one basket and that is to vindicate the decision
4594966 i think in practical terms we have much better equipment for conservation studies and we would now ask more questions but you can never be really sure
4594967 if someone has a glass eye you can tell that something isnt quite right and a work of art is not so different it has a kind of integrity
4594968 its my fourth olympics ive trained less than seven months for it and to be honest with you i had a ball out there
4594969 its exciting regardless of whether you guys write me off or whatever you did that last year and not only insulted or disappointed myself but my family but i tell you what i came back and im looking forward to next year you cant take this moment away from me no matter how much you write it off
4594970 are you kidding me if i came out here and spoke to you and said i didnt want to be back i would have told you that but actually leaving there and thinking i missed that final i dont actually like that feeling and want to get ready for next years final
4594971 the bronze medal was up for grabs flanagan took advantage and ran really well and got that bronze that i wanted but i cant do anything about that
4594972 i went out pretty fast and i kinda died i just didnt feel too great today
4594973 it was the second fastest time ever and an olympic record the world record was set a long time ago 1993 by chinese wang junxia to be the second fastest is pretty amazing
4594974 everything went to plan it was just a really good race
4594975 hopefully it wont take too much out of me for the next two races but ive got two more days before the semi on sunday
4594976 i didnt actually want to be in the lead coming into the straight but that will give me a lot of confidence i beat a couple of good guys in that field who i think are sure finalists so to take the lead confidently and feel that good with 200 metres to go gives me a lot of confidence
4594977 what we used to call before the multicultural age facts
4594978 its my fourth olympics ive trained less than seven months for it under new coach ross dallow to be honest with you i had a ball out there its exciting a 91 000 capacity crowd
4594979 regardless of whether you guys write me or or whatever you did that last year and it not only disappointed myself but my family
4594980 but i tell you i came back and im looking forward to next year you cant take this moment away from me no matter how much you write it off
4594981 i want to be back and be ready for next years final
4594982 theres the reigning olympic champion russias natalya sadova do you know what she did 58 for 25th place
4594983 im just giving you an idea of what happens to other competitors as well she had a best of 66 threw 58 i threw 57 and had a best this year of 61 so i cant be too bad
4594984 i just ran the first 50 meters then i looked around to make sure i was safe and i shut it off
4594985 i just ran the first 50 meters then i looked around to make sure i was safe and i shut it off
4594986 i was trying to put my cap and goggles on
4594987 what michael is doing it makes the rest of us look like
4594988 i have to conserve as much physical and emotional energy as i can
4594989 i was trying to put my cap and goggles on
4594990 what michael is doing it makes the rest of us look like
4594991 i have to conserve as much physical and emotional energy as i can
4594992 if he wasnt in there i dont think id be as good
4594993 we came back to show that we are the strong team we said we were
4594994 if i was to point to something and say this could be stressful for me right now it would not be whether i get into the fedex cup
4594995 it would be you know am i going to be able to finish this year in the top 125
4594996 am i going to be able to finish in the top 150
4594997 i said i imagine yall are here to watch drew right
4594998 they kind of laughed and felt bad that they werent there to watch me i relayed to them that one of my career goals was to get where im good enough where someone might actually go to a golf course pick up a pairing sheet and say ill follow bob heintzs group today
4594999 thats kind of a vague career goal but they started to tease me about that as the day went on i guess ill follow you now id rather have attention than you know have nobody know who i was
4595000 if i was to point to something and say this could be stressful for me right now it would not be whether i get into the fedex cup
4595001 it would be you know am i going to be able to finish this year in the top 125
4595002 am i going to be able to finish in the top 150
4595003 i said i imagine yall are here to watch drew right
4595004 they kind of laughed and felt bad that they werent there to watch me i relayed to them that one of my career goals was to get where im good enough where someone might actually go to a golf course pick up a pairing sheet and say ill follow bob heintzs group today
4595005 thats kind of a vague career goal but they started to tease me about that as the day went on i guess ill follow you now id rather have attention than you know have nobody know who i was
4595006 this golf course actually sets up better for me than forest oaks did
4595007 this is more of a placement off the tee kind of golf course and hitting the greens and making some putts forest oaks was more of a shootout see how many birdies you can make if you hit it long you had an advantage over here you dont youve got to place it around the golf course which is kind of more suited to my game

4595023 ma tunnen et see teema on viimasel ajal hus etenduskunsti huvitab taas inimestevaheline suhe
4595024 vahepeal oli palju soolosid kus inimene oli ksi ning arutas ja ajas mingit oma asja

4595073 it is pretty unprecedented the state would campaign against its own citizens to influence an election
4595074 the gratuitous suggestion of a quid pro quo relationship would only serve to inflame the jury and create unfair prejudice against senator stevens
4595075 even if those staffers did not themselves testify before the grand jury it is equally problematic if fbi agents summarized testimony about protected information to the grand jury
4595076 yet the indictment does not describe the alleged falsity or concealment with any degree of specificity
4595077 these allegations are insufficient as a matter of law to provide senator stevens with fair notice of the charges against him or to ensure that the grand jury properly returned an indictment in this matter
4595078 he is constitutionally owed a statement of the specific charges against him a requirement not satisfied by a recitation of facts followed by general allegations

4595178 the place that has suffered most is south ossetia which is home to both ethnic ossetians and georgians the latter accounting for about a third of the population
4595179 ossetians fleeing the conflict zone talk of georgian atrocities and the indiscriminate killing of civilians
4595180 on august 7 after days of shooting incidents in the south ossetian conflict zone georgian president mikheil saakashvili made a speech in which he said that he had given the georgian villagers orders not to fire that he wanted to offer south ossetia unlimited autonomy within the georgian state with russia to be a guarantor of the arrangement
4595181 both sides said they were discussing a meeting the next day to discuss how to defuse the clashes
4595182 that evening however saakashvili went for the military option the georgian military launched a massive artillery attack on tskhinvali followed the next day by a ground assault involving tanks
4595183 this was a city with no pure military targets full of civilians who had been given no warning and were expecting peace talks at any moment
4595184 the attack looked designed to take everybody by surprise perhaps because much of the russian leadership was in beijing for the opening of the olympic games it also unilaterally destroyed the negotiating and peacekeeping arrangements under the aegis of the organization for security and cooperation in europe that have been in place for 16 years russian peacekeeping troops based in south ossetia were among those killed in the georgian assault
4595185 many had traveled in their nightclothes on rocky roads through the mountains and gave bloodcurdling accounts of georgian atrocities i came in the boot of a car georgian snipers were firing at us from the forest my brother stayed to fight our grandparents home was reduced to rubble we dont know where they are nothing is left of their village it was totally destroyed by rockets and tank fire alisa mamiyeva 26 a teacher in tskhinvali said from the safety of vladikavkaz in north ossetia
4595186 russia failed to back up its claims of georgian atrocities
4595187 coverage in the u s and europe is leaning heavily toward reports on the georgian casualties of russian bombing over the weekend few details are being given about the thousands said to have been killed when georgia attacked tskhinvali the capital of south ossetia on thursday and friday
4595188 the figure of 2 000 people killed is very doubtful our findings so far do not in any way confirm the russian statistics on the contrary they suggest the numbers are exaggerated
4595189 one woman told how a family of four including two children tried to flee from a georgian tank but it fired on their car and they were all burned to death said angela who like all the refugees only gave her first name
4595190 she saw the georgian tanks roll into tskhinvali the soldiers shouting hail saakashvili who is the president of georgia they destroyed the city added inna 33 who said she could not understand how the georgian troops could do that to civilians
4595191 you see your friends home burning and theres nothing you can do you just watch and cry its a genocide inna said an old woman among the refugees said all she had left was the dress she was wearing my house is destroyed she said

4595224 but there are things that bring good colors here in alaska
4595225 i love going up in the mountains in september here to see the yellows of the willows and the orange of the blueberries and the red of the bearberries and the purpley fireweed
4595226 one of the things that is really critical is cool nights
4595227 starting in september if it starts to get cool but not below freezing if you have clear cool days and cool nights it stimulates fall color
4595228 its all a pattern but its never the same which is whats really cool about it
4595229 fall will begin mid august and it will be peaking there the end of august and first week of september
4595230 and then all of a sudden those bright colors are gone and youre into winter pretty quickly
4595231 we have a more temperate climate the fall colors kick in about the third week of september and into the first week of october
4595232 are always the first to sell out the high demand for the last part of august is because of the fall colors
4595233 near the coast is the last place youll find color
4595234 from mid september to late october we see a variation of fall color rolling through from the western upper peninsula to the southeastern portion of the state
4595235 the lakes tend to pop toward the last moment mid to late october
4595236 that makes it look like evening in the middle of the day
4595237 its not uncommon to see trees turning colors sometimes even later than the first week of november
4595238 in the fall the leaves of the tree turn beautiful shades of pink and magenta

4595583 for the final we are the underdogs but the team has everything to gain and nothing to lose
4595584 at last i can repay singapore for giving me the opportunity to be where i am today
4595585 i knew the whole nation was behind me and i felt greatly encouraged and motivated
4595586 i had always questioned whether the foreign talent scheme was the way to achieve sports glory at 6 15pm when our olympic dream was realised after a nearly four hour battle i couldnt help the lump in my throat i was won over when i saw li jia wei shed tears i want to convey my congratulations and thanks to them for making history for singapore

4595602 indra is a renowned scorer and he is one for the big stage and sundays cup clash certainly fits the bill so like the rest of our attack he will be looking to redeem himself
4595603 he is still playing in an attacking position and i do not think it is fair to just pinpoint indra because the whole attack were disappointed with their play on wednesday
4595604 i do not think we deserved to lose but we definitely have to work on the attacking part of our game
4595605 our play has been too predictable so we will certainly be looking to change a few things upfront
4595606 i guess it is a case where most are fit and performing

4595626 by the second half we had pretty much perfected it
4595627 saffc are a very strong team and they will do well but if we knock them out of the cup on monday it will be hard for them when we next meet on aug 30
4595628 i dont know why i am the only target for such gossip

4595630 today i give a full score for our team they all did excellent jobs tianwei and yuegu were outstanding in their first olympics and li was also great
4595631 after her loss in the singles she was very disappointed but she adjusted her mood within five minutes to come back and win with yuegu in the doubles if we hadnt nailed the doubles we would have been in trouble so im very pleased
4595632 today i am really pleased and excited at what weve done and that weare in the final after 48 years singapore has an olympic medal and it is through a joint effort that we have reached the final
4595633 we played the semi final like it was our final

4595641 im very happy for them and for singapore its been such a long time since we won a medal at the olympics
4595642 tianwei is definitely the most impressive because shes the youngest member of the team shes the one who won two points for singapore and it was inspiring
4595643 i just prayed hard that we wouldnt see a repeat again we expected a close game with the koreans and the team played so well
4595644 tianwei was fantastic and she has so much potential shes the youngest in the team at 21 and this is only her first olympic games shes one player whom we would like to groom together with our local talents

4595664 i think its safe to say charging customers to use the lav is out of the question
4595665 charging for lavatories has never been and never will be on the table
4595666 weve actually been exploring several opportunities for increasing revenue by utilizing our lav facilities for example we recently sent out a request for proposal on a coin operated system for lav entry and toilet paper distribution unfortunately the increase in fuel cost from the added weight caused us to rule out this option only kidding of course sorry i couldnt resist we think the idea of charging customers for using the lavatory is as outrageous as the above response i can assure you that southwest airlines has never considered it nor is it on our agenda in any of our upcoming meetings
4595667 northwest airlines is not considering charging a fee to use the lavatories onboard our aircraft it is considered a core part of our service
4595668 charging for lavatories has never been and never will be on the table

4595670 i had a mother who brought her daughter in pulled up her shirt and asked us to wax the girls back the hair didnt seem to be bothering the little girl but the mom was embarrassed and wanted it done

4595680 but i was definitely aware of how bad the new jersey one was
4595681 it starts out in a familiar vein one more attempt to define the nature of someones exquisite love
4595682 but mentioning a cab is somewhat of a step down and finally at the end it degenerates all the way to a manhole cover with the little detail about piscataway

4595727 we believe that georgia offers some of the best growth opportunities in the entire cis commonwealth of independent states region
4595728 and occasionally scary in other parts of georgia its been just horrible but there have been no heroics from bank managers in tbilisi
4595729 the last few days in tbilisi have been a bit of a walk in the park compared with that
4595730 it is very rare for the group to turn its back on a place for any reason at all
4595731 georgia is one of the most dynamic economies in the former soviet union
4595732 with gdp growth last year in excess of 10 per cent we believe that georgia offers some of the best growth opportunities in the entire cis region

4595736 our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs this pay offer is an insult to professional hard working men and women who have to operate in extremely difficult conditions
4595737 our members have had enough the liberalisation of ground handling services across uk airports has resulted in a race to the bottom which must and will stop we will not stand back and allow labour costs to determine whether contracts are won or lost
4595738 baa gatwick is disappointed to learn that the trade unions representing some swissport employees have voted for strike action later this month
4595739 baa gatwick is working closely with the handling agent and the airlines it represents to minimise the potential impact on passengers planning to travel on the proposed strike dates
4595740 a fair offer has been made to the unions in the light of the current economic climate that reflects the cost of living increase
4595741 gmb members cannot afford these low pay rises given the rising prices they have to pay for food energy and transport
4595742 the employers the airlines and the airport operator need to adjust their view as to what our members will now accept the only way they have of meeting higher prices passed on to them is to raise their own prices in higher pay rises
4595743 will see all the tensions and frustrations as the celebrity crew dish out the pretzels and pour the bubbly

4595751 the two leaders discussed the range of arab issues including recent developments on the palestinian front developments in lebanon and the confrontation between the west and iran over its nuclear file
4595752 we are waiting to receive answers from all the palestinian factions before we set a date for the inter palestinian talks
4595753 not to drag the whole region into a dangerous situation
4595754 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4595755 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4595756 unless pursuant to the written regulations or written authorization of the institution
4595757 someone remind me why should i care what the ethnic makeup of the united states might be in 2050 or the median age
4595758 its very exciting its like an indiana jones adventure its searching for a lost under water tomb
4595759 our objective is to find and protect the wreck because they are in danger of being found by people who dont have the know how and the same intention and preoccupation that we have
4595760 were out thousands of dollars and lots of other people are too
4595761 she in fact has a new management team in place and lots of ambitious plans
4595762 its a new chapter in her life and shes anxious to put her stamp on the club
4595763 they have merely wanted to be paid what they were owed and for the club to be on the financial footing it is now on
4595764 that era to my understanding and certainly among my clients is over
4595765 they are coming after these guys for tons of money over record keeping violations
4595766 these are small employers they are not sophisticated people they are trying to start a business and create jobs for people
4595767 itd probably be good to have a couple around for spares
4595768 the bottom line is that youre getting rid of the stuff
4595769 most cities are strange in the sense that periodically we have very unique things to get rid of
4595770 luckily the internet is making it easier for us to find these things a home
4595771 we didnt know what to do they weighed about five tons they were just huge
4595772 there were rumors for a while that michael jackson had expressed interest in them in bringing them down to neverland
4595773 traditionally cities are very good at buying things and not very good at getting rid of them
4595774 in this case we were able to reach a really big audience we had bids on the slide from canada and california
4595775 wasz prezydent nie jest ob udny od pocz tku popiera gruzj a teraz kiedy zacz a si wojna przyjecha do nas by pokaza e si nie boi i popiera gruzin w

4595779 we are improving all the sites making them larger and increasing the available power to each one
4595780 the tactical staff is the heart of the training academy youll not find a more professional nor dedicated group of training officers in all of california they take inexperienced recruits and mold them into leaders of our community
4595781 i know all of you can appreciate the level of accomplishment we are feeling tonight i can confidently say that everyone has earned their way the training the tactical staff gave us was mentally and physically difficult but not impossible
4595782 there is no way to thank you for your commitment to our training we can only do so by representing ourselves as law enforcement officers in our futures you expect nothing but the best
4595783 your instructors were selected because they know the demands of policing they know who has the skills character and most importantly the heart to do this job they had the courage to do the hard job of deciding who should stay and who was not cut out to wear the badge they did their job well and you can be proud that you are here tonight
4595784 secondly i want to acknowledge all of the family and friends who are here to celebrate your great achievement i know that you would not be where you are tonight were it not for their unwavering love and support family and friends this night is also a celebration of your contributions
4595785 as i began to prepare my remarks for this evening i thought back to the time some years ago when i graduated from the academy and sat with my fellow cadets
4595786 the credit belongs to the one who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes short again and again who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions and spends themselves in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he or she fails at least fails while daring greatly
4595787 with a new title sponsor and site i expect the event will continue to be one of the favorites on the tour it is great for american tennis to see companies like mps group supporting the womens game
4595788 the knot in the pit of your stomach just makes me feel physically ill not knowing what to do
4595789 we went from a 9 9 interest rate which is still relatively high up to a 13 75
4595790 the mortgage is now 1 300 a month theres no way we can afford it with a 1 600 a month income and 4 kids its not doable
4595791 theres been a notice of the sheriff sent saying youre in foreclosure
4595792 i thought this is it its awful its probably the most depressing worthless feeling ive had in my whole life not being able to keep my own kids in their home
4595793 theres been a lot more people coming in to talk about financial worries
4595794 it causes a lot of depression and stress especially in men and men are reluctant to ask for help it can cause alcoholism or drug use as a way to escape it can be a huge thing especially when its your home at risk because your home is a big part of who you are
4595795 you cant get rid of clinical depression just by wishing it away
4595796 developing a plan is number one including a therapeutic plan to reduce the feelings of depression
4595797 that can involve them seeing their doctor and maybe going on medication that can help
4595798 children can sense that anxiety even if its not verbally expressed talk to them reassure them that things may be tough right now but were going to figure out a way to make it through
4595799 the mortgage company is reviewing our situation they finally noticed that this is an extreme situation and theyre going to see what they can do about lowering our payments
4595800 i got to the point where i just couldnt worry about it anymore it was doing more harm than good so i just took it one day at a time
4595801 dont think its going to go away because its not but there is help you just need to know where to look and dont give up
4595802 weve done this every year and i wanted to bring everyone back together
4595803 some anger is setting in when things are happening too slowly
4595804 people are still fighting with their insurance companies the kids arent together with their friends thats the really sad part but in other ways the community is stronger than ever
4595805 they have shown a great deal of courage since the storm some of them were hoping to get back into their homes before school started but for some it looks like it will be closer to halloween now
4595806 it is so nice to see all the neighbors and kids together again
4595807 we were always out together there must be 20 kids here and its great to see them playing together again
4595808 im supposed to be the dad and be brave but i get scared when i hear about bad weather
4595809 i had just loaded the grill with hamburgers when the storm hit
4595810 afterward we found the grill across the street in the neighbors yard and when we open it the hamburgers were still there
4595811 i lost my house and everything in it but the red cross was absolutely outstanding
4595812 they did everything right they got us shelter and food right after the storm i cant say enough good things about them the local businesses were right there too helping and donating food for everyone
4595813 there are two trees in my backyard that i always looked at and i was so glad they were still standing after the storm but the birch trees are shredded
4595814 we could use someone out here who knows something about replacing and planting trees
4595815 im glad to have everyone back tonight i hate the privacy
4595816 my kids have no playmates we are starting to see some rebuilding and some of our neighbors may be back in a few weeks
4595817 it has a flash light a battery powered radio first aid kit water playing cards and coloring books
4595818 national night out gives us a chance to hang out and see all our friends our kids arent really together much so tonight they can just have fun our community will come back stronger than ever
4595819 what i hope to gain is all the knowledge id need to be a person trainer this is something id like to practice to help others
4595820 its a competitive area right now when you look for jobs the more training you receive the better youll look in the eyes of an employer
4595821 with a six week training program it gives people hope that theyre going to be able to do something soon six weeks is not a bad time period in which to get a job
4595822 i see myself working one on one with individuals long into the future as long as im healthy i believe i can help others to be healthy as well
4595823 every man under my command owes me 100 nazi scalps and yall will git me one hundred nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead nazis or die trying
4595824 this is pop culture encountering nazi germany and the holocaust with unprecedented force the effects of this collision are unpredictable
4595825 all the german historians and critics who were left gasping for breath by tom cruise and his worthy attempts to produce a correct image of stauffenberg they will be so shocked by inglorious bastards they will savage it on the spot
4595826 this years awards show that australian performance writing is challenging thought provoking life changing and not afraid to push the boundaries
4595827 the strength of the spinwave wireless technology lies in its signal integrity over significant transmission distances
4595828 integrating spinwaves sensors with the dimax dcm provides building owners and managers with an important new option for integrating wireless sensors with their existing systems
4595829 integrating wireless energy management with other systems in a company makes it much easier for energy usage data to reach decision makers at all levels with everyone getting the information they need in the format they prefer
4595830 it seems to me that the united states has to have a darned good reason to break off relations with russia and go back to the dark days of the cold war
4595831 i dont believe events thus far provide that reason both sides need the other too much
4595832 we have never profited much by not talking to people with whom we dont have common ground
4595833 i have never believed we are very effective at trying to play the game of reward and punishment with a nation as big as russia
4595834 the missile defence deal with poland certainly raises the ante and i believe that the timing is anything but accidental
4595835 we should not take our eye off the immediate issue which is for the first time since the end of the soviet union russian troops have invaded and are occupying another country
4595836 but isolating russia is not really an option it will not be isolated it is too big it is too powerful
4595837 if for some reason or another the russians proceed with their occupation go to tbilisi and topple saakashvili then we are probably in a world where russia finds itself outside the community of nations and some type of militarized rivalry is likely to return

4595846 i think people are probably waiting the campaigns are probably trying to conserve their money and spend it when its most useful
4595847 you can have political signs on private property outside of any public property or any public right of way
4595848 in cases where we cant make that determination well pick the signs up and dispose of them
4595849 i think its a part of the process i think its important for people to get their message across and get their name out there if theyre running for office
4595850 theyre all out there promising you the world but what really counts is what happens after the election
4595851 dont quote us on this but were guessing that no qualifier for the batting title has had more stolen bases than runs scored since marquis grissom had 76 steals and 73 runs scored in 1991 taveras currently has 51 of each so he might accomplish a pretty rare feat

4595857 japanese customers will see deliveries in november this year but the infrastructure just isnt in place elsewhere in the world california already has five hydrogen fuelling stations with 20 expected by 2010 so its a great testing bed

4595859 the hydrogen production process does produce some emissions but even when this is taken into account we still expect to make significant cuts in overall co2 emissions we expect hydrogen fuel cell buses to produce 50 per cent less co2 than their diesel counterparts with that figure improving as even greener sources of hydrogen are developed

4595868 we appreciate the volunteers who worked so hard to build this home in only 18 weeks
4595869 thanks to winn dixie its customers and kellogg hard working families are attaining the american dream of owning their own home
4595870 every time we turn around were seeing empty packages thrown in the corner of the store and all and thats just stuff that were seeing stolen
4595871 he went over to the rod and reel combo and he went ahead and broke the reel off the rod and stole the actual fishing reel
4595872 everytime we turn around were getting reels stolen off the rods i mean i think weve had maybe twenty reels stolen this year im thinking around four thousand dollars just on fishing reels alone that were seeing stolen
4595873 when you have ten thousand plus items that customers come in and touch and grab its very hard to keep everything controllable so when you have a camera system like this you can go in and keep an eye on whats going on
4595874 the percentage of theft really raises prices for the consumers if we can keep the theft to a minimum it just helps keep the prices low for us
4595875 can execute its nuclear mission in a safe secure and reliable manner
4595876 ive had to concentrate as all schools have on making sure covered all the bases so everybody has what they need for graduation
4595877 i am in such a state it is all gone pear shaped
4595878 obviously if they knew the car wasnt going to start they would have thrown the caution you make the assumption as a sanctioning body that the cars will start up as well as i did but we had the battery becoming disconnected at times and that was the worst time for it sitting in the middle of the race track
4595879 i dont think the pit stop strategy ruined the race any more than how bad our car was handling or running at that particular part of the race
4595880 i was going backward as it was so it aint like we screwed ourselves on pit strategy the car wasnt that good we just kind of stayed out there longer than anybody else
4595881 it was fun to lead hell i didnt want to pit either you know what i mean i was leading the race that was fun
4595882 it was very very fast at the start of the race but that wasnt the car i had there the last half of that race i didnt have that good of car i dont think many people that are very critical of tony jr knew that
4595883 we just need to continue to build this is a deal that is still a work in progress
4595884 well keep thrashing on things and doing things at the shop that we need to do
4595885 this is one of our newest cars here its a lot lighter thats a step in the right direction rather than just trying to get to the race track every week just starting to build stuff and refine it and make it better if we can continue to do that during the remainder of the year and pick back up a little bit and start getting more consistent and finish out on a high note we can roll into daytona locked in the top 35 in owners points and go from there
4595886 this blog will provide context over the next 2 months with regular posts about the behind the scenes development of the release and continue through the release of the product

4595934 i not only felt i was blindsided by what was taking place but this board was acting not so much like a judge and jury but to me more like a kangaroo court
4595935 the actions of this board in looking to satisfy the concerns of the fire personnel on some comments i made at a brush fire at my residence have now become completely political in nature and represent little more than character assassination

4595947 the defect of knowing and self and of recognizably motivated emotion goes hand in hand with defects in planning in high level attention and in sustained and adequate behaviors

4595952 she detailed her marriage to guy in a way that a woman usually doesnt discuss her husband with her brother

4596006 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
4596007 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
4596008 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
4596009 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
4596010 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
4596011 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do

4596017 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
4596018 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
4596019 and the occasional movie that my parents wanted to see having never seen a bogart film at this point i recall being especially baffled by
4596020 which is actually a slightly better film than they made it out to be or argued passionately about things that they couldnt agree upon they taught me the numerous elements that went into the making of a film and helped me to determine which ones worked and which ones didnt
4596021 they did so in such a way that i could intellectually understand exactly where they were coming from even if i thought they were off their rockers while the show may have changed and evolved over the years i still miss
4596022 that had me drooling with anticipation it was the notion of these two individuals talking about film at length and without any sort of extraneous fluff that was at its heart and that is why it lasted as long as it did
4596023 and siskel berated ebert for recommending benji over kubrick will anyone debate film so passionately again

4596040 the dollar is on fire again so thats causing people to re evaluate everything
4596041 it means oil prices could fall dramatically we could see prices get to double digits if this continues
4596042 theyre basically saying we could have an oil glut because demand is slowing
4596043 its obvious that high prices do slow down demand and the market works

4596047 are like the kobe bryants of china they get lots of advertisements
4596048 given the pattern of the thing its not unreasonable for people to ask
4596049 the media and a large chunk of the public including some of johns supporters still question whether hes told the whole truth

4596053 i am confident that none of the documents have been released
4596054 i was shocked that something like this would occur i never dreamed it would i deeply regret that this happened
4596055 it was way out of reason the suspect in this case thought his information was worth a whole lot more it was more than you could by a steak with
4596056 based on what mr hudson and sheriff brown said it appears they nipped this so this information didnt get out
4596057 out of that 6 000 pages i am sure there is going to be information that isnt going to be admissable for whatever reason i think it is pretty fortunate on behalf of my client that they were able to stop this

4596085 i am sure every historian archaeologist and storyteller is as excited about this as i am
4596086 this announcement and the search for these two vessels has the allure of an indiana jones mystery
4596087 we certainly think that by establishing our long standing presence in the arctic that can enhance issues of sovereignty
4596088 his research has provided incredibly valuable insight that will help contribute greatly to this search
4596089 local inuit involvement has been absent in previous searches and it will undoubtedly be a key to a successful expedition this summer or next summer
4596090 for the first time in over 160 years i feel that the witnesses of the franklin tragedy events have a chance to really contribute to an important search party
4596091 theres information that has been shared about possible locations where there may be some materials relating to the franklin expedition
4596092 louis kamookak from gjoa haven has been instrumental in providing information about where it would be

4596095 i am pleased to be given the opportunity to continue what coach barta has started because he has laid a great foundation for scorpion baseball
4596096 his values and traditions will continue to be a model for our program we have a great group of young men coming back and i know they are all excited to get back on the field
4596097 we make clinical assessments order medications that take care of symptoms give emotional and spiritual support we switch hats ten times in one visit
4596098 it was just me and this woman who was dying right before my very eyes
4596099 within two weeks i knew this was it i knew this was what the lord has for me
4596100 i can mentor our nurses that are new to hospice more effectively going from home to home
4596101 ive told them stories throughout the years stories they didnt want to hear
4596102 i have to go in and be up for each one of them i discuss the signs of approaching death with three families in one day maybe with another yet to go i have to meet people right where they are
4596103 if you call me and you dont hear back from me in fifteen minutes you need to call the office
4596104 but i am their nurse not their family member after the patient dies im not going to be there
4596105 often people think that hospice is for old people with cancer
4596106 it is not it is for birth through one hundred and eight
4596107 if you wait until its too late its a scramble to get the symptoms managed and the patient dies before they can address the bigger things such as connecting with family and dealing with their own anger
4596108 they have worked hard and had their families and theyre looking forward to their retirement they have these plans and all of it is ripped out from under them
4596109 of people who are eligible for hospice probably one half of one percent use it
4596110 people dont cope well when they dont know the truth people want to know the truth they may say they dont but they do
4596111 i can lay it out for them but i must honor the parents
4596112 i walk into a home where there are kids and nephews
4596113 we teach them how to take care of their own like in every other country in the world in ethiopia they are poor and they dont have hospice they do it naturally as a way of life
4596114 people can pass from this world to the next with relatively little suffering
4596115 family can embrace them and have the opportunity to say things and to finalize and appreciate
4596116 the most common types are genetic testing for breast ovarian and colon cancer
4596117 there are lots of other very rare cancer symptoms we can test for such as hereditary melanoma and hereditary pancreatic cancer but those are the ones we see most often
4596118 generally speaking there are two reasons people come in for genetic testing
4596119 one they decide theres something they might do differently if it turns out theyre at a higher risk or two theyre worried about their family members a woman will come in because shes had a breast cancer diagnosis and shes worried about her daughter or her sister
4596120 less than 10 of cancers are caused by an inherited predisposition
4596121 a lot of people have this misconception that all cancer is hereditary which is almost the opposite of the truth and one of the biggest limitations of testing is that we dont know every gene under the sun a negative test result doesnt get anyone off the hook
4596122 we encourage people to think about whether this is information that will cause them a lot of psychological distress
4596123 or do they view it as empowerment this isnt going to be beneficial for everybody there are a lot of things to think about two people with the exact same medical history can make very different decisions about getting tested or very different decisions about what to do with the results
4596124 theres one response which is here i am feeling like this has been hanging over my head and now i feel relieved
4596125 or the reverse which is my test is positive but at least i know
4596126 if we learn that someones at an increased risk for cancer we can change their care
4596127 theres increased surveillance like mammograms in women who arent really old enough to get a mammogram then theres chemo prevention which is taking a medication like tamoxifen to lower the risk and the third thing people can do is preventative surgery
4596128 we work very closely with a clinical psychologist and shes been doing a study about the behavior of kids whose parents test positive
4596129 it causes them to change their lifestyle behaviors the two most common changes are they quit smoking and they start exercising
4596130 just because one family member wants genetic testing doesnt mean other members of the family want that information
4596131 if someone has a genetic predisposition a life insurance company may be able to ask for and use that information
4596132 one of the things i have said to people over the last year was that i will do everything i can to teach the kids about mental toughness
4596133 theyre all gonna deal with adversity in their lives every family does if i can model for them a little bit about how it works or what the deal is then ive helped them in a way thats well beyond basketball
4596134 no matter what happens we need to teach the kids how to function the right way how to behave the right way and i think thats what good coaches do
4596135 dave is like a father to all these kids this is like a family it goes way beyond basketball even before he got sick
4596136 i always have felt that the true test of what your team is like is what are they like at 30
4596137 have they become good fathers do they care about their kids are they good husbands thats really the set of values youre trying to teach them and trying to model for them
4596138 last year at the boardwalk classic we won our first game and then he went right to the hospital he was so weak
4596139 he stayed there overnight he basically ripped all his ivs out the next morning and came back to coach us the next afternoon
4596140 just because you have cancer doesnt mean you stop the rest of your life
4596141 coach told me once that he wanted his son to be like me
4596142 nous estimons que la premi re femme est tomb e malade et qualors plusieurs membres de sa famille se sont occup s delle restant dans la m me pi ce quelle
4596143 jusqu pr sent nous navions pas vraiment dempreinte digitale pour confirmer une transmission entre humains comme nous lavons eu ici
4596144 quand elle toussait ils taient tr s proches delle donc il y avait un contact rapproch dans une petite pi ce durant de longues heures
4596145 nous navons pas constat d volution dans la mutation du virus qui changerait la transmissibilit du virus il y a une l g re mutation mais tous les virus grippaux mutent sans cesse
4596146 the doctors are going to help me shrink it down
4596147 but the medicine that will shrink it will make my hair fall out imagine that moms going to be bald
4596148 youre a good mom and your kids arent so bad either
4596149 i never thought i would get united out of my system but this is a special club and it sucks you in these are special people and a special breed
4596150 one of the first things that struck me here was all these great ex players that are around the club
4596151 it is fantastic to meet them all graeme sharp peter reid kevin sheedy adrian heath derek mountfield kevin ratcliffe and going back further dave hickson
4596152 but there is a big gap between that bunch of players and now we need to start making our mark so that they start talking about us instead
4596153 if we could get into the top four that would be as big an achievement as anything i did at my previous club
4596154 we underachieved at times last season we got one point from 24 against the top four sides if we had won two of those games we may have broken through
4596155 there was some fatigue towards the end of last season we lost the momentum that was carrying us through
4596156 that is something we need to be prepared for if we want to play as many games again
4596157 paul left a big impression on me as a youngster because he is such a winner and nothing stands in his way
4596158 he went out to italy and made his mark when others didnt and that says everything for his determination
4596159 paul is probably the most determined player i have ever played with and i think it is fantastic blackburn have given the job to an englishman i do not think there are enough of us around
4596160 there has been a lot of negativity around but we are using that to our advantage
4596161 we have always had a small squad and never been blessed with 20 or 30 players the manager likes working with a small group and the players like that
4596162 sexy lady if you think youre sexy looking now maybe you need to get your eyes examined too
4596163 how could you forget to tell me that you didnt have a breast tania what have i been touching all this time
4596164 wow i dont have a breast news to me too
4596165 you must go on because what you are doing here today in front of these cameras will change many peoples lives allison for someone facing these same issues you will be their bible
4596166 you might be surprised at what is going to happen over the next two days
4596167 i cannot give you an answer because there isnt one
4596168 we have been trying to add to the squad but nothing has changed i have nothing else to say
4596169 berbatov is a fabulous player who would be a fine addition to any team
4596170 the thing is if manchester united sign a player it has to be a top player and that would be exciting for us all
4596171 obviously you can never have too many strikers although i dont actually think we need to improve on too much from last season
4596172 we do have to protect the old dinosaurs a little bit more but they are all fit guys
4596173 giggs endurance test was the best in the club this summer which is unbelievable i dont know what he is made of
4596174 he has never carried any weight either and has always looked after himself so he will play a lot of games for us
4596175 paul scholes is much the same as is gary neville there is plenty of football left in them as well
4596176 last time we reached the super cup i made the mistake of playing lazio with half a team because we had newcastle straight afterwards
4596177 but when i saw them celebrating i was angry they thought they had won the world cup
4596178 i have a scientific insight i develop a drug for that scientific insight or a new therapeutic approach you have to find the cancer patient who would respond to this drug and you have to deliver it to that cancer patient in a compassionate and reasonable way to see if you can get maximal response
4596179 from the 1970s until the early 1990s the mindset of basic cancer researchers was that cancer is so complex a process that a real solution cannot be found in our lifetimes and that basic cancer research must remain aloof from the clinic
4596180 pursue pure rigorous and non goal encumbered science to advance the understanding for some future generation that might find practical application feasible this became an ingrained mindset success in research meant protection from clinical concerns
4596181 had we had to depend on federal funding to do this wed never have been able to get it done
4596182 the process by which grants are submitted reviewed approved and funded is incredibly long and it reduces ideas to lowest common denominator approaches approaches that are innovative frequently dont get funded
4596183 it was actually the discovery of herceptin that shook the outmoded paradigm and started a rebirth of interest in doing both doing research and treating patients
4596184 given how stirring this story is what is incomprehensible to me is that there is still a prejudice in basic cancer science against practical applications its as though its 1943 and weve become so infatuated with the shiny advanced weapons we are developing that we have forgotten why we started developing them in the first place although i believe we can make very important headway in the clinic with the knowledge and technology available we cant take berlin with them
4596185 stand up to cancer is founded on the belief that there is an opportunity for an additional funding mechanism focused on using the knowledge and technology already in hand or just around the corner to address the cancer problem and utilizing approaches to funding that circumvent some of the shortcomings in current research support mechanisms
4596186 stated another way su2c believes that there are human beings who will benefit immensely if we are successful
4596187 ill find my daddy and bring him home to you
4596188 it is as if one world trade center tower were collapsing on our society every single day
4596189 everybody plays his individual part to perfection everybody does whats right by his own life and the total just doesnt work
4596190 the hallmark of a cancer cell is its genetic instability
4596191 that heterogeneity of tumors is the major major obstacle to easy therapy
4596192 i just think this is a very tough set of problems
4596193 i think hey in 30 years mankind went from being almost completely ignorant about how cancer arises to being pretty damn knowledgeable
4596194 we cannot wait for full understanding the 325 000 patients with cancer who are going to die this year cannot wait nor is it necessary in order to make great progress in the cure of cancer for us to have the full solution of all the problems of basic research
4596195 the history of medicine is replete with examples of cures obtained years decades and even centuries before the mechanism of action was understood for these cures from vaccination to digitalis to aspirin
4596196 if the goal is to cure cancer you dont incentivize people to have little publications
4596197 you get a paper where you change one gene ever so slightly and you have a drastic effect of cancer in the mouse and that paper gets published in science or nature and in your best journals that makes your reputation then you start getting grants based on that
4596198 open any major journal and 80 of it is mice or drosophila fruit flies or nematodes worms when do you get human studies in there
4596199 there are only pick a number say 30 000 genes they do only a finite number of things there are only a finite number of mechanisms that cancers have its a large number when i say finite i dont mean to trivialize it there may be 100 mechanisms that cancers are using but 100 is only 100
4596200 cancers by virtue of having mutations also acquire achilles heels rational cancer therapies are about finding the achilles heel associated with each new mutation in a cancer
4596201 one of the most frequently used experimental models of human cancer is to take human cancer cells that are grown in a petri dish put them in a mouse in an immunocompromised mouse allow them to form a tumor and then expose the resulting xenograft to different kinds of drugs that might be useful in treating people these are called preclinical models
4596202 and its been well known for more than a decade maybe two decades that many of these preclinical human cancer models have very little predictive power in terms of how actual human beings actual human tumors inside patients will respond
4596203 a fundamental problem which remains to be solved in the whole cancer research effort in terms of therapies is that the preclinical models of human cancer in large part stink
4596204 if you find a compound that cures hypertension in a mouse its going to work in people we dont know how toxic it will be but it will probably work
4596205 then they say ive got a model for lung cancer well it aint a model for lung cancer because lung cancer in humans has a hundred mutations
4596206 it looks like the most complicated thing youve ever seen genetically
4596207 if you look at the millions and millions and millions of mice that have been cured and you compare that to the relative success or lack thereof that weve achieved in the treatment of metastatic disease clinically
4596208 you realize that there just has to be something wrong with those models
4596209 99 of investigators in industry and in academia use xenografts
4596210 you can assess tumor size just by looking at it
4596211 if for no other reason than that hundreds of millions of dollars are being wasted every year by drug companies using these models
4596212 we probably lose a lot of things that either dont have activity on their own or we havent tried in the right setting or you dont identify the right target
4596213 is that the fda has created inertia because it continues to recognize these models as the gold standard for predicting the utility of drugs
4596214 i mean there is nothing known about that but somehow i cant interest people in funding this
4596215 its tough okay and individuals are not rewarded for doing tough things
4596216 are more comfortable with the focused heres an antibody i will use and heres blah blah blah blah and then i get the money
4596217 the accumulation of data gives people the illusion theyve done something meaningful
4596218 its efficacy stupid one of the major problems that we have is dealing with this meager degree of efficacy
4596219 we have a shortage of good ideas that are likely to work
4596220 system is likely to remain inefficient unresponsive and unduly expensive
4596221 very smart people with a lot of money have done trials of over 10 000 patients around the world testing these new molecular targeted drugs
4596222 astrazeneca tested iressa isis pharmaceuticals and eli lilly tested a compound called isis 3521 several different companies ended up investing tens of millions of dollars and all came up with a big goose egg
4596223 the heterogeneity will evolve from the surviving cells and say i dont give a rats ass you cant screw me up with this stuff suddenly youre squaring and cubing the complexity thats where we are
4596224 it becomes much more challenging in the context of managing the databases interpreting the results and owning the data
4596225 because each side wanted to own the rights to the combination
4596226 weve been stuck with this definition of what cancer is from 1890 its what i was taught in medical school its not cancer until theres invasion thats like saying the barn isnt on fire until there are bright red flames coming out of the roof
4596227 cardiovascular disease of course is nowhere near as complex as cancer is
4596228 all these people who are obsessed with cures cures cures and the miraculous cure which is still eluding us theyre being i hate to use this word but if you want to look at it pragmatically theyre being selfish by ignoring what could be done in terms of prevention
4596229 what our investment in biomedical research has led us to is understanding cancer as a disease process and the various steps and stages along that pathway from being very susceptible to it to the point where you get it and ultimately suffer and die from it
4596230 mission to prevent the process from occurring in the first place or detect the occurrence of cancer early enough to eliminate it with less morbidity
4596231 its going to require a community conversation to facilitate this change
4596232 i think everyone believes that at the end of the day cancer is going to be treated with multiple targeted agents maybe in combination with traditional chemotherapy drugs maybe not because thats where the biology is leading us its a future that we have to embrace though it will definitely require different models of cooperation
4596233 that enthusiasm is very much tempered by the fact that we have 40 000 women dying of breast cancer every year um and you know ive got a file full of letters that are almost entirely from family members of my patients who died
4596234 my excuse initially was that if anyone wanted to say i was a bad doctor id hold on to these things that people said about me and i could prove that i wasnt
4596235 why were losing the war on cancer and how to win it
4596236 nous estimons que la premi re femme est tomb e malade et qualors plusieurs membres de sa famille se sont occup s delle restant dans la m me pi ce quelle
4596237 jusqu pr sent nous navions pas vraiment dempreinte digitale pour confirmer une transmission entre humains comme nous lavons eu ici

4596240 your dog is ruining my drinking water also i have nothing better to do than worry about dog poop
4596241 thats right i didnt think of that when i used it in the song though first it caught my attention in the work of joseph beuys an artist i really admire an image from a totally different corner came after that namely from the bible somewhere in there is the saying out of the strong comes forth the sweet i felt it said something essential about my music the soft the sweet but not weak that comes from the strong in england there are pots of honey with that saying and an old drawing of a sleeping lion with a cloud of bees above him that saying does have the same ambiguous meaning in relation to sperm i wont deny that the ambiguous meaning began to play a part in the song but mostly honey is a symbol for something organic soft and vital
4596242 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring
4596243 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry
4596244 inconsistencies and inadequacies which limit the interpretations of the findings
4596245 for this to come out on a friday afternoon just before california takes action it definitely raises some eyebrows

4596253 having too many first party games on your console is bad
4596254 my personal opinion and based on my opinion of the christian faith thats not the type of expression a presidential candidate or anyone following the christian faith ought to make
4596255 helps to juxtapose the dna of sen obama with dna of sen mccain
4596256 at the end of the day again i think the american public deserves full revelation of the candidates character and competences
4596257 many in the christian community have not forgotten sen mccain leaving his first wife for his second wife one month after a disfiguring car accident
4596258 these smears on john mccains character and faith expose the utter hypocrisy of barack obamas claim to represent a new kind of politics its disgraceful
4596259 know that john mccains faith and character were tested and forged in ways few can fathom

4596264 but i want all of you any time youll spend working on this lecture is wasted time because its time away from the kids and from me
4596265 hes a workaholic i know just what hell be like when he starts putting the lecture together itll be all consuming
4596266 this lecture will be the last time many people i care about will see me in the flesh

4596270 at five i suppose that dylan will grow up to have a few memories of me but how much will he really remember what do you and i even remember from when we were five will dylan remember how i played with him or what he and i laughed about it will be hazy at best
4596271 and how about logan and chloe they may have no memories at all nothing especially chloe and i can tell you this when the kids are maybe twelve or thirteen theyre going to go through this phase where they absolutely achingly need to know who was my dad what was he like this lecture could help give them an answer to that
4596272 ill get you a dvd when the kids are older you can show it to them itll help them understand who i was and what i cared about
4596273 if you have things you want to say to the kids or advice you want to give them why not just put a video camera on a tripod and tape it here in the living room
4596274 is that when parents tell children things it doesnt hurt to get some external validation if i can get an audience to laugh and clap at the right time maybe that would add gravitas to what im telling the kids

4596286 for me its a dream have be in this final
4596287 when i arrived here i didnt expect be in the final i was very tired with a lot of matches and not playing my best tennis

4596293 geopolitical concerns and the realisation that global slowdown concerns are behind the slump in commodities are acting as an offset of sorts that is restraining buying interest at this juncture
4596294 the softening economic situation has led to a further slowdown in oil demand growth
4596295 falling commodity prices and a stronger dollar have supported the market but the mood on a summer friday is cautious
4596296 as for the markets equity investors who are actually looking into the future should be buoyed by this report and with oil continuing to collapse the stars are starting to align at least for next year
4596297 this story and others triggered more discussions about how we all got here how our ancestors got here and how others in our communities got here essentially how toronto was and is being shaped by movement
4596298 members of our collective each have a unique movement story to tell whether it is the experience of being a refugee a second generation canadian an indigenous canadian who has moved to toronto from ancestral homelands or a person who has lived both in toronto and back home our motivations for being in toronto are all different and reflect both the values that we learned from our families and our own aspirations as artists and individuals
4596299 the issue that we are concerned with is the issue of forgetting where we come from often we choose to or are forced to forget important aspects of our getting here stories forgetting happens for a lot of different reasons but always the outcome is a loss of sense of self a loss of ability to self identify with a culture we expect to reflect experiences of toronto back to our audiences and to affirm and highlight the many meaning of movement and the centrality of movement to the lives of people living in toronto that includes everyone not just immigrants

4596330 in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it the purpose of missile defense is to protect our european allies from any rogue threats such as a missile from iran
4596331 we are worried that we are facing under the strong arm of russia a situation where some kind of understanding would be reached that russia would be given a free hand in the region
4596332 fue muy lindo poder saludar y charlar con diego que tiene un magnetismo impresionante la verdad es que fue espectacular el encuentro le gust mucho el regalo que le hicimos de parte del equipo y me result impresionante su humildad y su buena onda
4596333 we would like to know whether it is humanitarian or military
4596334 no destruction the georgian side had been depicting so colorfully could be seen
4596335 we have been saying all along that gori is not a position at all at which russian troops could have fired with heavy weapons or armaments
4596336 my records were made originally by black musicians for black grown ups
4596337 berry gordy made music by black musicians for white teenagers i envied him at atlantic we had to slug away pray for a crossover we didnt get too many
4596338 i never loved a man the way i love you
4596339 theres been a huge number of bad headlines generated about russia in the last couple months
4596340 and im not surprised that that spooks investment banks in london or new york
4596341 clearly russia does not look good in the western eyes with the georgia operation
4596342 anyone who is familiar with the scene here does not see it as completely new
4596343 moving in and out of markets shouldnt be taken lightly
4596344 theres no question that youve got to stand back and think about what the implications are not for just next week but two years from now
4596345 we have to prove that we are one of the best teams in the conference
4596346 our goal is to make it to the ncaa tournament and we have put together a strong non conference schedule to prepare ourselves for big east play and a tournament berth
4596347 our most urgent task today is the immediate and orderly withdrawal of russian armed forces and the return of those forces to russia
4596348 all russian troops and any irregular and paramilitary forces that entered with them must leave immediately
4596349 grew up with the idea that it should never happen again
4596350 the people of georgia have cast their lot with the free world and we will not cast them aside
4596351 unfortunately russia has tended to view the extension of freedom and democracy as a threat to its interests
4596352 we can only regret that at this very difficult time the u s side is further aggravating relations between the u s and russia
4596353 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4596354 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia this is about getting russian troops out
4596355 they want to paralyze the country as long as they can
4596356 they are putting everything in a nonusable condition and taking what they want
4596357 weve been trying to convince the general to let the police in
4596358 they take that as a threat and they said to either stop these cars or they will bomb them
4596359 would equip the separatist army in a pretty impressive way
4596360 they were telling us that they were not going to kill the old people but now they are killing the old people too
4596361 delete trailing whitespace if i am the author of this file
4596362 from these proofs and authorities and from many others it is manifest that the most blessed mother of god has been assumed above the choirs of angels and this we believe in every way to be true
4596363 we dont recognize the city of chicago or its police as a legitimate

4596368 not only is tropic thunder guaranteed to offend it already has one of the mock films it references simple jack and its story of a developmentally challenged young person who talks to animals uses the tag line once upon a time there was a retard this has so upset advocacy groups that news reports say a coalition of them is intending to call for a nationwide boycott to protest the movies open ridicule of the intellectually disabled but it would be regrettable if tropic thunders undeniable excesses including having an actor indulge in the 21st century version of blackface blinded viewers to the reality that like it or not there is genuine humor and palpable satiric intent underneath the waves of unnerving bad taste and political incorrectness
4596369 the scene in which the derisive alpa chino brandon t jackson nails lazarus recitation of black uplift homilies as nothing more than the lyrics to the jeffersons theme is funny but the one in which lazarus quietly explains to speedman that his simple jack character failed because he made the mistake of going full retard rather than softening his character with cuteness in the manner of forrest gump is so on the nose accurate it takes your breath away
4596370 a coalition of disability advocate groups is organizing a boycott of tropic thunder based on what they see as the offensiveness of the simple jack gags but comedy needs the right to be offensive and stiller at least has the courage of his convictions when he uses the word retard its deliberate not casual
4596371 the films repeated use of a slur against the mentally disabled has led to calls for a boycott of the film by some who consider it to be hate speech but the films real target is hollywood and the tropes stereotypes and clich s it uses to pander to the lowest common denominator and which are applied here with the same intent but with tongue firmly planted in cheek
4596372 i am making fun of an actor and his misplaced oscar aspirations
4596373 my auntie works with the mentally retarded so if this movie was offensive shed know it she thinks its hilarious
4596374 i am sure every historian archaeologist and storyteller is as excited about this as i am
4596375 this announcement and the search for these two vessels has the allure of an indiana jones mystery
4596376 we certainly think that by establishing our long standing presence in the arctic that can enhance issues of sovereignty
4596377 his research has provided incredibly valuable insight that will help contribute greatly to this search
4596378 local inuit involvement has been absent in previous searches and it will undoubtedly be a key to a successful expedition this summer or next summer
4596379 for the first time in over 160 years i feel that the witnesses of the franklin tragedy events have a chance to really contribute to an important search party
4596380 theres information that has been shared about possible locations where there may be some materials relating to the franklin expedition
4596381 louis kamookak from gjoa haven has been instrumental in providing information about where it would be
4596382 the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war
4596383 one of the nicest places in the world to live in
4596384 hard to know whats more bizarre the fact that this is indeed the reuters headline or the fact that the mccain campaign is flogging it
4596385 it came up on the floor clayton county was certainly not the only reason why the bill passed but it certainly is an example of families that can benefit from the tax credit
4596386 theres a lot of pent up demand for greater educational opportunities
4596387 we definitely want to help children with the greatest financial need
4596388 i think this is the best thing that could have ever happened to parents like me who wanted the best opportunities for their kids but unfortunately cant afford it without assistance
4596389 recently my website and projects were censored in china which was unfortunate since im passonate about showing that there is a lot more happening here than than the well known realities of economic development and the olympics
4596390 they are starting to become more confident as they get to know each other a little better
4596391 they are also picking up on the drills we are running in practice a lot faster which is good
4596392 we have got to have someone that can put the ball down i think we can hang with anyone defensively having lara newberry anchoring the back row but we have got to have someone that can transition and put the ball down

4596400 scoop i found to be a trivial little kleenex of a film amusing provided you like me and you like scarlett johansson but its not worth much in the scheme of things if youre not doing anything on a hot afternoon and you want to get into the air conditioning you can watch it
4596401 cassandras dream i thought was a good picture that people have not flocked to in any quantity at all but i thought it was a completely engrossing movie brilliantly acted by everybody and i was very satisfied with it much more satisfied than with other films of mine that have been much bigger successes
4596402 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4596403 georgia last week launched a military incursion into south ossetia to rout separatist rebels russia which supports the separatists responded the next day sending tanks across the border into south ossetia the conflict quickly spread to other parts of georgia and to abkhazia another breakaway region
4596404 i feel like i should have been up every round and every round was tied
4596405 i felt like the scoring wasnt right because i worked so hard for this and to come this far and lose in the first round it isnt right it doesnt seem real to me
4596406 canada will now embark on its own journey on the search for these two vessels which has the allure of an indiana jones mystery
4596407 the franklin expedition is a key part of canadas history of arctic exploration as canada is once again asserting ourselves and protecting our sovereignty in the high arctic this expedition will provide important new information and will add to the body of research on the fate of these ships
4596408 we have staked our claim its use it or lose it for far too long our country has not had a strong presence in the far north

4596423 by putting the emphasis on independence we take our eye off the really important ball which is to achieve things for wales in the here and now
4596424 we need to be getting things right in the short term
4596425 rather than becoming too concerned about the wonderful place over there
4596426 according to which if you give the assembly greater powers you are inevitably on a slippery slope to independence
4596427 be shared by many of the older generation in the party
4596428 we need to create a new generation of nationalists we do that through presenting clear arguments as to why our vision of an independent wales offers the greatest opportunity for social progress and prosperity

4596435 its a real problem to find them a place to live
4596436 people end up living under bridges or in cars we would prefer they have a roof over their heads
4596437 for people to say this isnt a priority because its based on the possibility of harm is just wrong
4596438 for the most part these people have done their time
4596439 were better off educating students and preparing them to take accountability for their own public security
4596440 i think its just a knee jerk reaction to a problem that doesnt exist its going to make things 10 times worse
4596441 i think student safety should be a top priority for all schools
4596442 that keeping our children safe from sexual predators in the 21st century can best be achieved by ensuring that local national and international police cooperate across borders and across the digital divide worldwide

4596478 because of the snowfall people are more apt to see tracks and theres not the vegetation in the winter as in spring and fall so the tracks are a lot more visible

4596486 however they are able to step outside of their friendships on the court and challenge each other to play at the highest level the newcomers really have taken advantage of the experience of the seniors and the juniors and have fit right in
4596487 brittney and tania have really come in and done outstanding jobs so far and have surpassed the expectations we had for them
4596488 im very proud of the effort both of them have shown so far

4596539 estimates suggest that lifting the ban on deep water energy exploration could generate trillions of dollars in royalties that could then be invested in alternative energy technology

4596581 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4596582 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4596583 unless pursuant to the written regulations or written authorization of the institution

4596591 i know that before i can win your vote i have to win your respect
4596592 there is very little enthusiasm for mccain with people i network with
4596593 his voting record on social conservative issues for the most part is good
4596594 it is a matter of enthusiasm he is a hard guy to get enthusiastic about and why i just dont know
4596595 he hasnt done anything to offend hes just ignored them and they dont like to be ignored
4596596 i think if he wants to re create the intensity that has been within the base in the last two election cycles which i think personally you are going to need to win i think he has to make social issues a part of his political portfolio that he talks about
4596597 our belief is that during the remainder of the general election we will be able to make a compelling case as to why people of faith and christians in this country do have very compelling reasons to vote for and support john mccain
4596598 beyond the choice of his running mate sen mccains comments raise questions about the type of individuals he would appoint to other important positions like hhs secretary and even judgeships
4596599 as it becomes clearer and clearer that a barack obama administration would be a disaster the numbers will be there
4596600 i think it would be to his advantage to speak more to those kinds of voters and when i think he does that he always does very well
4596601 i think we will see him do more of that as we go through this year

4596604 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4596605 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4596606 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4596607 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4596608 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4596655 i am usually an optimist regarding the tropics and never try to overplay the storms but i dont like this one because if it stays farther away from cuba it may have some more warm water fuel
4596656 this one needs to be monitored closely because changes in the forecast are very possible as of right now lets plan on the worst weather monday night and all day tuesday
4596657 quickly spin up as it moves away from the mountainous islands and over an area of warm water and reduced wind shear
4596658 the options are wide open as long as the system remains unorganized
4596659 the storm is moving slowly because of the interaction with the mountains of puerto rico and hispaniola a slow moving system will track toward florida or the eastern gulf of mexico if the system picks up speed it could turn east of florida and head toward the carolinas
4596660 i am fairly confident that the system will not have an adverse effect on the primary citrus growing area in the middle of the state in fact the storm is much more likely to bring beneficial rain rather than damaging wind
4596661 some of these conditions include reduced wind shear weaker trade winds an active west african monsoon system the winds coming off of africa and warmer than average water in the atlantic ocean
4596662 typically when you have strong activity during july thats also a very strong indicator the remainder of the season will be above normal

4596665 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4596666 to begin repairing relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must respect the freedom of its neighbors
4596667 we are hopeful that we can continue cooperation with the russians
4596668 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4596669 moscow must honor its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4596670 in the years since its gained independence after the soviet unions collapse georgias become a courageous democracy
4596671 its people are making the tough choices that are required of free societies since the rose revolution in 2003 the georgian people have held free elections opened up their economy and built the foundations of a successful democracy
4596672 the people of georgia have cast their lot with the free world and we will not cast them aside
4596673 they village officials supposedly want to clean up the borders
4596674 they were denied because they were trying to live in a conservation and recreation district
4596675 they showed a callous disregard for the needs of the handicapped
4596676 things just didnt work out thats all i can tell you
4596677 were all happy we were able to figure this out within the first four months instead of dragging it out over four years
4596678 now its all over and we can all move on i sincerely wish daniel nothing but the best in life and i hope he feels the same toward the district
4596679 i love this community and my family does too so we hope to stay in the community for a long time
4596680 my two children start school in indian prairie unit district 204 in just over a week and were excited about that
4596681 this is a situation where daniel and the board realized that they did not see eye to eye on the basic direction of the park district and how it should be managed there is no one event that caused this realization but rather a series of things over the past few months
4596682 betts recognized that the board had the right to an executive director with whom it saw eye to eye the board recognized the fact that daniel had relocated his wife and two young children to naperville from denver and that once he left the park district finding another comparable job would likely be difficult
4596683 that woman is incredible but its not fair to her
4596684 id really like to see someone come in and give that woman a break if we had two mindys that would be great
4596685 as much as naperville likes to make fun of the park district we are still one of the most outstanding districts out there
4596686 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike
4596687 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4596688 i think the russian behavior over the last several days is generally concerning not only to the united states but to all of our european allies
4596689 i never meat to hurt my son i really never meant to do it
4596690 this appears to be a great tragedy from everybodys standpoint
4596691 as the states population grows and use of outdoor recreational areas increases we must be sure were doing everything we can to protect all users
4596692 itd probably be good to have a couple around for spares
4596693 the bottom line is that youre getting rid of the stuff
4596694 most cities are strange in the sense that periodically we have very unique things to get rid of
4596695 luckily the internet is making it easier for us to find these things a home
4596696 we didnt know what to do they weighed about five tons they were just huge
4596697 there were rumors for a while that michael jackson had expressed interest in them in bringing them down to neverland
4596698 traditionally cities are very good at buying things and not very good at getting rid of them
4596699 in this case we were able to reach a really big audience we had bids on the slide from canada and california

4596712 america is in great difficulty and we are experiencing enormous economic challenges as well as others
4596713 the situation on the ground in georgia is deteriorating sparking a significant movement of population
4596714 the capabilities to protect our populations against the effects of war could also be used to protect them against the effects of disasters as early as 1953 following disastrous north sea floods nato had an agreed disaster assistance scheme by 1958 the north atlantic council had established procedures for nato coordination of assistance between member countries in case of disasters

4596728 i have really enjoyed the summer so far from a personal point of view
4596729 the competition now is pretty healthy as we have five bowlers with stuart broad fred
4596730 on top of that you have all the guys in county cricket and simon jones coming back its all healthy and keeps you on your toes
4596731 so im not sure if i think i belong there in the team but if i can keep putting in the performances and keep taking wickets and if i can do as much as i can to impress the selectors they wont be able to leave me out
4596732 consistency is something i have been striving for and the confidence i have got from my consistency and the wickets ive taken this summer has been great
4596733 the one thing that has pleased me more than anything is the way i have kept my speeds up as i have bowled quite a lot of overs this summer
4596734 i have not been used to bowling this many overs in a summer so keeping my speeds up in the mid eighties and sometimes a bit more is encouraging
4596735 you cant fail to notice the advertising all around the ground it really lets you know about it
4596736 considering the tournament takes place on the sub continent the selection committee has opted for two spinners
4596737 having a left and right arm option in robin peterson and johan botha gives the selectors the variation theyre looking for
4596738 we strongly believe that success for windows 7 includes an open and honest and two way discussion
4596739 the windows hardware engineering conference the following week represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7
4596740 and windows vista had driven client revenue to an average growth rate of 16 percent since it became generally available
4596741 the biggest problem vista has today is in perception a perceived lack of value and perceived instability
4596742 its hard to come up with gee whiz features for a relatively mature product but security and improved manageability and ease of deployment especially from the standpoint of ecosystem support will certainly help improve microsofts chances
4596743 to enable standard users to be able to install known good apps and prevent administrators from running known bad apps
4596744 while it is disappointing not to have ricky ponting available we are confident continuing his recovery and missing this series will assure ricky is ready for the demanding cricket schedule ahead for the australian team
4596745 i am now recognising in both the one dayers and the tests i am one of the more senior players and that i need to go out and play like that
4596746 its an exciting thing for me to be seen as one of the senior players and to go out there and have a responsibility to deliver its a role im looking forward to having for a while to try to lead by example
4596747 its something i want to do as i have played enough test matches i have made a switch in the batting order from five to three and there is an opportunity to cement my place
4596748 it has been like that in the one dayers for a while and it is something i have enjoyed and i have been able to be very vocal in team meetings
4596749 hopefully it will be the same in the test matches and my performances against south africa the form team in world cricket show i have improved this summer i am desperate for that to continue
4596750 the ability is in the dressing room to win the ashes i dont think anyone would doubt that
4596751 the one thing we need to do as a side which we havent done too well is to be consistent
4596752 we scored almost 600 at lords and then followed that up by scoring 200 twice in the first innings of the next two tests when you are playing australia or south africa you cant do that its too big a gap to come back into games
4596753 so i agree with kevin that we have the players to win the ashes but it is up to us to get that consistency back it is no good being hot one day and cold the next

4596845 naturally the common people dont want war but after all it is the leaders of a country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders this is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in every country

4596857 yup its a follow up to guitar hero on tour for the ds
4596858 we were crying you ask why her but theres no answer you dont know what to say and it hits you hard it was a horrible feeling you cry and think the worst it brought us even closer together
4596859 she had to go through radiation and chemotherapy that was really tough on her and hard to watch
4596860 i still think about it and make sure she has check ups regularly
4596861 i think about the fact that we had it and beat it that was a very tough time
4596862 when you live through something like that you need to talk about it
4596863 maybe you were left here to help people or help an organization theres a reason why things happen and ive been fortunate id say stay upbeat and very positive about things any way i can help someone id be glad to do it
4596864 when they drop that big c on you i dont know too many people who dont start thinking about things
4596865 its scary i dont care who you are you realize how short of time you have on earth we take a lot for granted i was lucky that they caught it early and cleaned me out good
4596866 i think they see someone pop up on the board with prostate cancer and think maybe i better go in for a checkup
4596867 cancer hasnt touched my family directly fortunately but i have kids now and we have to realize how lucky and blessed we are to be playing baseball
4596868 for someone less fortunate if they want to come to a game for us not to make that happen would be ridiculous its part of our responsibility
4596869 for us its about creating that awareness and showing theres a need in these communities
4596870 for the communities to support these camps it helps kids deal with their grief
4596871 theres been many players either ex teammates or opponents who have gotten involved youre hoping to make the communities that we work and play in better places and allowing these kids the opportunities to deal with their issues and move forward in their lives having them understand that theyre not alone through this process and they can positively remember the person or persons that they lost is the right thing to do
4596872 i remember when the doctor told me i was cancer free
4596873 i probably laughed i also heard a doctor say that i wasnt going to make it during his bout with diverticulitis and one nurse said do you ever think he gave up and accepted the fact that hes going to die when she said that i rose up and stared at her i wasnt ready
4596874 should i give 10 or should i tell 10 friends
4596875 more times in everyday conversation than they are the word
4596876 all the best bits of fantasy with all the crap bits taken out
4596877 the only way i will know i have really survived breast cancer is when i die of something else
4596878 i told him on the phone and he was just silent
4596879 it was one of those things where you tell somebody bad news and they just think about it he didnt say anything for a couple of seconds i explained it to him pretty well about the treatment and everything about it
4596880 but the silence is the worse part because you dont know what to say you dont know what hes thinking you know that hes probably thinking the worst
4596881 april 2 was the one year anniversary of his second cancer
4596882 and it was just amazing what he has been through how far he has grown and the maturity that he has shown i think he understands how much hes grown up in the two years that hes had cancer
4596883 the first time i met him he said he was proud to just be a teammate with me considering what ive gone through
4596884 it was awkward just to hear that because i have so much respect for him
4596885 i just wanted to let him know not just because of my daughter and family experience
4596886 even just as an athlete you recognize how many battles youve been through and how hard you have to work to get to his point battling cancer on top of everything he is to be commended and i wanted to let him know thats how i felt
4596887 i try to downplay the cancer as much as i can
4596888 in the world of cancer the cancer i had i wasnt too deathly ill especially talking to people who have had chemo and different forms of treatment that are way worse than what i had to go through i just try to tell them theyre even stronger than i am
4596889 its a situation where it is cancer and its something that i probably will have to deal with the rest of my life whether its check ups or treatment but its one of those things where its crazy to hear different stories from people with cancer what some other people have gone through and survived
4596890 whatever fits into my schedule im willing to do it
4596891 it was like what the hell is going on what kind of karma is it that we have to keep going through this again theres this energy in life and it keeps messing with you but that makes you stronger that makes you grow and you understand the importance of and value of life
4596892 i know somebody in my position theyre not going to do what i did coming back to play in the same season im sure about that god gave me this opportunity to come back and i came back i know i can sleep and say i did my best
4596893 it just knocks you out youre in a state of mind where youre thinking about it every moment im thinking whats going to happen what am i supposed to do
4596894 about ten times a month somebody will come up to me and talk to me about cancer
4596895 its pretty common with me having prostate cancer and coby having the cancer standing up to cancer comes in a lot of different packages i think were all concerned we all want to help be part of the solution
4596896 cancer has been federally funded but its at a very minimal level compared to the amount of money that is spend on cancer and the treatment of cancer
4596897 it just seems like the ledger is out of balance my feeling is that the government should have a national campaign to fight cancer maybe a ten year campaign to find cures and to research and to attack all cancers
4596898 we can show that we have a good attitude and we show people that were kicking cancer in the butt
4596899 i was thinking about it the other day that 14 months ago i was under the knife
4596900 i dont feel like an inspiration but hopefully i am to some people because we all do think my story is unique the cancer is part of it but its not the whole story it just shows that a lot of hard work and perseverance is necessary everything doesnt always go your way there were a lot of roadblocks in my way but if you really want something youve got to stay focused on it

4596913 if you flood people with noise and move towards them it increases their physical threat as the brain is subjected to a multi sensory impact
4596914 this does not evoke sympathy because there is acute threat and instead the reflective part of the brain is shutdown and you cant reason that it is not real
4596915 the extreme noise causes the brain to feel confused and i know some people who would be tipped over the edge from this show your reaction has been similar to that of a trauma victim

4596927 our findings are particularly relevant for neurodegenerative disorders such as parkinsons and alzheimers
4596928 many of these diseases are due to misbehaving or damaged proteins that accumulate in neurons by preventing this decline in protein clearance we may be able to keep these people free of symptoms for a longer time
4596929 that was enough to maintain a clean liver and to prove that if you keep your cells clean they work better
4596930 she has single handedly shown that lysosome function is a crucial part of the ageing process
4596931 my ideal intervention in the future would be a better diet rather than a pill
4596932 itd probably be good to have a couple around for spares
4596933 the bottom line is that youre getting rid of the stuff
4596934 most cities are strange in the sense that periodically we have very unique things to get rid of
4596935 luckily the internet is making it easier for us to find these things a home
4596936 we didnt know what to do they weighed about five tons they were just huge
4596937 there were rumors for a while that michael jackson had expressed interest in them in bringing them down to neverland
4596938 traditionally cities are very good at buying things and not very good at getting rid of them
4596939 in this case we were able to reach a really big audience we had bids on the slide from canada and california
4596940 the most heinous act of terror since that time amy peed on a fire hydrant
4596941 i see this as an example of an employer not so subtly pressuring workers to either hide their political beliefs or to falsify them for the benefit of their employers
4596942 wal mart rejects the suggestion that they are telling associates how to vote but as i point out in my book one of the biggest employee free speech concerns is the chill that employer pressure to conform can place on worker free expression
4596943 whether or not this turns out to amount to a technical violation of federal election commission rules it is sophistry to suggest that this kind of message from an employer doesnt have a chilling effect on the political and expressive rights of these employees its possible that they could find themselves disadvantaged if they express political views that happen to differ from those of a powerful corporate employer
4596944 georgians speak a south caucasian language not the east slavic language spoken by the russians and possess a very different alphabet from the cyrillic
4596945 they accepted christianity in 330 ad 650 years before the east slavs did they belong to the eastern orthodox christian community as does russia they possess an ancient culture and are proud of their history

4596947 basically what we found is that things are more complicated than previously thought
4596948 our study shows that there is a large genetic component to caste determination but that there is also a very strong environmental component
4596949 flexibility in caste determination is essential as it allows the colony to respond to changes in need or environmental fluctuations
4596950 differences in the nutrition that an individual assimilated during larval growth are strong predictors of caste
4596951 but there are still haves and have nots in the colony those genetic variants who have a reproductive advantage and those that dont
4596952 the history of all past society has consisted in the development of class antagonisms the exploitation of one part of society by the other

4596976 people living together should not assume that they will automatically have the same rights as married couples or civil partners in court there is no such thing as a common law marriage
4596977 before you are at the stage where you start living together make sure you know your rights
4596978 it feels stupid to be in chemotherapy and be smoking
4596979 the reason this is happening to me is because of the bad choices i made as a teenager
4596980 obviously these decisions have to be weighed against your prognosis and how much time you have have you had that conversation with doctor x
4596981 this guy was just starting he had a fire in his belly was excited about the subject and just turned me on to this whole idea of biology and biologic processes and what it meant and its sort of secrets and the questions of life itself
4596982 what genes if any would be altered and if they are altered do they play a role and how would you prove that
4596983 how much more will learning about this pathway or the nth degree of this pathway give us
4596984 you said there was going to be something different wheres the beef
4596985 youre probably right i bet theyll have lots of water i bet your buddy has water and hell want to share it i bet well find that to be the case if he has a spigot i used to drink water
4596986 water comes in bottles now or it doesnt come at all
4596987 makes no difference if he is a hound better quit kicking my dog around
4596988 then the first right turns into a dirt road after a mile
4596989 then its virgin forest we have to machete our way through did you bring a machete

4596993 please leave those poor people alone they come in peace
4596994 are you kidding thanks for bringing him out were not exactly on the way to anywhere
4596995 this is the boondocks tony off the map beyond the beyond the country was about ten miles that away
4596996 dont worry about it we miss him and everything but it was eight years ago now and you know or maybe you dont after eight years of being gone its kind of like he never existed in the first place
4596997 well he seemed fine healthiest man i ever knew turned out he had a congenital heart defect though and one day bam he just keeled over eight years ago like i said and the only time i think about him now is when i go out back and weed the graveyard thought of him tonight in fact
4596998 yeah its cool ill show it to you if you want found it when we bought the place and cleared away the underbrush some of the gravestones go all the way back to the seventeen hundreds thought newt might as well go there too pre hallowed ground and all
4596999 you want some iced tea or something coffee for the drive back
4597000 i mean no thanks i should be getting back i guess
4597001 sure and if i get lost ill just ask somebody the way to civilization
4597002 he my dead husband said itd take a hundred years for the rest of the world to get here by which time we would be dead and it wouldnt matter he was right about that at least the dead part
4597003 oh man whenever the electricity at our house goes out jasper freaks he cant watch television he cant play his precious video games which i imagine is what theyre doing as we speak
4597004 look what i found under newtons bed the other day
4597005 i mean you know its going to happen one day and its cool and everything but when it happens its a shock
4597006 to say the least jasper has never shown the slightest interest in girls
4597007 newton has a little he likes to irritate them which is good practice for later in life
4597008 looked like there might have been ten or more i left them there
4597009 yeah but also because this one features jessica alba i love her she does a swimsuit thing in this issue page forty seven
4597010 i hate living like this i hate it seriously im sorry you have to see it at all that anybody does luckily not too many people do but its hard sometimes you know
4597011 come on tony im sure your home is nothing like this
4597012 i didnt think so this takes the cake i feel like ive become martha stewart if martha stewart died and came back eviler than she already probably is and did the opposite of everything she ever did when she was alive
4597013 it just completely drains you of everything every ounce of strength inside and out they tell you it will but then of course you think youll be able to withstand it to keep going the way you were before when the cancer was there but not being treated which when you think about it is weird i felt fine before i started getting the cure
4597014 hello the pictures of jessica alba in the magazine i stole from my son
4597015 i really dont know why i like her so much
4597016 but why does anybody like anybody people are just drawn to other people for some reason right this one where shes on all fours covered in sand its sexy but its also fun shes just a sexy girl having fun oh i dont even know what i mean
4597017 i like it when men say exactly what they want
4597018 i know thats the whole problem with this culture and all that bullshit but i do
4597019 but she doesnt really look like that its all airbrushed
4597020 but you cant airbrush those breasts those lips that incredible body the one good thing about the chemo is that ive actually gotten close to my ideal body weight
4597021 fat i was fat seriously ive lost thirty seven pounds in two months diets never worked for me before this one i like food too much maybe i should write a book
4597022 its a great idea brilliant on the cancer diet you can eat what you want because you dont want to eat and when you do eat more often than not youll throw it up its perfect with cancer we can all be as beautiful as jessica alba
4597023 he didnt think it was important the day he was born
4597024 i actually think he was embarrassed dying as young as he did he didnt want people to know
4597025 fight to make life easier for families who are going through what you went through
4597026 she says go hang out with the guy in room 217 until im done because hes a lot of fun
4597027 and she was right lots of times after that a whole bunch of us would go visit paul after work
4597028 i just had this feeling that something wasnt right i had taken marc out of school and decided id take him out to lunch then go back to the radiologists office and try again to see the x ray
4597029 we were sitting in the car after lunch about to head back when my cell phone rings it was the pediatrician and he says youve got to listen to me really closely this was not the result we wanted to see marc has tumors in his neck and his chest down to the nipple level
4597030 so i get hysterical crying in the car this poor child sitting next to me its the day before his 11th birthday and were getting this news i couldnt even comprehend what the doctor was saying i was so upset
4597031 i had always been on the other side of the fence
4597032 helping people understand what the doctor had just told them now i was on the other side and i told myself youve got to get a grip dont be the mother right now be the nurse and figure this thing out
4597033 from that point on i went into take no prisoners mode i was going to do whatever i could for my boy
4597034 if youre going to have a childhood cancer thrown at you hodgkins is the best of the worst because it has a high cure rate
4597035 and i decided thats what we were going to be grateful for
4597036 there was a lot of pain with the chemotherapy a lot of trauma
4597037 michael was devastated when he heard the diagnosis and sometimes he would cry because marc was in such pain but he was a great cheerleader for marc telling him he was a fighter that hed be fine
4597038 after all the kids left i went upstairs and asked mike whats up
4597039 the x ray showed that michael had pneumonia in the lower lobe of his right lung
4597040 so i said okay were on to something now we know what hes got we know what were dealing with
4597041 he says i just got the report and the pneumonia is now in the lower and middle lobes
4597042 so i take michael to winthrop but when i get there they say they want to do a cat scan and this doesnt make any sense to me why do a cat scan for pneumonia after they do the scan they put us in a room in the pediatric icu and this doesnt make any sense to me either i ask a friend of mine who works there whats going on and she tells me not to worry its only because all the other rooms are full
4597043 i see our pediatrician and dr igal fligman a pediatric oncologist who works with dr weinblatt and i wonder what theyre doing there they talk for several minutes then they start walking toward us and my heart sinks
4597044 dr fligman looks at me and he cant talk hes so upset finally he says i dont know how to say this and im thinking this cant be happening im going to have a stroke
4597045 the thought of the ventilator and not being able to talk made him very agitated
4597046 but i told him it would only be for a couple of days until we got his oxygen level back up so he agreed to it
4597047 it was the same time on friday when michael had his parties
4597048 it was almost like his soul decided the time had come to leave his body
4597049 so we went to the hospital and said we want to set up a foundation in michaels name but said we must have complete control of the dollars
4597050 we want 100 percent of the money to go to the kids or the families or the programs run by the child life specialists we dont want it routed through some other fund
4597051 to their enormous credit they said they were fine with everything we asked for
4597052 is to look to the small gifts that can make a child or family member smile for the moment
4597053 people dont realize everything that happens when your child becomes seriously ill
4597054 suddenly youre paying out an extra three or four hundred dollars a month for things like gas parking and fast food and it all comes crashing down on you at the same time a gift card for a tank of gasoline might not seem like much but it can make a tremendous difference
4597055 they have been able to turn something so sad into something very positive for so many other people they are extraordinary people
4597056 the foundation focuses on the ancillary things the quality of life issues for our patients making sure people have food transportation and other necessities making sure that children get gifts on their birthdays and at christmas time little things like that things that people often dont think about can make a world of difference to frightened children and their families
4597057 they have this ability to give to others and to do so with great compassion sometimes when i need a pick me up i see terrie and i just feel better about life i admire so much the way theyve been able to move on and do wonderful things for other people and sadly through personal experience they have great insight into what families go through and what they really need
4597058 last year we counted on people making voluntary contributions to watch the pros play
4597059 this year well be a bit smarter and charge people to watch they can also pay to play with the pros which should be very very cool
4597060 we fought a lot the way brothers do but we were also always looking out for each other i miss him a lot i help out at the foundation as much as i can
4597061 i realized i had two choices i could turn into jello or i could go out there and do something
4597062 there was just no way to save michael his job his mission on this physical earth was done
4597063 it just happened it just came out of the clear blue sky
4597064 and these are the kids who too often arent recognized for how hard they work
4597065 for every good odyssey it is customary to send postcard greetings to friends and family i enjoy collecting vintage disney postcards and sharing the aloha spirit with others in this pin i combined those two interests as mickey mouse sends greetings from the happiest place on earth the disneyland resort hang loose

4597079 en un pa s donde existe seguridad y certeza para el ciudadano y para el desarrollo de sus capacidades es vital y de ah el gobierno mexicano ha ubicado a la seguridad p blica como su m s alta prioridad

4597081 los delincuentes no reconocen fronteras y por ello hay que redoblar los esfuerzos en este combate
4597082 es esencial superar los retos tanto en estados unidos como en m xico para que se avance en esta regi n a fin de propiciar relaciones perdurables entre ambas naciones y de crecer en una alianza para la paz

4597084 estoy muy contento con mucho entusiasmo de poder participar tratar de hacer bien la cosas primero que nada buscar con el club ganar los tres puntos que van a ser ben ficos para el equipo encontrar ese camino que nos de esa seguidilla de triunfos
4597085 aunque no es excusa me costar un poco m s porque no estoy en ritmo en la pretemporada no tuve la oportunidad de participar mucho en el torneo van tres juegos en los que no participo pero me siento bien
4597086 ustedes me preguntaron y nunca dije nada malo estonces soy de los convencidos que esto se tiene que hablar en el campo
4597087 ese es un tema muy aparte nos tiene que dar mucha fuerza mucho esp ritu luchar por nosotros para redoblar esfuerzos para brindarle todo a carlos necesita toda nuestra fuerza y toda nuestra uni n para que siga adelante
4597088 es un rival que tiene muy buenos jugadores tanto para ellos como para nosotros ganar es importante la presi n es para los dos no nos podemos rezagar porque el grupo est muy dif cil no podemos permitirnos por ninguno de los dos lados perder

4597104 robinho es muy buen jugador pero no s lo que ocurrir no es mi trabajo es un trabajo de la directiva de los hombres que manejan el dinero es un fant stico jugador que puede jugar en cualquier club del mundo pero estoy feliz con los jugadores que tengo
4597105 si perdemos contra el portsmouth no ser porque no est robinho ser porque no jugamos bien
4597106 si no ganamos el campeonato no ser porque no haya trabajado duro sino porque alguno ha sido mejor que nosotros respetamos a todos los equipos si no ganamos no significar que soy un mal entrenador
4597107 ellos est n conscientes de que tienen que sacar un buen resultado como local
4597108 la intenci n de nosotros es el ir a sacar los tres puntos regresar a casa con ellos y poder enfrentar a tigres como local pero primero est atlas y hay que tratar de hacer un buen partido durante todos los minutos y manejar los tiempos del encuentro
4597109 est jugando bien se planta bien en el terreno de juego pero desafortunadamente los resultados no se les han dado pero nosotros tenemos que hacer un buen encuentro en todos los sentidos y poder sacar al victoria que es lo que vamos a buscar
4597110 tenemos que seguir sobre la misma l nea no podemos aflojar tenemos que seguir en el plano ascendente no podemos conformarnos ni tampoco confiarnos lo m s importante es mantener esa mentalidad ese deseo de ganar y esperar a salir con los tres puntos del jalisco
4597111 yo creo que la experiencia es muy importante nosotros la tenemos y eso nos ayudar a conseguir buenos resultados sergio debe preocuparse nicamente por su equipo nosotros estamos convencidos de que vamos a hacer un buen partido para pasar por encima del rival
4597112 ser ordenados pero desde el primer minuto salir a ganar todos los balones todas las jugadas salir con una gran actitud con mucha intensidad porque sabemos que tenemos que triunfar y comenzar una buena racha
4597113 s esa es la idea seguir avanzando lugares en el grupo en la tabla creo que el equipo va de menos a m s sabemos del esfuerzo y la actitud que ha mostrado todo el equipo y yo creo que esas son las principales armas para poder ganar el domingo y darle una satisfacci n m s a nuestra gente que ojal nos apoye
4597114 s estos partidos as son nosotros debemos aprovechar cualquier error del rival y al mismo tiempo hacer un partido muy intenso un partido en el que se noten las ganas de salir adelante sin importar como est el rival
4597115 va a ser un partido como todos complicado pero esperamos culminar una semana de trabajo bien ante un equipo que suele ser muy dif cil de enfrentar
4597116 ya pas ahora es una nueva semana nos vamos ha enfrentar a un equipo que va a querer ganar al igual que nosotros y bueno los partidos est n llenos de circunstancias diferentes y ste no va a ser la excepci n
4597117 el equipo viene trabajando bien de una manera en que los equipos en lugar de pensar en otras cosas ya piensan en nosotros y eso es bueno e importante seguir por ese camino
4597118 esto apenas empieza lo que pide el profe ra l arias se ha dado poco a poco y estamos contentos por el paso que se ha dado pero tambi n estamos conscientes que no tenemos nada ganado falta lo m s importante del torneo y hay que cerrar de buena manera

4597126 it used to be conventional wisdom that people under 30 dont care about privacy
4597127 it turned out they definitely care about controlling their own data and in the end that is how beacon really pissed people off
4597128 it seemed like a promising technology at the time positioned to put facebook that much more at the head of the game

4597143 experience is something that every team has to go through and we learned a lot of lessons throughout the year
4597144 last fall was just a starting point for this group to go from and we got better as the year went on we learned the value of hard work during the off season and it paid off with our play in the spring
4597145 our ability to find the net early is going to be crucial in allowing us to control games
4597146 we had a number of players stepping up in the scoring circle throughout the spring and we look for continued improvement in the fall whether its free hits around the circle penalty corners or open play situations we have the personnel and the ability to put the ball in the net
4597147 the midfield is responsible for holding the team together in so many situations they connect the backs and the forward line in our buildup they set the press in defending against our opponents buildup there is a lot of tactical knowledge that has to be applied and by the end of the spring we were happy to have a large group of players able to execute a game plan for 70 minutes
4597148 mental toughness was the biggest area of improvement for our defenders throughout the year
4597149 i was very pleased at the way we defended when we were up late in a game during the spring that composure and confidence will help us
4597150 lindsay and ali are known commodities and with the addition of ally tunitis we have three strong athletes competing for playing time
4597151 were excited with the addition of these eight quality student athletes
4597152 we look forward to them making their mark on the field and in the classroom this is definitely a group that can make a big contribution immediately

4597165 sony computer entertainment is taking another stab at establishing the playstation portable as a film viewing device by lowering title prices signing studio deals to license content and making digital copies playable on the hand held system
4597166 additionally sony wants to release titles that narrowly appeal to young men who make up 92 of psp owners its core demographic is the 15 to 17 year old male teen
4597167 the biggest issue with umd was the lack of creating for a targeted demo
4597168 when we first launched it was a difficult sale i dont think its a big stretch to say that a 16 year old doesnt have a lot of discretionary income we were offering umds that were more expensive than dvds at the time and we want content that is in line with what the demo is asking for action and comedy not romantic dramas

4597172 it was very difficult to find more than one restaurant where you could sit down with a business client
4597173 i remember when this whole town center was just a pile of dirt
4597174 when you first start developing youll go to the big gun chains they have the employers the representation and the rent then you grow the office and residential as the general plan allows
4597175 mimis thrives on the traffic that neighboring retailers provide so the existing target in trolley square and the kohls and wal mart at santee town center were all part of that initial push driving the herd of retailers to follow
4597176 retailers were passing over the smaller santee as an alternative but vestar property management jumped on the opportunity to pull all of the tenants who wanted an east county presence into santee
4597177 specialty stores and luxury goods will probably remain in the regional malls
4597178 hotels more restaurants and sporting goods are other growth areas that this community could support
4597179 i had to go to the mall for victorias secret shoes and electronics

4597185 last season we had a staggered start tevez and anderson joined us and werent 100 percent fit ronaldo got suspended for three games after the first game then rooney got injured in the first match against reading and was out for three games
4597186 by the time we got everyone focused and fit we then went on a fantastic run with our consistency and really good football id prefer to get a good start we want that but we are also able to go the long distance
4597187 in terms of attacking options we are down to the bare bones a bit
4597188 but the backbone is with the midfield players and defenders and there is good variety there hopefully that is enough to get us through the first game against newcastle which is always a good exciting game they will always have a go newcastle
4597189 we need to start well and get off to a flyer and just keep winning
4597190 man united have a few tough games early on we need to focus we have a good home record and if we can continue that and get off to a good start well be all right
4597191 hes probably one of the best ive ever trained with or played against
4597192 he looks awesome he has a great touch opens up defenses and can pass the ball he gets stuck in as well which i like about him he makes it look so easy and is a class act when you see him day in day out you realize how determined he is

4597194 check my voter registration status the web site also has a variety of information regarding voting and voting locations
4597195 the scale on which she makes these numbers available is minuscule compared to the scale on which the government makes them available
4597196 it is my thesis that both transparency and privacy can be balanced through limitations on the access and use of personal information in public records of course we must rethink what information belongs in public records but we must also regulate the uses of our digital biographies government is not doing enough to protect against the uses of the information that it routinely pumps into the public domain
4597197 government agencies and courts must ask themselves what public policy objectives they are accomplishing by making records available on the internet particularly those containing personal information would there be a way to limit the amount of personally identifiable information posted on the net without undermining the public policy purpose of making records accessible on the agencys website

4597242 with this young team its healthy that they tried to score another goal
4597243 im not opposed to that i thought they did well
4597244 all year this team has been great at dealing with pressure
4597245 weve always fought for 90 100 whatever it takes i like the fact that we are creating chances and having different people score goals
4597246 i hoped to to see my team play as well as they have done before this tournament we didnt
4597247 we gave the u s team too much time and space to use their passing skills normally playing the u s brings out the best of us but today we looked a bit tired and didnt have the legs or gas we used to have they created more than we did
4597248 i feel like i am a player i am exhausted and happy even though we started off playing very well before the rain it was hard to get back but the players did a fantastic job in the locker room and in coming back from giving up the goal that made it 1 1 its was a good win
4597249 i had a plan but i changed my mind because the players handled it very well there was music in the locker room and happy smiles they were ready to go this team coached themselves in the locker room when it was raining outside i am very proud of that
4597250 i thought we did well at forward with a rod because of her speed and with angela hucles we switched carli lloyd to a more attacking role in hopes that she would get some more shots with all due respect for canada which is a good team we were thinking about extra time and that 30 minutes we got 30 minutes out of tash so i thought that was good timing
4597251 i think we did a little bit of both and with this young team i think its healthy that they tried to score another goal i am not opposed to that i thought they did well
4597252 im really proud of the team for the way we handled the rain delay canada is a great squad and weve played them many times this year we respect them a lot and have to come out every game and play tough and battle but also possess the ball we did a great job with our possession and created a lot of chances
4597253 natasha brings so much energy and when she comes on the field she brings an excitement and energy to our team her physical battle in the air is amazing and there she was finishing on a header
4597254 i see how she is when she comes onto the field when shes waving to the crowd and getting the crowd going that puts a smile on the faces of the people on the field who are already tired and it lifts us up
4597255 amy rodriguez got it in the corner and just laid it back and i was wide open i knew natasha was in there so if i could get that cross in behind the back four she could head it in
4597256 all year this team has been great at dealing with pressure of being down a goal or tied or having a team come back weve always fought for 90 100 whatever it takes minutes i like the fact that we are creating the chances and having different people score goals the next step is having people finish them
4597257 it was one of those strange games because i didnt have to do too much especially in the first half but suddenly sinclair gets her great touch her one shot and thats usually how canada plays us not a lot to do but when i have to do something its usually you have to make a great save but that said it was a hard game our defense was all over the place going into tackles and going up for air balls it was intense
4597258 i told tash that we were going to need her big time in this tournament i told her she would have to come on the field and that we would need goals from her she came on and played awesome
4597259 the field was beautifiul it drained probably the best of any field ive ever played on the rain was not a factor what so ever
4597260 it was a very difficult game anytime you get in a quarterfinal its a gamble who is going to win there are lucky bounces and sometimes the best team doesnt win canada was a heck of a team tonight and we had many chances and didnt finish them and it kept them in the game
4597261 it was a long time but thats what the olympics are about its never going to be easy
4597262 there were so many players who stepped in the final 30 minutes and played really hard were getting some momentum we lost our first game but weve played well ever since hopefully that momentum will carry on through to the semifinals
4597263 the ball got played back to shannon boxx and i saw her ready to cross so i just made sure i got on the end of it
4597264 it doesnt matter if i play 90 minutes or a minute as long as i help the team it takes all 18 players to be successful i came in knowing i need to be that spark and help my teammates out and we came out with the win
4597265 four is for cat whitehill 20 for abby wambach and 12 for leslie osborne they got injured this year and they are a big part of our team i just wanted to give them a shout so i got their numbers on my headband
4597266 the way we looked at it was that we were starting the game all over again 0 0 it might have played into canadas favor a little bit because we got that early goal we were playing great soccer and they were definitely on their heels and then we had to come inside for such a long time
4597267 soccer is crazy sometimes and this definitely is a new experience for us i dont think weve ever been at a game for this long but if we can do this we can do anything right
4597268 shes just full of energy shes great starting a game but maybe even better coming off the bench she really gave us the lift that we needed and that goal was unbelievable
4597269 the cool thing about this olympics so far is that weve had so many different goal scorers i think that is whats making us special right now weve had six different goal scorers for seven goals so thats a pretty cool stat and thats whats making us so unpredictable
4597270 we have to give a lot of credit to our defenders who played 120 tough minutes against a canadian team that is constantly trying to get behind our back line the amount of 50 yard sprints our backs made was amazing everybody did their part tonight
4597271 youre going to keep getting your chances and statistics tell you that that more chances you get your more likely to get one in so you really cant think those negative thoughts thats not going to do you any good when youre out on the field so i think that collectively we were very confident
4597272 games like this are why you play my legs were dead everyones legs were tired but you just have to push through it its deal with this or go home so we stayed behind each other and told each other to keep going and ended up with a victory
4597273 i feel like i am a player i am exhausted and happy even though we started off playing very well before the rain it was hard to get back but the players did a fantastic job in the locker room and in coming back from giving up the goal that made it 1 1 its was a good win

4597387 on the campaign trail john mccain claims that he fought to expose jack abramoff and his corrupt cronies
4597388 it was a scandal that rocked the country linking all the way to the bush white house and republicans in congress sending two former republican congressmen to prison
4597389 but now desperate to raise campaign cash to run more negative attack ads john mccain is cozying up to jack abramoffs cronies

4597398 to see if they could try and resolve the issue with the people who were asking questions
4597399 they responded and apparently it isnt good enough that he posted his birth certificate
4597400 they say they want it because they claim he is not a citizen of the united states its pretty ridiculous
4597401 there is not one shred of evidence to disprove politifacts conclusion that the candidates name is barack hussein obama or to support allegations that the birth certificate he released isnt authentic and thats true no matter how many people cling to some hint of doubt and use the internet to fuel their innate sense of distrust

4597546 refused to communicate with the administration and refused to be a team player
4597547 things just didnt work out thats all i can tell you
4597548 were all happy we were able to figure this out within the first four months instead of dragging it out over four years
4597549 now its all over and we can all move on i sincerely wish daniel nothing but the best in life and i hope he feels the same toward the district
4597550 i love this community and my family does too so we hope to stay in the community for a long time
4597551 my two children start school in indian prairie unit district 204 in just over a week and were excited about that
4597552 this is a situation where daniel and the board realized that they did not see eye to eye on the basic direction of the park district and how it should be managed there is no one event that caused this realization but rather a series of things over the past few months
4597553 betts recognized that the board had the right to an executive director with whom it saw eye to eye the board recognized the fact that daniel had relocated his wife and two young children to naperville from denver and that once he left the park district finding another comparable job would likely be difficult
4597554 that woman is incredible but its not fair to her
4597555 id really like to see someone come in and give that woman a break if we had two mindys that would be great
4597556 as much as naperville likes to make fun of the park district we are still one of the most outstanding districts out there

4597563 well i dont know a lot about john mccains family history i do know however that as recently as last week i think it was the senator made a comment in south dakota regarding his wife entering some buffalo chips contest which is this topless deal and if she were to enter she would probably win it and my personal opinion and based on my understanding of the christian faith thats not not n o t not the type of expression that a presidential candidate or anyone for that matter who is a follower of the christian faith ought to make
4597564 i dont know if that is a perfect case in point but it surely does help to juxtapose the dna of senator obama if you would versus the dna of senator mccain

4597587 a lot of things have happened in this century and most of them plug into walls
4597588 a change in an environment is rarely only additive or linear what you have is a totally new environment requiring a whole new repertoire of survival strategies
4597589 when you plug something into a wall someone is getting plugged into you which means you need new patterns of defense perception understanding evaluation you need a new kind of education
4597590 as the number of messages increases the amount of information carried decreases we have more media to communicate fewer significant ideas
4597591 change isnt new whats new is the degree of change change changed
4597592 change occurs so rapidly that each of us in the course of our lives has continuously to work out a set of values beliefs and patterns of behavior that are viable or seem viable to each of us personally and just when we have identified a workable system it turns out to be irrelevant because so much has changed while we were doing it
4597593 the trouble is that most teachers have the idea that they are in some other sort of business some believe for example that they are in the information dissemination business
4597594 while students have to live with tv film the lp record communication satellites and the laser beam their teachers are still talking as if the only medium on the scene is gutenbergs printing press
4597595 while students have to understand psychology and psychedelics anthropology and anthropomorphism birth control and biochemistry their teachers are teaching subjects that mostly dont exist anymore
4597596 while students need to find new roles for themselves as social political and religious organisms their teachers are acting almost entirely as shills for corporate interests shaping them up to be functionaries in one bureaucracy or another
4597597 future shock occurs when you are confronted by the fact that the world you were educated to believe in doesnt exist
4597598 we just may not survive another generation of inadvertent entropy helpers
4597599 of course we are glad to be here today to go up to the finance department office to ask will you please provide this information for us
4597600 im chairmen of county council anderson county and im requesting that you provide me to look at the backup of these credit cards
4597601 when would it be when we would ever be able to get those humphries
4597602 i will check with my county administrator who is my boss and we certainly let you know
4597603 you will let us know when will you let us know
4597604 i was surprised because i see no real foundation for it
4597605 i dont recall any sort of demeanor like that i just remember we were asking to look at those credit card files
4597606 no private business would allow someone who is not the employer to give its employees orders or instructions
4597607 state law makes the administrator the employer not the individual county council members they are interfering with my ability to do my job and creating havoc in the workplace

4597648 id really like to see someone come in and give that woman a break if we had two mindys that would be great

4597686 ive done a lot to promote and change the way messages are relayed to our children and our families over the last few years promoting positive content and positive messages is so important to educate and preserve the next generation being exposed to positive content is what changed my life i believe that there is a market in our community for a new diverse network that provides a new brand of superior programming that caters to all aspects of television from reality to original programming in addition im excited to be able to expose the urban community to a vast array of jobs in the entertainment community that they might not otherwise be privy to i have a great relationship with bet and mtv and my son and i will continue to do work with them and support their networks with bbtv were spearheading the initiative to meet consumer demand for family friendly hip hop content

4597712 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4597790 theyre at a different club now and its a new challenge for them obviously its very important that theyre good players and you have to remember they are good players
4597791 i think for me to shy away from different characters and people who maybe had a bit of baggage or a bit of history i dont think its a good reflection on me ive got to try and deal with that
4597792 im not one for going round threatening people and warning them i was probably hard work myself when i was a player
4597793 if they step out of line ill be ready to pounce but so far in the last three weeks theyve been good as gold but theres a long way to go yet
4597794 thats the challenge we all face thats the big question mark
4597795 this time last year the word on everybodys lips was survival and we managed to do that but the next challenge is to go higher than 15th
4597796 i said many times last year theres three leagues the big four then theres the villas tottenhams blackburns and manchester citys and then theres eight or nine teams near the bottom we basically want to finish top of that league and i think that would be progress for the football club
4597797 i think our results against the liverpools wont make or break our season it would be nice to get off to a decent start and to show we made some sort of progress
4597798 this time last year we were facing tottenham whod invested heavily and were talking about finishing in the top four but we beat them
4597799 well be ready for liverpool on saturday no doubt about that

4597826 so i always pay attention when im out on the road recruiting to see if theres a guy that could be a potential fit for us in the future
4597827 if you look at the history of roger penske and roger didnt have the ultimate stats that tony stewart does but roger was a racer
4597828 it is extremely important to me to have somebody that understands the driving part of it the ownership part of it the teammate part of it the personnel part of it which is extremely important nowadays that meant a lot
4597829 so yeah roger i still have a lot of respect for him and look forward to the rest of the season fulfilling my obligations but i definitely see the true racer and the potential future businessman in tony stewart
4597830 were working to not get just one crew chief were working to get a pair of crew chiefs that like ryan said are going to work well together
4597831 it helps us work together better as drivers and keeps the organization just that much more intact ive seen multi car organizations that the crew chiefs were in different directions with each other and they dont utilize the opportunity of what a two car team is all about in the right way
4597832 were going to rely on ryans input as much as anybodys you know to make this decision
4597833 i dont think theres a lot of teams and organizations that have had a scenario where they get to go out at the same time and go after two crew chiefs so you know maybe this is something that will even be that much better for us
4597834 to have tony come on board and now ryan its just unbelievable
4597835 were thrilled tonys led the charge the program is growing its exciting to be part of it to have ryan be a part of it what can we say the rocketman is on board
4597836 we were hoping to have them done for today but we didnt get it done in time so hopefully in the next couple weeks well have something locked down on that side
4597837 but its just making sure that we put the right partners together when youre working with multiple sponsors its making sure that you have the continuity between the two to make sure it works for both parties it makes it a little harder and the process is a little harder to get the contract it is done

4597846 the problem is the ossetians and the abkhaz believe only russian peacekeepers and nobody else the past 15 years have shown more than once that the sole forces capable of protecting interests and quite often lives are russian troops
4597847 finnish foreign minister alexander stubb who is chairman in office of the osce has told us that the monitors could come to georgia in a matter of days
4597848 we are of course not against international peacekeepers but the problem is that the abkhazians and the ossetians do not trust anyone except for russian peacekeepers

4597882 ewwww i see teachers butt crack an its naaaa aasty
4597883 well maybe its because those sizes arent available in the stores if it was widely known that the gap had these sizes stocked you can be sure larger people would be shopping there also im sorry you now carry a size double 0 how many grown ass women do you know who wear a double 0 and arent currently hospitalized i certainly know a lot more people who wear a size 16 than i know who wear a size 00 and i dont think im in the minority
4597884 well we simply dont have the room to stock those sizes on our shelves
4597885 well if you cut down on other sizes that you always seem to have lots of left say the 00 then you would have more room in store for the fattie fat jeans

4597908 it used to be conventional wisdom that people under 30 dont care about privacy
4597909 it turned out they definitely care about controlling their own data and in the end that is how beacon really pissed people off
4597910 it seemed like a promising technology at the time positioned to put facebook that much more at the head of the game
4597911 these sites have become much more sensitive to giving users control of their own information
4597912 we are just at the formative stage in the use of social networking as a promotional vehicles people will be more cautious but that wont stop the innovation
4597913 social networks now know they cant take peoples private information and make it public without asking for permission first
4597914 a lot of the startups think that using consumer data is a magic bullet for cash flow problems if the law and lawmakers begin to take online privacy violations more seriously these companies will have to rethink their strategies as they move forward

4597921 our kids start by learning to care for the small animals and then the adult goats then to care for pregnant goats deliver the goat kids then to raise those kids
4597922 learn they did they raised two kidding seasons kids and this past june took the two adult does and this years five goat kids to the american goat society national dairy goat show
4597923 these animals are registered to the committee therefore all owners and associates of the association have legal rights and ownership of these animals this is proven by the fact these children could show them and legally sign for their national titles won at show
4597924 all we can tell you at the moment is that we are reviewing the situation there along with napa county code enforcement and the napa county public health department
4597925 im now confused as to how it is illegal for the owners of these animals to not be allowed to consume the milk or cheese from these same animals where will the regulation stop will it be illegal to own your own cow chicken or goat in the next decade shall we all be dammed to consume only chemically altered or radiated foods in the next generation how can you expect to have sustainable agriculture if the small farms ranches and dairies are asked to comply with regulations that make it impossible to maintain a viable income or lifestyle

4597933 on the question of the pre election media environment the cambodian national election commission questioned the eu election observation missions view that there was unfair and unequal access to media in favour of the ruling party the opposition parties were able to freely convey their ideology and criticism of the government to listeners through voice of america radio and radio free asia
4597934 a man who answered the phone of prime minister hun sens nephew hun chea and identified himself as hun cheas younger brother admitted tuesday to his familys involvement in a hit and run killing and blamed the victim for being inebriated its not right what radio free asia broadcasted saying that it was unintentional murder it was not it was a normal traffic accident in which the motorbike driver was very drunk he said
4597935 as useful as the recent uproar over censorship in beijing was for calling attention to the broader issue the failure of outsiders to understand how censorship affects the chinese internet in practice is a source of frustration inside the country earlier this week i heard from a blogger du dongjin after he received an email from the voice of america celebrating the unblocking of their chinese website in my point of view he complained it is quite a plain comment that voa does not care if there is internet censorship in china it only cares its own interests by this he meant that whatever the incremental benefits unblocking voas site or any other one or several foreign sites wont change the more problematic aspects of beijings web control

4597992 i was hoping to not have to do anything to defend that jersey but i ended up having to go for that first sprint i got over the first climb 5 or 6 guys or a little bit more than that i thought wed keep it rolling to the first sprint no one was there to contend i thought theyd give it to me people starting coming back on and coming on then a lot of it came back together it was a little tough but i was happy to take the sprint and then i just kept rolling for the climb figured i could ride the climb at my own tempo and just get caught half way up that would be better than following all the accelerations up the climb it worked out really well for me the second climb was kind of a non factor for me which was really good
4597993 it was just a moment of not paying attention i rubbed wheel with brent i threw a bottle and i looked over and oh soot im going to get a fine for that and then i rubbed i was going left brent was going right and we just rubbed wheels we were moving pretty good i went down and it was pretty painful and i got up and then tried to put it back together and my collarbone moved out of place thats it my helmet took a hit it did its job pain
4597994 ian was in the break with me he was doing a great job of maintaining the pace the other guys in the break didnt seem to want to come through and it was pretty much him and the guy in the kom jersey the two of them and myself i was riding through to relieve them sometimes but i really trying to save for the climbs and it was really unfortunate that ian punctured with 5 k to go to big mountain but i was feeling good and at the stage i decided i had to commit and i was just praying for good legs i felt that i had good legs it would have been nice to have been able to ride blake off but i think he benefited from being able to sit on and he had fresher legs going into the climb i guess he did a good job to stay there
4597995 i just was at the front so i got second on the first one i went oh well and then the next one it was a big chainring sort of finish a few guys were before me but i just caught them and went around them then the last one i rode tempo all the way up on my own no one came over at the top i had all the guys behind me i dont like when guys sort of surge or attack but i can always stay with them but i prefer to ride at the front set a hard enough tempo hat guys dont attack no one sort of contested over the top

4598050 el costo es un gran problema en general las defensor as p blicas en am rica latina no tenemos mucho apoyo de los gobiernos no hay recursos en brasil por ejemplo solamente en los ltimos a os hemos venido recibiendo m s atenci n de parte del gobierno en este momento el mayor obst culo es se
4598051 no s cu nto puede costar presentar un caso ante la corte hay traslados hospedajes tr mites y hay casos que demoran un tiempo adem s para las pruebas se necesita contratar peritos tanto de la parte actora como del estado en un caso sobre supuesta violaci n a la libertad de prensa en panam por ejemplo se contrataron dos peritos
4598052 en nuestro caso particular hasta ahora no se ha tenido una experiencia ante la corte porque llegar a esa instancia implica muchos recursos econ micos y generalmente nuestros patrocinados carecen de ellos y dependemos de organismos que puedan ayudar
4598053 la principal dificultad es el conocimiento nosotros hemos sido formados para litigar m s bien a nivel interno y carecemos de entrenamiento para acceder a los organismos internacionales
4598054 el estado no es nuestro enemigo esta audiencia m s all de las connotaciones jur dicas debe tener un car cter pedag gico en el sentido de que el fallo permita contribuir al fortalecimiento de la democracia boliviana
4598055 democracia no es s lo elegir autoridades mediante el voto es tambi n vivir en el contexto del respeto a los derechos humanos y que todo lo que quede pendiente venga de la dictadura o no no se quede en la impunidad queremos sentar un precedente para que nunca m s en bolivia un gobierno sea civil o militar detenga ilegalmente torture y haga desaparecer gente se trata de ir creando una cultura de derechos humanos
4598056 la corte ejerce una influencia muy importante en materia de derechos humanos ha liderado un proceso que ha llevado paulatinamente a que la gente ubique la importancia del tribunal
4598057 es netamente positiva por las recomendaciones que realiza y porque los estados contratantes aceptan esas recomendaciones y las cumplen
4598058 a pesar de no tener una estructura suficiente para dar cabida a todos los procesos el tribunal ha tenido resultados importantes
4598059 se cre una nueva ley que da m s protecci n a las mujeres v ctimas de violencia en el hogar ahora los delitos cometidos contra las mujeres son considerados mucho m s graves que antes

4598076 when an employee dies in harness his family is thrown into penury and sudden distress on account of stoppage of income but where a person is permanently incapacitated due to serious illness or accident and his services are consequently terminated the family is thrown into greater financial hardship because not only the income stops but at the same time there is a considerable additional expenditure by way of medical treatment as also the need for an attendant to constantly look after him
4598077 consequences in case of an employee being medically invalidated on account of a serious illness accident will be no less in fact far more than the consequences of death in harness
4598078 when compassionate appointment of a dependent of a government servant who dies in harness is accepted to be an exception to the general rule there is no reason or justification to hold that an offer of compassionate appointment to the dependent of a government servant who is medically invalidated is not an exception to the general rule
4598079 any adverse perception about safety and security of tourists will have serious implications for tourist arrivals in the country taking this into consideration the ministry has asked the states to form tourism security organisations to ensure the safety of tourists in their respective jurisdictions at the earliest
4598080 this scandal shows that lalu and his kin have an immense greed for wealth and to satisfy that they have not even spared the people of their caste

4598089 it would have cost me personally over 50 000 to hire an expert actuary now living in australia to work out the catch registers and logs remember the winebox case cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars for which i was never compensated
4598090 the ministry of fisheries has been at the centre of these problems since the quota management system qms was established by the then labour deputy prime minister geoffrey palmer
4598091 there have been four ministers since then ken shirley doug kidd john luxton and pete hodgson all have failed to understand the level of sheer incompetence at the mof and worse
4598092 i have raised the issue with the current minister publicly and privately an in house inquiry by a barrister and an investigation by the serious fraud office failed to get anywhere moreover neither office contacted me
4598093 as i said when i raised this issue in parliament if some companies have taken advantage of a situation that the ministry created it is for the ministry to correct the situation and to compensate any aggrieved parties that is at the core of the issue
4598094 within weeks of receiving information from mr penwarden i learned that he had also approached the national party and his information ended up in the hands of former minister doug kidd
4598095 assignment came to interview me about immigration and then briefly raised with me the scampi issue but failed to ask any substantive questions or ask for any information i might have held
4598096 having seen the assignment programme today i regard their investigation as shoddy and hopelessly inadequate
4598097 mr penwarden has no idea of the breadth of information that i hold and i have spoken with every major fishing company in this country scores of personalities in the industry and every one has received my assurance that the ministry was my target
4598098 i find it very ironic that nobody wanted to know about the corruption allegations when i first raised them but are now in a feeding frenzy
4598099 it is a bit rich after the election to find now that new zealand first is some sort of media target when first we have never had any control over the ministry of fisheries or the fishing industry and second only one newspaper the independent has hitherto been interested in my comments on this issue
4598100 the rest have done their usual rip van winkle impersonation and i am sick of doing their job for them
4598101 my investigations ran into complications we welcome the inquiry that i asked for months ago but it has to be across the industry the ministry and the four fisheries ministers concerned geoffrey palmer should also front up
4598102 obama is not a marxist or a radical yet it is clear that radicals have influenced his judgment
4598103 these books are cut from the same cloth made up of the same old debunked smears that have been floating around the internet for months
4598104 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4598105 the case against barack obama the unlikely rise and unexamined agenda of the medias favorite candidate
4598106 obama wants to will all the white blood out of himself so he can become pure black
4598107 dividing people in the name of religion can complicate these issues further which can also pose a threat to the unity and integrity of the country i appeal to the people of jammu and kashmir to cooperate with us in establishing peace in the state
4598108 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take
4598109 we will examine the functioning of our intelligence agencies and police and security forces and take all possible steps to equip them to tackle this challenge whatever resources are required will be provided
4598110 it will open up new opportunities for trade in dual use high technologies and nuclear materials and equipment opening up new pathways to accelerate industrialisation of our country it will enable us to provide electricity to meet the needs of our farmers our artisans our traders and our industry

4598124 the allegations that have surfaced in turkey are a political matter and have nothing to do with our purchase of the land or subsequent store development
4598125 when big foreign companies come to turkey we expect them to work to the principles of the laws in their own country too any business activity that involves politicians using their political influence is very worrying to us
4598126 doing business internationally can be challenging for any business but we have a strong set of values which ensure that wherever we operate we act responsibly treat people fairly and abide by local laws and regulations
4598127 near term there is more impact from turkey which has got a lot of momentum with 35 hypermarkets opened this year

4598137 geopolitical concerns and the realization that global slowdown concerns are behind the slump in commodities are acting as an offset of sorts that is restraining buying interest at this juncture
4598138 the softening economic situation has led to a further slowdown in oil demand growth
4598139 falling commodity prices and a stronger dollar have supported the market but the mood on a summer friday is cautious
4598140 as for the markets equity investors who are actually looking into the future should be buoyed by this report and with oil continuing to collapse the stars are starting to align at least for next year
4598141 there are some hedge funds that are just great and if you get into the right one at the right time you can make a killing
4598142 the original hedge fund was designed to take risk out of investing
4598143 we like to say that we manage the risk first then optimize the return second
4598144 the assumption the sec makes is that if you have more net worth you have more sophistication
4598145 its in the best interest of the hedge fund manager and the client to understand each other
4598146 not everyone has the ability to understand which hedge fund managers are right for them
4598147 were more patient and more disciplined about having an eye for the long term

4598160 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring
4598161 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry
4598162 inconsistencies and inadequacies which limit the interpretations of the findings

4598212 however since 1989 the loss of fertilizer subsidies from the former soviet union reduced nutrient loading by a factor of two to four with the result that by 1995 the hypoxic zone had gone

4598239 creating a legitimate index of economic freedom requires three radical departures from what the heritage foundation has been offering first economic systems are not binary markets are not determined by a simple choice between increased freedom of exchange and increased command by government throughout the world there currently are three distinctive types of market nation states in the current world economy do not fall on a continuum between free and command markets but generally have mixtures of all three a legitimate index needs to account for how all three components relate to economic freedom second the importance of economic freedom applies ultimately to individuals real individuals instead of corporations or even proprietorships unconstrained corporations do not promote liberty if government and corporations effectively collaborate to constrain the economic choices of laborers per capita gdp does not reflect economic freedom if the wealth is concentrated among the few a legitimate index needs to provide some reflection on the liberty or economic freedom of a real individual assuming that the middle class would choose compensation to be diffused according to earned merit rather than concentrated according to greed wealth distribution reflects on economic freedom more than any current indicator in the index third citizens should not have to be economic scholars to fathom the meaning of information being provided for general consumption there are three simple measurements that together characterize market exchange the proportion that proprietorships contribute to gross domestic product indicates free market activity the proportion that governments contribute indicates command markets and the proportion that business corporations contribute indicates laissez faire markets in addition a variety of simple measurements can determine the impact of economic freedom on individuals contrasting mean and median incomes or the proportion of wealth controlled by different classes provide reliable indicators of wealth distribution

4598377 were in a world where instead of just trying to contain a guy whos really big youre trying to contain a guy who can in the case of icicle who can freeze things what kind of a cell would a guy like that need in order to have his powers neutralized so to escape from super max they have got to go through the most elaborate heist weve ever seen involving superpowers because the prison itself kind of has superpowers
4598378 what we wanted to do and i think well continue to do as the studio continues to push the movie forward is to be able to put queen in the center of a much bigger universe
4598379 in the same way that marvel is starting to do when youre in the filmed dc universe where this world and this world and this world they all exist in an interrelated web its the kind of thing that i think absolutely is about spelling out a couple different roads for a couple different characters
4598380 by the time a movie like this comes out we will all understand origin stories and mainstream audiences now are willing to suspend their disbelief to the point that we can believe that a world exists where superpowers exist and people dress up in costumes so now what now what do we do and i call this superhero 2 0
4598381 we do deal with his origin hes got a very interesting origin with a desert island and everything else but we get to the core of green arrow not by showing where he starts but by pushing him into a key moment in his life where everything he has is lost and hes got to earn it all back i think for audiences its going to be a great way to get to know a new character
4598382 i see him as the jason bourne of superheroes a guy who exists with his own sort of set of tricks and i think the difference between ollie queen and a guy like bruce wayne theyre both rich they both have their things but batman is about his equipment and is about his theatricality and about his detective skills and green arrow is a guy whos really just the sort of macgyver type
4598383 you know i am very ashamed we dont have any money left and i am so hungry

4598397 with so much media in ireland now coming from overseas or originating over the internet co regulation by government and industry represents the best way to regulate alcohol advertising in ireland as it can embrace advertising on media and channels which are outside the jurisdiction of the state
4598398 co regulation also recognises that in a fast moving media and marketing environment legislation is not flexible enough to respond to changing requirements the rise of social media for example is a recent phenomenon which can make legislation irrelevant yet agreed codes can respond to it quickly

4598400 i have just been reading your article in the national mirror and thought i should put you in the know because you seemed misguided and accused your brother beenwell mwale for nothing some members of mecoz assisted by our learned lawyers present argued that if mecoz was to gain the credibility it deserves in ensuring press freedom ethical conduct of media practitioners etc it needed to have some enforceable powers in its current state where its constitution says it should be non statutory voluntary and self regulatory it would be difficult for it to enforce the codes on the journalists and media organisations and institutions because any media personnel or institution found wanting would choose not to abide by mecoz adjudication and may even decide to withdraw thereby condoning unethical behaviour especially from such people who claim to be journalists and yet they are not but tread on personal agenda mr ndhlovu do not tell me you do not know about such people who have tarnished the image of our profession during that debate members of the meeting resolved that to give mecoz the teeth to ensure the media self regulate themselves it needed to be given legal powers to adjudicate cases brought to it by the general public and thereby reduce the time and cases of legal redress through courts of law it was resolved that mecoz should be legislated like the law association of zambia the zambia institute of certified accounts the engineering regulation board so that the government would have no excuse of imposing itself on the media this does not mean government would be involved in the running of mecoz but this would entirely be the media baby
4598401 i still want to disagree with mr ng onga a former workmate at the zambia daily mail the best media regulator is the market and not some state regulated busy bodies who want to even prescribe what words to use when writing stories discerning readers would not want to associate themselves with nondescript rags of newspapers which do not adhere to media ethics for starters how many newspapers have folded up on the zambian market because of their poor news presentation plenty we have had newspapers of all hues and shades literally but because they did not respect other people in the way they reported and readers and advertisers simply stopped giving them business

4598483 hes obviously a very good finisher but i think to be classed as great forward i think youre movement has got to be up there i think his is first class
4598484 you look at robbie keanes record over the last few years at tottenham and his has been great as well
4598485 he not only scored goals but hes created them as well hes obviously a player who can create goals out of nothing really
4598486 the fact is that fernando is quick his movements very good and hopefully robbie keane can supply him on paper it looks a fantastic partnership so i hope it definitely works
4598487 im speaking purely from a fans point of view here

4598495 theyre at a different club now and its a new challenge for them obviously its very important that theyre good players and you have to remember they are good players
4598496 i think for me to shy away from different characters and people who maybe had a bit of baggage or a bit of history i dont think its a good reflection on me ive got to try and deal with that
4598497 im not one for going round threatening people and warning them i was probably hard work myself when i was a player
4598498 if they step out of line ill be ready to pounce but so far in the last three weeks theyve been good as gold but theres a long way to go yet
4598499 thats the challenge we all face thats the big question mark
4598500 this time last year the word on everybodys lips was survival and we managed to do that but the next challenge is to go higher than 15th
4598501 i said many times last year theres three leagues the big four then theres the villas tottenhams blackburns and manchester citys and then theres eight or nine teams near the bottom we basically want to finish top of that league and i think that would be progress for the football club
4598502 i think our results against the liverpools wont make or break our season it would be nice to get off to a decent start and to show we made some sort of progress
4598503 this time last year we were facing tottenham whod invested heavily and were talking about finishing in the top four but we beat them

4598509 you know those stories when people die from something unexpected and you automatically say

4598514 i know what other people will say i know they will tell me that time will eventually heal the pain they will tell me everythings going to be okay they will tell me all those things that human beings who mean well say in situations like this i know all that

4598551 councils are increasingly having to consider taking action where parents are putting childrens health in real danger
4598552 as the obesity epidemic grows these tricky cases will keep on cropping up councils would step in to deal with an undernourished and neglected child so should a case with a morbidly obese child be different if parents consistently place their children at risk through bad diet and lack of exercise is it right that a council should step in to keep the childs health under review
4598553 the nations expanding waistline threatens to have a devastating impact on our public services its a huge issue for public health but it also risks placing an unprecedented amount of pressure on council services
4598554 but in the worst cases the children would need to be put on at risk registers or taken into care
4598555 even then the care proceedings may well have been instigated because of related problems rather than exclusively because of their weight
4598556 can have very serious consequences for a childs health and the parental behaviour that leads to childhood obesity can be a form of neglect
4598557 children who are dangerously overweight should be brought into hospital where they can be given 24 hour care for several weeks or months but their parents should have access to them
4598558 it would be better to help the parents provide better nutrition for their child rather than break up the family

4598572 when you move clubs the important thing is to move forward you look to where you are moving to and in this case it is a big club like rangers so it wasnt difficult for me to move to rangers my first impressions are very good ive seen the training ground and i went to the stadium yesterday morning i can just imagine what a fantastic atmosphere it must be when it is full of fans
4598573 its a disappointment not being involved in european competition but that doesnt mean the team wont improve
4598574 it is maybe even a motivation as the players and the fans will miss european football so much this year that we really want to achieve it next year of course i would love to be involved in uefa competitions and thats a reason to move forward and try to be champions this year
4598575 im 29 now and at a good stage of a players career its a perfect time to enjoy your football especially at a big club and winning the most important thing is in the summer when you go on holiday and you look back and can say well i have won the league or i have won the cup i have no regrets about anything i have done in my career in the past so im very happy with my move to rangers

4598627 basically musharraf is being stubborn the two sides are playing brinkmanship
4598628 all institutions will be seriously damaged by impeachment perhaps beyond repair
4598629 he musharraf may think it is better to go down as president and hope the army bails him out

4598656 and i also feel that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4598657 that does not mean we exclude people from our party who are pro choice
4598658 pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
4598659 i think mccain has to have a running mate that clearly connects with social conservatives in the party
4598660 that is where he is lacking so if he picks a pro choice running mate i dont see how he can win this race
4598661 stay home but there is a core of voters whose level of enthusiasm influences people further from the core so if mccain picks a pro choice running mate the strength of turnout on election day is not going to be there for him
4598662 add up to one thing the public thinks mccain just might be a moderate on abortion
4598663 recognize d differing views on this question among americans in general and in our own p arty
4598664 in truth it was his 2000 position on abortion that was the outlier a short lived attempt to court the center
4598665 seem to be enough to convince the electorate that mccains votes honestly represent his beliefs
4598666 question is whether pro choice voters are going to take a chance on mccain
4598667 we still by and large believe its white we believe its male we believe its gay we believe its other we believe its you know women who are promiscuous and we think its not me

4598807 we have seen first hand how asbestos has wreaked havoc on americans working in naval shipyards automobile plants and the construction industry most often this is through their employers conscious choice for profits over a workers health

4598812 the working hypothesis is that if psilocybin or lsd can occasion these experiences of great personal meaning and spiritual significance then it would allow patients with terminal illnesses hopefully to face their own demise completely differently to restructure some of the psychological angst that so often occurs concurrently with severe disease

4598815 loan losses are likely to be higher for all banks than estimated earlier and that includes wells fargo
4598816 the opportunities to expand the customer base in bad times should meaningfully enhance the banks secular opportunities in good times
4598817 wells fargo continues to be the only bank in the u s to be rated aaa continues to grow has a strong balance sheet and has the strongest capital ratios in our peer group
4598818 given the companys diversification wells fargo continues to perform well during the current economic cycle just as it has endured through all kinds of economic cycles during our 156 year history
4598819 it dramatically overpaid for bear stearns to help the financial markets wells does not make a mistake like this
4598820 most banks that have cdos have written off amounts that are many multiple times the size of the wells fargo total portfolio
4598821 in good times customer memories will focus on the fact that when times were tough wells fargo was the bank to go to

4598833 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
4598834 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter

4598841 no one really knew how to make a record when i started
4598842 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play
4598843 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4598844 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4598845 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4598846 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4598847 among my favorite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite
4598848 higher taxes on your paycheck your life savings your electric bills

4598850 although men are heavy users of the web they tend not to visit sites explicitly aimed at them
4598851 in the absence of action at the federal level local and state governments may begin to explore their options for oversight of nanotechnologies
4598852 today there are more than 600 manufacturer identified consumer products available on the market that contain nanomaterials and countless other commercial and industrial applications the public and policymakers are not aware of
4598853 unfortunately federal agencies currently have to draw on decades old laws to ensure the safe development and use of these technologically advanced products many of which are woefully out of date federal officials need 21st century tools for cutting edge technologies anything short of that is unacceptable
4598854 ive always been a big fan of putting into the market on a regular basis regardless of what is happening in the overall market
4598855 if ive learned anything in the more than a quarter of a century of following the markets it is this fact buying stocks when you know you should i e during sharp down moves is really difficult our heads says we should after all substantial market downturns create the best values
4598856 but our emotions usually take control thus making it very difficult to pull the trigger and put money into the market when stocks are falling
4598857 thats why ive always been a big fan of 401 k plans with these investment vehicles investment programs are put on autopilot with dollars being put into the market on a regular basis usually each paycheck regardless of what is happening in the overall market
4598858 fortunately investors can duplicate the autopilot feature of 401 k plans with their drip investments by taking advantage of automatic monthly investment features provided by most drips
4598859 under this feature investors can set up automatic investments via electronic debit of their bank accounts each month for investors who use this feature drip plans usually reward them with a number of benefits
4598860 for example it is not unusual for a firm to waive the minimum initial investment amount if an investor is willing to agree to automatic monthly investments via electronic debit from their bank account
4598861 however disney will waive this amount if an investor agrees to automatic monthly investment of at least 100 the ability to invest smaller amounts via electronic debit increases the accessibility of many drip plans
4598862 firms usually charge a lower fee on shares purchased with automatic monthly investment returning to our disney example the firm charges drip participants a fee of 5 for shares purchased with a check however shares purchased via automatic monthly investment are charged a fee of just 1
4598863 true if you choose to invest via automatic monthly investment you are committed to making regular monthly investments however your requirement usually extends only until you invest the amount that equals the minimum initial investment
4598864 for example if you choose to make automatic monthly investments in the disney plan you need to make those automatic investments until you reach disneys minimum initial investment amount of 1 000 that would mean a minimum of 10 monthly investments of 100 each
4598865 the following autopilot drip portfolio contains 10 quality stocks all of these companies permit initial purchases directly and all reduce their minimum initial investment amount if an investor agrees to automatic monthly investment via electronic debit of a bank account
4598866 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4598867 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4598868 have been primarily driven by rising fuel costs and our inability to pass these increases on to our customers due to a highly competitive market
4598869 this is a district that has been changing a lot over the last several years the number of new people in the district is huge and the people who have lived in the district are also changing
4598870 she doesnt have much of a political track record and she has staked out very left positions in a moderate district
4598871 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4598872 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4598873 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4598874 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4598875 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4598876 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4598877 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4598878 long before the democratic party was returning my phone calls
4598879 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4598880 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4598881 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4598882 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4598883 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary
4598884 i think you love that liverpool more than you love me
4598885 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4598886 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons

4598892 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4598893 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4598894 what we think is we need to have a real debate about the issue and that includes a real look at the costs of some of the policies being promoted
4598895 lets look at taking whatever revenue is derived from that and devote it entirely to tax relief
4598896 we think that there are solutions to whatever the climate crisis may be that are market based that dont involve increasing the size of government substantially
4598897 do we want to create a model where the solutions for dependence on oil come out of europe or asia and were sitting here in the u s because we want to argue for the status quo
4598898 the scientific data show the change is accelerating so when you do take measures the longer you delay the more aggressive those measures have to be
4598899 its important to address those issues sooner rather than later
4598900 if the united states congress would have the backbone enough to announce to this world that we are going to deregulate and we are going to begin to drill and refine american oil we would begin to see gas prices plummet
4598901 ive lent my crystal ball to someone so i cant give you the figure
4598902 i dont think there is a lot of worse news that could happen
4598903 if interest rates fall and the housing market picks up that would be positive once we get through an election get some stability that could be positive they all could be positive but they all might not
4598904 you might go to the supermarket and say to somebody what sort of potatoes are these and theyll say dirty ones out of the garden whereas id like to think that we might give you a more sincere and satisfactory answer
4598905 im not saying we go home and watch dvds about vegetables all night but weve got a little bit more of a speciality than a supermarket
4598906 the problem for retailers is such a high proportion of our costs are fixed you still have to pay your rent and youve still got to have people to open doors at the store
4598907 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins
4598908 that means you will also have less drug reaching the normal tissue
4598909 right now what we are doing is so called passive targeting which is using the leaky vasculature of the tumour but a more active targeting would be attaching a peptide or antibody to the nanotube drug one that will bind more specifically to the tumour which should further enhance the treatment efficacy
4598910 we are definitely hoping to be able to push this to practical applications into the clinic this is one step forward but it will still take time to truly prove the efficacy and the safety
4598911 many of the linux wireless tools have trouble when any encryption is involved
4598912 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4598913 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4598914 do you think these fellows would come this far and put their reputations and their jobs on the line if they didnt have what they say they have
4598915 its not on endangered species on any list that weve got
4598916 these robotic policemen wiped out all of cambridge in one day of carnage what have you got to say about that
4598917 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4598918 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4598919 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4598920 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4598921 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4598922 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4598923 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4598924 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair

4598929 i dont think its quite done but i heard that on the wind last year that they were trying to do it you know the whole thing with an escape they were working on a videogame where you plot your own escape from prison
4598930 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4598931 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4598932 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4598933 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4598934 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4598935 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4598936 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4598937 is it impossible for a woman to look professional in flats
4598938 then why not simply have a dress code that says don t come to work wearing leisure shoes
4598939 provided that the dress code is explained to prospective employees before they sign their contract
4598940 go ahead any company that would fire a senior manager for having a beard is not worth working for anyway
4598941 if your idea of a professional look on a woman includes stillettos i find that sorely lacking
4598942 nothing should ever come before a person s health and high heels are simply bad for your health

4598950 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4598951 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view

4598959 some students who need tap to pay for school could end up deeper in debt or unable to pay for school at all
4598960 just as bad students enrolled in opportunity programs could find the support structures theyve come to depend on severely weakened
4598961 given the pattern of the thing its not unreasonable for people to ask
4598962 the media and a large chunk of the public including some of johns supporters still question whether hes told the whole truth

4598983 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4598984 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4598985 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4598986 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4598987 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush

4598989 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4598990 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4598991 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4598992 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4598993 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4598994 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4598995 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender

4599009 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4599010 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4599011 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4599012 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers

4599015 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4599016 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4599017 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field

4599042 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4599043 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren

4599051 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4599052 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4599053 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4599054 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4599055 just so you all know we did set a record
4599056 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4599057 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4599058 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4599059 hed be a good man on a boat during a storm
4599060 obama does better against mccain with hunters and especially fisherpeople than did his two democratic predecessors vis a vis bush
4599061 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4599062 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4599063 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4599064 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4599065 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4599066 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4599067 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4599068 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4599069 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4599070 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4599071 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4599072 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4599073 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4599074 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4599075 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4599076 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4599077 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4599078 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4599079 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4599080 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4599081 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4599082 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4599083 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4599084 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4599085 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4599086 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4599087 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4599088 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4599089 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4599090 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4599091 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4599092 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4599093 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4599094 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
4599095 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial

4599104 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen

4599108 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4599109 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4599110 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4599111 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4599112 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4599113 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business

4599118 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4599119 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices

4599136 to have the entire class laugh and giggle when somebody pronounces niger as nigger the constant bombardment of that kind of thing really affects your spirit and its every single day like when people want to come back from a vacation and compare their tan to yours and joke about being black

4599145 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4599146 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4599147 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4599148 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4599149 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4599150 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4599151 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4599152 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal

4599156 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4599157 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4599158 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4599159 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4599160 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4599161 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4599162 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4599163 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4599164 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4599165 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4599166 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4599167 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4599168 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world

4599174 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4599175 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4599176 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4599177 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4599178 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4599179 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4599180 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4599181 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4599182 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4599183 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4599184 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4599185 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4599186 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
4599187 i often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about and express it in numbers you know something about it but when you cannot measure it when you cannot express it in numbers your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind

4599197 its a big loss for ordinary afghans people who benefit from those aid projects
4599198 areas that were secure last year are no longer secure
4599199 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4599200 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4599201 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4599202 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4599203 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4599204 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view

4599234 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
4599235 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
4599236 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid
4599237 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
4599238 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
4599239 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors

4599244 solved a long standing bathroom problem for global energy giant bp
4599245 i have no country to fight for my country is the earth and i am a citizen of the world
4599246 i am interested in good relations between the united states and russia but in the twenty first century nations dont invade other nations
4599247 for those who believe that you dont need tradition because you have the bible the christian tradition has sought to say you are not entitled to the beliefs you cherish about such things as the holy trinity without a sense of what you owe to those who worked this out for you
4599248 not because the icons are seen as magical objects but because in their presence you become aware that you are present to god and that god is working on you by his grace as he does in the lives and words of holy people supremely in the words of scripture and the person of jesus
4599249 they have been physically thrown down from the higher slopes
4599250 we begin to understand how our lives like those of moses and elijah may have meanings we cant know of in this present moment the real depth and significance of what we say or do now wont appear until more of the light of christ has been seen
4599251 the resurrection is a moment in which human beings are reintroduced to each other across the gulf of mutual resentment and blame a new human community becomes possible and similarly remembering the other figures from the first covenant in the background of the picture we realize that this community is unaffected by any division between the living and the dead david and solomon abraham moses elijah and isaiah are our contemporaries because of jesus resurrection
4599252 the mystery of the father is seen or encountered through the son and then seen or encountered as breathing out the spirit and that spirit leads us nowhere but back to the son to look into the mystery of the father is to be caught up in the fathers will and desire to bring the son to life over and over again in all the various forms in which the sons life is capable of being shared or imitated or echoed in creation so the life of the father is only to be understood as wholly directed to that breathing of the spirit which makes the son alive and real
4599253 ye hve not chosen me but i have chosen you
4599254 nosotros estamos muy comprometidos en tratar de reducir la cantidad de basura vamos a tratar de producir menos reciclar y darle una utilizaci n para tener que enterrar menos

4599258 tenemos que coordinar y trabajar en equipo la cantidad de problemas nos supera pero trabajando en equipo y coordinados se pueden comenzar a resolver nuestros problemas
4599259 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4599260 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4599261 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4599262 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4599263 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4599264 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4599265 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4599266 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4599267 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4599268 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4599269 given the pattern of the thing its not unreasonable for people to ask
4599270 the media and a large chunk of the public including some of johns supporters still question whether hes told the whole truth
4599271 happy to take a paternity test and would love to see it happen
4599272 i feel sorry for his family because how horrible but also dont you think he is the father of the child
4599273 anybody whos been around campaigns knows that folks come and go
4599274 we always listen to the public in terms of its figure selection process we will not make a prime minister until after the general election
4599275 democrats are convinced that we can fix this shortfall without radically changing the program just as we did in 1983
4599276 those who claim that social security is broke and cant be fixed have a solution that fulfills their prophecy
4599277 hes taken more of a dynamic role within the party
4599278 hes always been against privatization its just that hes never been a position that his voice carried more weight
4599279 the obama spratt plan to shore up social security for our seniors is higher taxes
4599280 if were going to fix the problem both sides need to come together in a good faith effort
4599281 in fact it could destroy the system under the pretense of saving it
4599282 heres a baby to busy yourself with so dont worry your pretty little head about it now
4599283 a child now in my family for whom i can now care
4599284 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
4599285 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
4599286 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
4599287 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
4599288 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
4599289 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
4599290 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
4599291 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4599292 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
4599293 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4599294 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4599295 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4599296 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4599297 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4599298 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4599299 it supports the communist chinese regime and or the eeeevil capitalist visa hegemony
4599300 like hell she got back up and if she keeps at it even if she falls on her ass 1000 more times she might have learned enough to get good enough to amount to something
4599301 i want to speak i want to speak i am a journalist
4599302 triumph of the will is about the nuremberg rallies and congress
4599303 joe will make a serious international opener in the near future

4599305 weve lost robbie and there is speculation about berba so the boss is obviously going to bring someone else in
4599306 i dont want to take anything for granted because i know what happened last year
4599307 it was quite a whack to my confidence after playing really well it could come to friday night and we buy two new strikers and they play so until kick off on saturday im not taking anything for granted ill be rubbing my eyes when i see the teamsheet
4599308 some of the criticism was unjustified but people will write what they want to write
4599309 but there wasnt one period when i sulked i signed a big contract here so i always knew that eventually my time would come
4599310 i want to prove a lot of people wrong after last season i have a point to prove because i didnt really play much or score as many goals as i would have liked for my own self esteem i want to show what i can do
4599311 someone texted me to say my name was all over the papers about an england call up but because of last season ive put england out of my head i got on with things but now its resurfaced
4599312 if you score more than the next guy then you deserve to be called up i think the best players should play its not been like that in recent times but that is the thought in my head if i keep scoring they cant keep me out
4599313 in the year 2050 what would be your ideal goal for nasa

4599316 richard nixon was known as the man who would cut and slash the opposition and so that kind of dirty politics work would be done by nixon
4599317 lyndon johnson was the man and he delivered texas which helped john kennedy in a very close race
4599318 tiene la desgracia o quiz s la gran fortuna de estar en una banda con dos chicos
4599319 sabemos que ellos juegan bien aunque no tengan la calidad de otros equipos
4599320 ya hemos jugado contra ellos y sabemos que lo hace bien aunque no tenga la calidad de otros equipos
4599321 hicimos un gran partido esper bamos jugar as muy duro uno nunca espera sacar tanta diferencia en un choque de estas caracter sticas ante un rival como croacia que tambi n se jugaba much simo como nosotros
4599322 nosotros defendimos muy bien con mucha intensidad ellos se sintieron inc modos no tuvieron la efectividad habitual en sus tiros y ah se arm una bola de nieve
4599323 to immediately join us and rally in support of this wonderful family
4599324 is felt by the entire mississippi gulf coast as well as the larger law enforcement family throughout the world these officers serve us day and night 365 days a year and we should return some of that respect and devotion by offering the curry family our assistance they need us
4599325 cant believe i shaved for this i mean what am i even doing here who cares about bob saget

4599327 no i really like her shes a really good girlfriend
4599328 you should try that i think thatd be good for you
4599329 its bitterly disappointing because we had seven judo players who i firmly believe had medal chances
4599330 they were well prepared and they all gave 100 per cent but it just didnt happen on the day
4599331 i cant really say that anything specific went wrong but there was inconsistent refereeing and even a major power like russia came away without a medal and they spend 10 million euros on their programme however i dont wish to harp on about that
4599332 well be appointing a head coach recruiting new staff and evaluating the athletes
4599333 all human beings make a subconscious judgment about an item within 90 seconds of initial viewing and that between 62 and 90 of that assessment is based on color alone
4599334 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4599335 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4599336 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4599337 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
4599338 stop walking about like youve lost your last dollar get out there and score some runs
4599339 seans one of the best guys there is a funny guy always positive so it was really rough for the family
4599340 my father woke me up around quarter of 5 in the morning and asked me to come out to the living room of my apartment and my mother and a local officer were there and they told me the news right away and it just destroyed me
4599341 watching him graduate really influenced me to become a marine and thats why i am today
4599342 this was actually going to be the first christmas we were all together in five or six years
4599343 about 8 last night our oldest brother peter and his wife alissa gave birth to twin boys
4599344 they lost one of five boys and its something no parent should have to do
4599345 he was very dedicated and motivated and he accomplished everything he wanted to
4599346 he like actually talks to the kids have conversations with them actually communicates with them other than the other cops who will stop by and be like put on your helmet
4599347 he was just a funny guy and he was always nice to everybody
4599348 they wouldnt be afraid to go up and talk to him and he wasnt afraid to go up and talk to them
4599349 he was mature enough like a police officer but he was also young enough to be able to communicate with the kids
4599350 i guess its a good thing what he said to do
4599351 you should go on and live each day like its your last because obviously it might be
4599352 and if anyone does ask what hes done to himself to need all of those bandages
4599353 we know that the russian government controls those servers theoretically if they have not been pwned by somebody else
4599354 while some are speculating about cyber warfare and state sponsorship we have no data to indicate anything of the sort at this time we are seeing some botnets some well known and some not so well known take aim at georgia websites
4599355 compared to the may 2007 estonian attacks these are more intense but have lasted so far for less time this could be due to a number of factors including more sizeable botnets with more bandwidth better bandwidth at the victims changes in our observations or other factors
4599356 in the early hours of military operations in south ossetia we decided to move abkhazian troops to the abkha zian border with georgia in order to draw georgian forces away from south ossetia
4599357 we also launched an operation to push georgian forces out of khodori gorge
4599358 despite the fact that a ceasefire agreement has been made between the russian president and georgian president mikhail saaka shvili russian armed forces unfortunately remain on georgian territory
4599359 had turned from the tbilisi direction the residents of tbilisi are not under any threat
4599360 no other problem in russias foreign policy is so crucial for its internal security as the southern caucasus region
4599361 in the 1990s some 70 000 south ossetian refugees poured into north ossetia that is roughly 16 percent of north ossetias population these people who were without work played a role in the first conflict on russian territory between north ossetia and ingushetia
4599362 saakashvili is not a madman and he had a reason to do what he did
4599363 block russias foreign policy in regards to its response to nato aspirations of georgia and urkaine
4599364 his administration actively supported saakashvilis rise to power and bush has obligations before saakashvili just as russia has obligations before the south ossetian government
4599365 in terms of the information war russia is in a very unfavorable position because its impossible the change the inevitable view of it
4599366 just look at a map there is tiny georgia and here is russia and it appears obvious who the bad guy is
4599367 it puts an end to the post soviet region as we know it a fundamentally new stage is beginning a war between two countries so close culturally historically and humanly its a tragedy no matter who is to blame
4599368 some have learnt many tricks of sly evasion instead of truth they use equivocation and eke it out with mental reservation which is to good men an abomination
4599369 i saw a georgian soldier throw a grenade into a basement full of women and children
4599370 some have learnt many tricks of sly evasion instead of truth they use equivocation and eke it out with mental reservation which is to good men an abomination
4599371 we went down into a bunker everything was already burning grad rockets began coming down in great numbers it killed lots of people there was blood everywhere
4599372 you wouldnt believe that this is a spot where a person was almost killed
4599373 the fire was so bad people werent even left with a handkerchief

4599379 a lot of different things will be argued about this case from both sides but the one thing we do know for sure thats not arguable is the fact that he signed this deal indicating that this company was free and clear of lawsuits and then midway through the case we find out he was mired in a major lawsuit over the assets of the company we would never have moved forward with this deal knowing what we know today
4599380 we had high hopes for the both the relationship and the technology provided by xflix llc however the assets and services failed us time and time again which is why we had to move away from their platform and onto our own proprietary one
4599381 persuading her to leave the retail division and join the film team to work along side me to help continue to grow the brand name and dvd sales of harmony films is a great coup
4599382 i worked with my partner in crime jason maskell at the venus show in berlin last year and got a taste for sales and marketing while there
4599383 i was offered the position by the director of harmony steve elvins and jumped at the opportunity i am very pleased and honoured to be given the chance to progress from retail to sales and marketing and ive been enjoying every minute
4599384 i found myself around a lot of lesbian amp bi sexual girls and i thought it was time for the rest of the world to get some real perspective on the matter

4599389 for the first time we have possible evidence that medications can modify the decline in lung function in copd
4599390 also demonstrates that no treatment placebo is not an option for patients with moderate to severe copd
4599391 quite clear it must be the long acting agonist bronchodilator
4599392 effect of pharmacotherapy on rate of decline of lung function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease results from the torch study
4599393 medications to modify lung function decline in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease some hopeful signs
4599394 george bushs administration is promoting interests of candidate john mccain
4599395 defeated by barak obama on all fronts mccain has one last card to play yet the creation of a virtual cold war with russia bush himself did not want a war in south ossetia but his republican party did not leave him any choice
4599396 the west has spent a lot of time energy and money to teach georgia the tricks of the trade to make the country look like a democracy
4599397 we and many other nations see through this deceit we understand that the seditious tactics of the so called colour revolutions are a real threat to international law and the source of global legal nihilism
4599398 in the old days under soviet rule we didnt believe a word of our own propaganda but we thought that information was free in the west and we longed for it
4599399 but we have learnt since that the west has its own propaganda and in some ways it is more powerful because people believe it
4599400 city turns into human hell many people still trapped under rubble
4599401 we have learnt from western tv how to simplify the narrative
4599402 some have learnt many tricks of sly evasion instead of truth they use equivocation and eke it out with mental reservation which is to good men an abomination
4599403 the consequences of low specific excess power in comparison to the threat are poor climb rates poor sustained turn capability and a low maximum speed of greatest tactical significance is the lower maximum speed of the f a 18e f since this precludes the ability to avoid or disengage from aerial combat in this regard the f a 18e f is only marginally inferior to the f a 18c d whose specific excess power is also considerably inferior to that of the primary threat the mig 29
4599404 worried about what it is that we do not know

4599411 edward had always thought that he belonged to the world of horror stories of course id known he was dead wrong it was obvious that he belonged here in a fairy tale
4599412 i gasped and then struggled with my vocabulary unable to find the right words i needed better words
4599413 all i knew was loving my little nudger inside of me outside of me she seemed like something i must have imagined
4599414 there were georgian attacks overnight but our troops are in full control of the city so far weve had no orders to move south into georgia
4599415 there was a great wave of pressure which twisted me and flung me against the kitchen wall
4599416 this land is my body my home we are a proud beautiful people and we are not leaving i survived i am alive
4599417 we are raising a toast to those who are left
4599418 those tanks in the street we hit them with rocket propelled grenades from the basement
4599419 the georgians were 30 times stronger than us they wanted to kill us to destroy everything but we held them off
4599420 those who perpetrated this horror are criminals who must be punished by god this war is a result of georgian fascism which has flourished with the support of the west
4599421 is the help we received from russia which do you think we should chose
4599422 ive never heard anything so monstrous as people shelling a hospital
4599423 we managed to escape to the shelter just in time
4599424 the georgians could not get tanks through these narrow streets so first they turned it to ruins with a grad attack and tried to punch through here to the centre of the city there was heavy fighting in the streets i think more than 500 bodies were pulled out of this part of town
4599425 i personally saw one man beheaded lying in the street and others say they witnessed civilians who had been finished off with a shot to the back of the head
4599426 some have learnt many tricks of sly evasion instead of truth they use equivocation and eke it out with mental reservation which is to good men an abomination
4599427 his skin was the colour of polished walnut and a length of burgundy cotton had been wound around his head the fabric falling in folds to his shoulders he wore a silver belt and heavy silver bracelets on his dark forearms and his scimitar was richly damascened with his long straight nose and his keen black eyes he looked like a bird of prey capable controlled and ruthless cat thought and she felt a chill run through her
4599428 like a mindless automaton i found myself walking toward him and then my head was resting on his shoulder and i could smell the ironed linen smell of his shirt and a trace of his usual cologne heated by his body beneath he cupped my head against him and i felt the beat of his pulse quicken
4599429 barbary corsair raids on the south coasts of england which took place intermittently over the course of more than two hundred years during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries have been increasingly well documented over the past few years

4599438 this one tends to get slighted by a lot of critics and kurosawa fans but i thought it was wonderful its an episodic multi character study of tokyos poorest who live in a city literally made from garbage though it looks like an a bomb just hit the film has a sort of serene beauty thanks to the glorious use of technicolor the title comes from the sound made by the insane young man who drives an imaginary trolley through the slum all the characters were wonderful and all the stories engrossing but perhaps the most tragic concerns the man and his young son who live in an abandoned car when not searching for food they spend their spare time using their imagination to build their dream house an emotionally moving and beautiful film
4599439 from just a cinematographic point of view kurosawas mastery of colour is unrivaled and a sound reason to watch this film yet not the only one by far
4599440 this is an absolute treasure of a film a love letter to nagasaki an opportunity to see how deeply the atom bomb affected japanese culture an opportunity to see a number of the landmarks of the attack and edited so wonderfully kurosawa always highly prized being able to tell the the story in images alone and understood how composition of shots increases content and this movie has some very quiet sober shots that hit really really hard it shows how we can fail to see things that are right under our noses for years and years how things can happen that you never get over
4599441 when i saw this movie i remembered louis ferdinand celines book
4599442 we wont forget the bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki and akira kurosawa makes sure of that but not with a revengeful attitude rather as a reminder to all humanity that we must care for each other and respect one another because the consequences of not doing so will be paid by all human beings

4599445 practices in the heat and humidity probably help as much mentally as they do anything else
4599446 it puts us through conditions that clearly we know the games are going to be conducted in from a mental conditioning standpoint it has as much application as it does from a physical standpoint
4599447 the other side of it is that this time frame under any circumstances is quite a grind on the players physically at the end of the second straight week of practice we probably are able to get a little better performance from the players at this stage of practice than if they were worn down by the weather as well as the grind
4599448 this clearly is an example of the old saying about the apple not falling too far from the tree
4599449 because chase has the same focus and the same competitiveness that his dad did
4599450 chase has a real good field presence and a real sense of whats going on around him
4599451 one thing that really helps the quarterback at the start up point of his career is a real good running game
4599452 weve got two real good runners and the way for us to build on our strength and take advantage of our proven personnel is to be able to establish the run early in the season

4599479 everyone thinks these parents are bad or strung out on drugs but parents whove lost their kids in these types of accidents include pediatricians doctors school principals lawyers and nasa engineers
4599480 for the most part these are highly educated extremely loving and doting parents
4599481 in the early 90s these cases were rare but then in the mid 90s front passenger airbags were installed in cars and there was a huge campaign to get kids to move to the back seat an unintended consequence of this was kids dying of hyperthermia in cars because children were out of sight out of mind

4599496 the first thing i did was i interviewed 200 women one of the questions that i asked all of them was do you feel attractive and only two said yes so it hit me that its possible that 99 percent of women are just walking the streets randomly not feeling good about themselves

4599511 despite a recent weakening of home buying conditions the economic and demographic growth of the past year will help sustain quebec housing demand at relatively high levels this year and next as the provinces economy grows thanks to domestic spending and investment recent job growth and disposable income increases will continue to fuel demand while the strong canadian dollar has stimulated private investment government infrastructure projects and tax cuts will be a key source of economic growth in the near term
4599512 the outlook for the provinces export sector remains weak as the current exchange rate growing foreign competition and decreased foreign demand this will be especially true of the manufacturing sector continue to erode gdp growth we thus expect the quebec economy to grow by 0 9 per cent this year and under two per cent in 2009 while job growth registers approximately one per cent
4599513 as the provinces economy continues to grow and the provincial government increases its immigration targets net migration will strengthen in the coming years moreover population aging will continue to fuel demand this and the relatively low level of mortgage rates shall translate into 46 500 starts in 2008 and over 45 000 the following year

4599606 fees which range from 6 95 at rogers and telus corp to 8 95 at bell canada inc and are the subject of a similar class action suit that was certified in saskatchewan last year
4599607 there are strong spirits there that is a powerful place
4599608 there is no selfishness which is at the bottom of civilization
4599609 how can you save the earth if you have no spiritual relationship with the earth
4599610 there is an intellectual abstraction about the environment but no visceral participation with the earth
4599611 to us when your land is gone you are walking toward a slow spiritual death
4599612 we have come to the point that death is better than living without your spirituality
4599613 i wonder by what means the mountains will be made to be alive
4599614 we believe that in the beginning creatures had the ability to change shape from animal to human from human to animal
4599615 so we learned that you had to be careful what you said you never knew if you were talking to a human or animal
4599616 we said wed watch over it because thats our responsibility
4599617 we have these earthquakes and other natural disasters because people are poisoning their mother the earth they are poisoning her bloodstreams and cutting off her hair theyre not following the laws about caring for the earth
4599618 if an area is destroyed marred or polluted my people say the spirits will leave there
4599619 time has a spatial extension that which once happened literally took place and still has a place
4599620 it scared me when i was on that ridge for i felt unktehi
4599621 singled out for preservation while the surrounding landscape which the place both gives significance power to and takes significance from is destroyed
4599622 so are you going up there to fast when you get up there could you ask those spirits to come down and give me some rain for my crops
4599623 to me that is like a small example of the power of those mountains
4599624 since time immemorial the sweet grass hills was one of the focal points of our tribe to seek out spiritual guidance a spiritual sense of belonging
4599625 its like when you make medicine to cure some one
4599626 if you are missing one ingredient it wont work thats how it is with the sweet grass hills our medicine ceremonies prayers without the hills none of it will be as effective
4599627 these hills are not just sacred in one place every bit of those mountains are sacred
4599628 that owners of the mines will change their minds and see that these mountains are just as alive as anybody and that they want to live too we pray that they will respect that sanctity of life and the spirituality of those hills
4599629 have responded to the rhythms of the land the degree to which they have become indigenous
4599630 this is changing womans land only she can say its my land

4599634 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4599800 our judgement is that we dont regard the swinton circle as being in the same category as the monday club as part of the review of groups associated with the conservative party and the association with the party is pretty loose we have looked into other groups besides the monday club and we dont think there is a problem with the swinton circle

4599825 when this requirement came up we had to figure out how do we make this happen quickly
4599826 we had to get the georgian troops back and sustain what we have going in iraq and afghanistan
4599827 in the 36 hours from notification to when we started flying missions it all came together
4599828 it was a total teamwork effort from a planning perspective
4599829 it was also a great team effort on the part of aircrew members maintainers and loaders
4599830 i think we had about 36 to 48 hours to plan this
4599831 we got wind of the mission and began working closely with our contacts at u s european command
4599832 we wanted the missions to be fast visible and effective
4599833 we work with our customers across the globe and depending on what needs to be moved and how quickly it needs to be there we will find the right mode of transportation
4599834 sealift is a possibility and we are working with the navys military sealift command to examine the possibilities
4599835 in this case in a two day effort there was hardly any impact on sustainment operations or deployments in iraq afghanistan or elsewhere
4599836 had it been a longer term operation over time there would be some degradation but that would not happen to troops in contact
4599837 to my mind the real beauty of it was our young men and women who maintain and launch and load and fly these airplanes that they were able to respond and make this move happen
4599838 they took a chance because thats what they were called to do and they did a phenomenal job
4599839 it all boils down to we have a mission to do and we do it
4599840 our motto out here is a promise made is a promise kept in this case america made a promise to an ally and we kept that promise
4599841 kami mencari nyale cacing laut kalau dapat banyak berarti rejeki tahun ini banyak
4599842 ini tradisi dari dulu sejak kecil orang tua saya pun selalu mengajak saya mencari nyale setiap tahun
4599843 dalam pesan legenda itu putri mandalika akan memunculkan diri tepat pada tanggal 20 bulan 10 kalender sasak dan laut di maksud adalah pantai seger di desa kuta ini nah saat para leluhur kami mencarinya di tanggal itu ternyata yang ditemukan adalah nyale atau cacing laut karena itulah masyarakat percaya bahwa nyale ini adalah penjelmaan mandalika
4599844 embe taokmu mandalika bahasa sasak berarti dimana engkau berada mandalika
4599845 ini luar biasa saya berlibur ke lombok tetapi saya mendapatkan ekstra melihat tradisi ini ada banyak sekali orang tetapi damai saya juga mencari nyale tapi tidak dapat
4599846 puncak acara sebenarnya 26 27 karena saat itulah tradisi bau nyale dilakukan masyarakat ini pesta rakyat tahunan yang ternyata menarik minat wisata
4599847 jumlah pengunjung dan masyarakat yang ada di pantai seger kami taksir belasan ribu yang terlibat bau nyale
4599848 yang luar biasa dari tradisi ini adalah kebersamaannya saya melihat begitu banyak masyarakat berkumpul tetapi tidak ada gangguan keamanan semua bersama dan damai saya piker pesan moral dalam legenda mandalika ini bias ditiru bai kehidupan berbangsa dan bernegara kita di indonesia semangat pengorbanan demi persatuan

4599856 j roddy walston amp the business is to almost the exclusion of all others the purest american rock and roll band ive heard in years i love them because we share a common often laughed off belief rock and roll matters
4599857 its hard not to fawn over just how fantastic the band is how captivating and electric walston is as a frontman as he pounds his piano and screeches away without sounding like jon landau raving about the first time he saw bruce springsteen
4599858 theyre loud relentess and wear you out before theyre even halfway done with you
4599859 when it comes to pure unadulterated rock music there arent nearly enough bands these days that do it the way j roddy does
4599860 nobody rocks as hard as j roddy walston and the business watching these guys perform is like watching a live bull fight with audiences dancing for their lives in the aisles
4599861 what takes them to the level of awesome is the street wise working class attitude that infects each of these numbers if its folk then its tough folk if were talking rhythm and soul its tough rhythm and soul and if were talking rock n roll you guessed it its tough

4599880 i not only felt i was blindsided by what was taking place but this board was acting not so much like a judge and jury but to me more like a kangaroo court
4599881 the actions of this board in looking to satisfy the concerns of the fire personnel on some comments i made at a brush fire at my residence have now become completely political in nature and represent little more than character assassination

4599900 we are right now suffering because we want to be free and we want to be a democracy multi ethnic democracy that belongs to all ethnic groups and thats exactly whats happening there so basically i have to i mean its not about georgia anymore its about america its values you know i went to two u s universities i always taught that these values were also those of my own we have held them not because we love america although i do love america but because we love freedom and the point here is that i also taught that america also stands up for those free loving nations and supports them
4599901 we are a freedom loving nation that is right now under attack
4599902 we have to stand up for freedom and democracy as we did in the darkest days

4599904 is the slow motion counterattack of the orthodox world against the wests latest crusade georgia is just a symbol for the counter punch to the modern version of the wests sack of constantinople in 1204
4599905 the lesson from 2q2008 gmv is ebays business is too large and complex to rapidly reinvigorate especially in a challenging macro climate causing consumers to trade down
4599906 we think ebay faces structural issues that may lead to significant operating margin contraction if the company needs to spend in ads demand growth lower seller fees and re invest in r amp d interface note the strategy of increasing sellers fees and couponing has not improved underlying metrics while recent initiatives may not be enough to carry the business in 08
4599907 in our view key operating metrics continue to reveal that the companys core franchise is losing mindshare and marketshare at a rapid pace and that a much hyped turnaround in it is still very much a work in progress moreover we continue to believe that uncertainty and competition may increase for the company in 2h 08 with the prospect of further transitions in its business model as well as the possibility of a paypal esque product introduction from amazon com

4599910 the u s european command said on monday that there were no plans at this time to withdraw the u s military trainers from the country there are still 127 u s trainers in georgia where the american forces had been preparing the georgian army for operations in iraq eucom stated that they are not engaged in the conflict and are removed from where the fighting is happening
4599911 this is just another example of the flexibility of airpower
4599912 im real proud of the ability of our airmen to orchestrate a movement such as this
4599913 we are supporting the georgian military units that are in iraq in their redeployment to georgia so that they can support requirements there during the current security situation
4599914 flights have in fact begun today and georgian forces are redeploying
4599915 i have no doubt they wanted to target the pipeline there is nothing else here
4599916 it was terribly intense the smell of cordite spread everywhere i had to abandon my car and hide in a ditch but the jets werent interested in other targets
4599917 at the moment the pipeline is not running at any capacity because there was a fire

4599921 today i signed the ceasefire agreement i have to specify this is a ceasefire agreement this is not a final settlement we are under russian invasion and russian occupation right now
4599922 that he was also going to sign the accord and that russia would scrupulously respect its commitments on this agreement notably confirming the withdrawal of russian forces
4599923 it is unlikely that ossetians and abkhazians will be able to live with georgians in one state
4599924 the problem is in ossetians and abkhazians themselves because they dont trust any other peacekeepers except russians
4599925 because all the previous history of 15 years showed that the only troops that were able to defend their interests and life were only russian forces and thats why they think russian force is the only guarantor of their peace
4599926 the response from russia also if you take into account the course of events was sometimes disproportionate and it is why i urge and i believe that the six point plan must be realised immediately so that the russian troops should withdraw from the georgian we always say the centre zone well outside of abkhazia and south ossetia

4599931 the only way for mccain and the republican party to play catch up is to raise for the rnc and use president bush as the attraction
4599932 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4599933 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4599934 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4599935 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4599936 until somebody else emerges as the party leader the former guy is going to be a big draw
4599937 mikheil saakashvilis decision to use the opening of the olympic games to cover georgias invasion of its breakaway province of south ossetia must rank in stupidity with gamal decision to close the straits of tiran to israeli ships

4599982 im from kharbut i was born in kharbut i died in the embassy bombing with her
4599983 maybe i shouldnt have brought you so soon the next meeting isnt for another two weeks though and i thought this would help you get used to it here meeting your neighbors
4599984 why what are they doing here anyway isnt this heaven how can people like that get to heaven especially him how can you let a terrorist into heaven dont you believe in rewarding the good and punishing the evil this is just i cant believe this this cant be happening
4599985 everyone is housed with the people they died with everyone who died at the same time you died lives on your floor everyone who died the same week as you lives in this building
4599986 but what are they doing here in the first place isnt this heaven dont you have to do things right to get here
4599987 havent you ever heard the road to hell is paved with the best intentions
4599988 so youll let just anybody in no matter what they did if their intentions are good
4599989 your logic seems to have its basis somewhere other than reality
4599990 people are judged by their intentions in order to get here
4599991 we do this because people dont have very good instructions about what is right and what is wrong
4599992 what do you mean right and wrong are common sense
4599993 right and wrong vary from culture to culture and religion to religion what is for some people common sense is confusing for other people and while we try to broadcast instructions there is always something lost or gained in the translation
4599994 up here there is no sickness pain sadness or death the instructions we broadcast are meant to help people make life down there more like life up here unfortunately the only people who are capable of receiving our broadcasts are psychotic this means that not only must the psychotic person understand these instructions for what they are which is difficult in itself but he must be able to relay these instructions to others who must also be able to understand these instructions for what they are what usually happens though is that some psychotic ramblings are taken for instructions and some instructions are taken for psychotic ramblings
4599995 so the people that wrote the bible were crazy i cant believe that
4599996 that doesnt explain why there is a terrorist up here
4599997 well look at it this way life is tough he did his best
4599998 since we are unable to give people clear instructions we give them the benefit of the doubt he chose a set of instructions that he believed were right he was convinced that god wanted him to act the way he acted in order for him to get into heaven he was sure he was doing right and thats why he is here if he had accepted a different set of instructions as right but then didnt follow those instructions he would not be here
4599999 each person sees what he thinks is right and what he thinks is wrong if he sees right and does it he comes here if he sees wrong and does that he doesnt come here all of us here have done the best we could with the instructions we had
