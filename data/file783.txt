7830020 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7830021 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7830022 i come here as a daughter raised on the south side of chicago by a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me
7830023 you know what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did
7830024 barack stood up that day and he spoke words that have stayed with me ever since
7830025 she said adding that too often people were forced to settle for the first
7830026 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me

7830033 i ask all the protesters who have been blockading or occupying government offices that you still have a chance to withdraw and go back to your homes
7830034 i will not resign i will stay to protect this country
7830035 the military will not allow the protesters to take control of the country however it is not the time yet for military force
7830036 the easiest way to restore normalcy is for prime minister samak to quit
7830037 if we do not receive a clear and positive response we will prolong the rally to the next day and mobilise more protesters
7830038 the military will not stage a coup detat the public must not panic and must carry on their daily lives the army will not get involved in politics

7830050 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
7830051 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers

7830086 some people seem to think that the vision should be a document that includes all the detail around the business case outline plan and other elements for me that is the kick off document and it is something that has a life expectancy of only about three weeks when everyone is on board and you are into the detail the vision for me is something very clear that says what we are going to achieve for the business how will we measure success and what is important to delivery

7830222 that has inspired me for 2010 knowing its canadas chance to do the same take some serious pride in our countrys performance and get behind everyone like weve never done before as a nation
7830223 i have watched pretty much all of it anytime i am at home the tv is on even watched french cbc they show some events that we dont see much of on the english side
7830224 very inspired by ian millar after nine olympics or 10 considering the boycott finally an olympic medal talk about perserverance
7830225 revved up certainly i have had a little more energy these two weeks in training us older guys need all the help we can get
7830226 my tv is never really off during the olympics just muted sometimes and i am definitely lacking sleep from staying up too late watching its awesome to wake up and eat my breakfast to our athletes competing it totally inspires me to get my butt to the gym
7830227 i was actually jumping up and down in my apartment when simon whitfield made his huge comeback to win silver
7830228 recovering from an injury surgery starts to eat at you physically and mentally
7830229 despatie perseverance after a tough season and great mental toughness
7830230 i would have to go with jeannie longo ciprelli of france in cycling for my inspiration here
7830231 to see her here long after that still racing and not just to be a participant but to be here to perform was amazing she turns 50 on oct 31 this year and this is me 12 years later now 35 and having a lot of people constantly asking me if im retiring or if im still speed skating
7830232 im full on training harder than ever before more focused and now more inspired seeing longo ciprelli come in fourth in the time trial and missing a medal by 1 6 seconds that tells me what i already know that im definitely not too old at 35
7830233 i am training in argentina and as a result watching the games have been difficult there were so many great stories from our canadian olympians watching the olympics and our canadian team has energized me
7830234 gymnast kyle shewfelt is a champion who inspired me beyond sport kyle succeeded against such tremendous odds his dedication hard work and above all his positive attitude have set an incredible example
7830235 i cant wait to buy the box set of the olympics and watch it when i get home
7830236 i am watching the games as much as my own life and training schedule allow the most inspiring performance for me simon whitfield to watch him be so patient and tactical throughout his race was amazing and then to watch him get dropped coming into the stadium area was heart wrenching
7830237 from an athlete toiling in the off season doldrums it was fantastic to witness such a motivating effort thanks simon
7830238 i actually just got back from new zealand where i was skiing for the past 3 weeks for the past 10 days i have been watching the olympics every free moment i have
7830239 whether it was down in new zealand or back home in fernie the games have captivated my attention from the get go and they have drawn me into my journey for an olympic medal in 2010
7830240 the stories of these athletes are so real so genuine and so original that it inspires me to dream bigger and better i actually think that by watching these games it has really put me in the olympic spirit for 2010
7830241 it was so great in new zealand to come back from a day on the slopes plop myself on my bed or the couch and be captivated for hours by sport although not a lot of the canadian athletes performances were shown on new zealand television the ones that were made me proud
7830242 i remember cheering like a banshee with teammate larisa yurkiw when ryan cochrane the swimmer earned his bronze medal it was not only the canadian performances that touched me i was nearly brought to tears when the womens marathon winner entered the stadium to a crowd of 91 000 people how powerful is that
7830243 was i watching of course i seriously live and breathe sport so being able to turn my tv on at 6 a m in the morning and have live action is my tv dreams coming true
7830244 i watched at home before morning training and for the last half hour of the coverage during lunch
7830245 simon no question inspired me the most his will and determination was impressive ive also been reading his blog so his preparation impressed me and i had total confidence he would will himself to the finish after reading about all the work he did in his little preparation shed
7830246 i was also really impressed with the chinese gymnasts in the all around competition and their divers i thought home crowd might affect one or two of them but you could see that they were so well prepared that they absolutely embraced the chance to show it off
7830247 it gave me some motivation to make sure i am doing my tough tricks every day well so that when i am in the moment i know that its easy ive done it every day in training for the last two years
7830248 it also made me feel the need to buckle down i felt the olympic stress all the way here in canada through my tv screen a reminder of how quickly it comes is always nice especially when you have 538 days i love the countdown widget left to make sure you are completely ready
7830249 i have stepped outside of reality for 16 days as i am obsessed with the summer olympics it started with all of the olympic trials thank goodness for my pvr at home so i can stay updated on my own time
7830250 i have to admit i had a hard time finding anything out about our canadian athletes with olympic trials so i was caught up on the american drama heading into beijing
7830251 i was inspired every time i was witnessing an athlete put it all on the line
7830252 i cried watching mike brown finish fourth in the 200m breaststroke my heart broke when i saw him look up at the board after his race i could relate to his experience except things turned around for me in torino
7830253 ive been trying to learn as much as possible from all of the athletes in any sort of situation good or bad whenever i see someone passionate about what they do it gives me goosebumps and inspires me to want to be better not only at sport but as a person
7830254 the main disappointment is that the argentineans are great at soccer womens field hockey and not so strong at paddling wrestling and many of the other sports canadians excel at
7830255 while wind turbines are presented as minor encroachments that stand benignly on our bog land the opposite is the truth
7830256 apart from the disastrous breaking of the hard mineral pan that supports the bog the fabric of our blanket bog land is being rent asunder by the roads built to each turbine
7830257 unlike the midlands the bog here north kerry is blanket it lies on the hills holding water like a sponge and local experience and knowledge is ignored when dealing with it in favour of engineers who never walked a moorland never mind worked it

7830263 the research raises the perception both of how common these events are and specifically where they may occur
7830264 today with so many more buildings and people a magnitude 5 centered below the city would be extremely attention getting
7830265 wed see billions in damage with some brick buildings falling people would probably be killed
7830266 we need to step backward from the simple old model where you worry about one large obvious fault like they do in california
7830267 the problem here comes from many subtle faults we now see there is earthquake activity on them each one is small but when you add them up they are probably more dangerous than we thought we need to take a very close look
7830268 the probability is not zero and the damage could be great
7830269 it could be like something out of a greek myth
7830270 indian point is situated at the intersection of the two most striking linear features marking the seismicity and also in the midst of a large population that is at risk in case of an accident
7830271 this is clearly one of the least favorable sites in our study area from an earthquake hazard and risk perspective
7830272 new data developed in the last 20 years disclose a substantially higher likelihood of significant earthquake activity in the vicinity of indian point that could exceed the earthquake design for the facility
7830273 nothing happens for a while then it goes with a bang
7830274 is a major substantiation of a feature that bears on the long term earthquake risk of the northeastern united states
7830275 it gives us the best possible evidence that we have an earthquake hazard here that should be a factor in any planning decision it crystallizes the argument that this hazard is not random there is a structure to the location and timing of the earthquakes this enables us to contemplate risk in an entirely different way and since we are able to do that we should be required to do that
7830276 new york is not as prone to earthquakes as california and japan but they do happen this study takes a more realistic look at the possibility of larger ones and why earthquakes concentrate in certain places to understand risk you have to multiply hazard by assets and vulnerability when you factor that in our risk is high too much attention has been paid to the level of hazard and not enough to the risk earthquake hazard is about the same today as in 1609 when henry hudson sailed up the river but earthquake risk is much much higher today since the number of people assets and their vulnerability are so much greater
7830277 we think that the intersection of these two features being so close to indian point makes it a place of greater risk than most other points on the map
7830278 most people underestimate the hazard here any conservative approach will look at geologically similar environments if you do that we are similar to bhuj india where a 2001 magnitude 7 quake killed over 15 000 people there was no obvious sign of strain there there is a mystery here to be solved and we better step back and do our homework
7830279 once you accept that one fault in a family is active you better consider that all the faults in that family could be active we need to adapt our structures with that in mind
7830280 you could debate whether a magnitude 6 or 7 is possible but weve already had three magnitude fives so that is very realistic there is no one now alive now to remember that last one so people tend to forget and having only a partial 300 year history we may not have seen everything we could see there could be surprises things bigger than we have ever seen
7830281 these rat model tumors were developed from human glioblastoma tumor cells and closely mimic human tumors in growth patterns and response to therapy
7830282 the concept of targeting blood vessels that feed tumors as an approach to limit tumor growth is not a novel idea
7830283 however blocking the specific fatty acid described in this study is novel and holds great promise for use in humans
7830284 if survival time could be extended with a combination of surgical therapy and infusion with similar drugs this could be a significant treatment option
7830285 these pumps have been used in humans for other diseases and can be designed for delivery of these drugs as well
7830286 we believe they can be used to deliver drugs to block angiogenesis in complex human tumors such as glioblastomas

7830292 adem s la iglesia cat lica mantiene en su m s alto nivel un di logo ecum nico y plural con otras confesiones por lo que podr a desarrollarse un acto multiconfesional el fondo de la cuesti n es que en un estado laico no deber a haber ceremoniales religiosos de ning n tipo el gobierno no deber a organizar un funeral de estado ni amparar la sensaci n de que hay una religi n oficial
7830293 no tenemos una relaci n tan fluida con la moncloa como la puede tener la iglesia cat lica

7830319 politics and the judicial world are not supposed to mix and they obviously do
7830320 i do not believe we will have that kind of action by the state supreme court

7830343 cases like victor stanley okeefe and equity analytics demonstrate that while keyword searches are useful for coping with the dramatic rise in the volume of esi there are limitations with todays keyword search technologies
7830344 these shortcomings are addressed by clearwells transparent search which provides attorneys and litigation support professionals with the ability to test the efficacy of their keyword lists and refine their word selection in preparation for 26 f conferences this added level of insight dramatically reduces processing and review cost while bolstering defensibility to the new levels now being mandated by current case law
7830345 recent case law is driving a sea change in e discovery search and forcing enterprises and law firms to show their work in the courtroom
7830346 transparent search is the first technology that caters to the unique requirements of lawyers and litigation support professionals by enabling testing sampling and iterative refinement of keyword searches as a result legal teams can now devise more defensible search strategies better collaborate on keyword search terms and dramatically reduce false positives and irrelevant documents prior to review

7830431 in france the matter is settled barack obama our idol the candidate of us all in the strange political unanimity that we secretly adhere to when we look beyond our borders will win triumphantly in november in fact we show almost no interest at all in john mccain that old white haired reactionary
7830432 remember the 2004 election and what was his name ah yes john kerry he made headlines in courrier international t l rama and nouvel observateur he was supposed to make us love a new america he spoke french too we even went as far as reviving politically and in the media his cousin brice lalonde to get him to tell us about his teenage vacations with him in brittany a whack in the face george w bush was triumphantly re elected no need to recount the votes from florida this time the republicans had thrashed the democratic party few people in france ever wondered why our desires and predictions were such a long way from american political reality
7830433 lets hope that in future we will look a little more lucidly at these realities we shouldnt be disappointed if a president obama isnt thinking about us while shaving in the white house let alone have a falling out with john mccain who may very well prevail

7830555 the uniqueness of global fund lies in its country ownership model implemented through country coordinating mechanisms ccms that are made up of representatives from government the private sector civil society and people living with the diseases
7830556 i believe this goes a long way in ensuring that requests for funding are tailored to address key areas of need as determined by each country in addition to the uniqueness of its country ownership model the fundamental principles of performance based funding also ensures that funds are continually channeled to successfully grant recipients who demonstrate measurable and effective results this allows grant recipients to also demonstrate their achievements clearly and make a case for more funding
7830557 the global fund has committed over 114m to fighting the three pandemics in ghana since its inception in 2002
7830558 these diseases affect business with loss of countless man hours and lives private sector organisations that partner with the global fund either through direct cash contributions or co investment should receive tax breaks and business incentives from their governments to encourage their participation

7830569 west ham united have absolutely no intention of selling craig bellamy
7830570 he is under contract and is committed to the club craig remains a very important part of our plans for the future

7830573 to give the party momentum going into the general election so that come november barack obama will become the president of the united states
7830574 now in a first for me im supporting a republican john mccain i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment
7830575 im here to tell you my name is hillary clinton and i do not support this message
7830576 if he wants to win the election he needs to get the vast majority of hillary supporters her strongest support is where hes weakest white working class men and women
7830577 absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and bill clinton understand the stakes senator clinton has pledged wholehearted support to my campaign as has president clinton
7830578 they have to make those voters comfortable with barack obama have to make them think hes part of the american dream
7830579 there is no stronger surrogate for senator obama among senator clintons supporters than senator clinton
7830580 so we are confident as we come through this convention that our party will come together it might take a little time for some people to come around but we cant let the few voices distort the vast majority of her supporters that i do believe support senator obama

7830634 federal law enforcement is working hand in glove with the aurora police department because this matter is currently under investigation there is little we can say right now

7830637 but then at a point you get angry and you start questioning well why did this take so long why did it take so long to be notified
7830638 why didnt they do something in that three hours rather than having my son locked in with this maniac who there was no question had done this and they allowed him to defile my sons body in the way that he did what was their game plan why did they wait for him to throw himself out a window or fall out of it
7830639 they have a preservation of life policy i believe there was no preserving my sons life at this point i knew that but to allow what went on for three hours to continue when they could see and knew what he was doing in there and they did nothing to stop it
7830640 its why i cant sleep its the visions that keep coming into my head and i dont know when ill ever get rid of those

7830643 the tragic shooting of the toddler highlights once again the terrible consequences of the boys toys culture surrounding airgun ownership
7830644 this culture results in easy access casual regard and non accountability because airguns are not treated as real weapons they are not thought worthy of registration or regulation
7830645 they are not taken seriously the adults who own these guns are rarely held to account there is no law requiring them to store their weapons safely nor is there any record of ownership
7830646 the government cannot hide behind recent changes in legislation which failed to take the airgun problem seriously enough and make owners responsible for storing their weapons safely
7830647 airguns and their owners could be registered and they should be

7830662 with the economic situation worsening and the property market still suffering we are calling on the government to take urgent action on hips
7830663 we have long seen hips as not fit for purpose and as the wrong answer to simplifying the house buying process
7830664 first time buyers are also receiving the information in the hip for free helping to reduce costs for households looking to get on to the property ladder
7830665 have you ever had an acute febrile illness consistent with a possible diagnosis of chikv fever between february 1 2005 and the date of the interview
7830666 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7830667 i think its fair to say there was muffled consternation in the first few seconds
7830668 people were clearly suffering with the shock of it but on the whole people had a stiff upper lip about it and they were resigned to their fate they were properly terrified
7830669 they thought they were going to meet their maker and thats not an exaggeration
7830670 americans recognize that neither john mccain nor barack obama are agents of change in this country
7830671 senators mccain and obama are the remnants of a political establishment that has failed the american people and will continue to do so as long as voters give them a chance its time to send them a message a message that says we will not tolerate another four years of business as usual in washington
7830672 liberals who are tired of the democratic party acting as a doormat to the governments assault against civil liberties
7830673 and conservatives who are tired of the republican partys reckless abandonment of fiscal responsibility are all potential barr voters as more voters realize that neither obama nor mccain are candidates truly dedicated to reversing these trends you can expect to see my numbers climb steadily higher
7830674 cynthia mckinney deserves a place in the new orleans debate any presidential candidate who has qualified for enough ballot lines to achieve the necessary electoral votes to win to be elected regardless of poll numbers has earned a place in the debates the 15 threshold is being used to exclude all candidates outside of the corporate party nominees john mccain and barack obama
7830675 ms mckinney is more than just the candidate of a viable and growing party she has played a special role in the movement to help survivors of the 2005 hurricane disaster in new orleans and the gulf coast region no other presidential candidate can talk about the needs of those whove been displaced or otherwise affected by katrina the way ms mckinney can their concerns will be missing from the debate if cynthia mckinney isnt invited
7830676 voters deserve to know about all the names theyll see on the ballot on election day and to know which candidate best represents ones interests and ideals its time to end debates limited to candidates approved by sponsoring corporations and pollsters
7830677 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

7830680 it has been fully established that between august 7 and 12 georgias armed forces invaded the territory of the unrecognised republic with the aim of fully annihilating the ossetian ethnic group living in south ossetia
7830681 they spared no one we found a woman who had been killed with a shot to the head she was eight months pregnant her unborn child died too
7830682 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7830683 how dangerous such so called frozen conflicts can be given that the georgian leadership as they say went crazy
7830684 were reviewing our entire relationship with russia both for the medium term and the long term
7830685 no question that russia has not lived up to the ceasefire agreement
7830686 the status of those two regions in georgia are not a matter for any one country to decide theyre a matter for the international community through the mechanisms at the united nations

7830718 i dont look much like barack obama and we grew up in different places but im here tonight because ive met barack and he understands what people like my wife and i are going through
7830719 it was like talking with family it became clear that they are regular people
7830720 barack and michelle grew up dealing with the same challenges most of us face they were raised by working folks and its pretty clear that he can relate to working people and those who are struggling
7830721 obama tells you what we need to hear like john mccains gas tax proposal isnt the answer barack obama has been willing to speak the truth that it is just designed to win elections not fix our problems
7830722 barack obama is the only person i trust to do the right thing for all of us thats why im here tonight and thats why hes my choice for president
7830723 he was well spoken he got the facts he wanted to speak out
7830724 we have a chance to get peyton activated and out to practice so well see how that goes
7830725 we have not been a three quarterback team since ive been here but i would think especially early in the season we would be
7830726 a lot of that depends on the medical report on jim

7830732 west ham united have absolutely no intention of selling craig bellamy
7830733 he is under contract and is committed to the club craig remains a very important part of our plans for the future
7830734 the club is being run on sound football and business principles in order to develop a squad which can deliver success this season no player would be bought or sold unless that helped to achieve that aim
7830735 we are not interested in selling players who are committed to the club and essential to our first team squad
7830736 if a player refuses to sign a new contract or is not crucial to the managers plans then we will look at offers on a case by case basis it is the only sensible way to build for the future
7830737 we have invested in players this summer identified by the manager who add to the quality of the squad and we will continue to do so as and when appropriate
7830738 ora che mi sento bene spengo la luce sxo di riuscire a dimostrare che cos va bene ora che ci penso mi perdo in quellattimo in cui dicevo che tutto era fantastico mi sembra ieri ed ora che successo fa lo stesso

7830741 we are putting in place an integrated national knowledge network that would have nodes to all major institutions of higher education and learning
7830742 this network would help our institutions of higher learning to connect with each other and carry on the relevant interdisciplinary dialogue
7830743 collaboration and co creation are becoming the hallmark of higher education today in an increasingly democratizing and globalised world
7830744 academic resources can then flow from institutions like iits iims national research institutions and universities into each other enriching every participating institution
7830745 the first phase of the network will become functional before the end of this year and this iit at guwahati will be part of it
7830746 we have tried to address the uneven geographical spread of higher education facilities in this phase of rapid expansion the northeast and in particular assam has received its due share of such institutions

7830760 i dont think we need to beg countries to play against especially during ramadan i mean we have international cricket coming up later this year and then there is the series against india early next year
7830761 in any case we would only be preferring player to represent the national team who are fully committed to the teams cause
7830762 it was probably the worst one day international we have played in two years england certainly played well but we were more disappointed in our performance weve got to improve in all departments england probably scored 25 runs too many and from a batting point of view we lost wickets at key moments
7830763 and certainly we werent up to standard in the field there is a lot of work to be done in all three departments weve had a couple of days now to get out practice and chat about it hopefully we can come out and turn the tables

7830777 tuatara says august 26th 2008 at 4 21 pm oh and phil you cant make significant policy with six mps
7830778 i think the thing that may have clinched it was the last minute concession from government to promulgate a national policy statement
7830779 a great indicator that the greens did the right thing is that you all are so upset
7830780 it has the teeth needed to keep councils from allowing the destruction of biodiversity
7830781 this is sorta like passing a bill ostensibly to end slavery that does nothing about ending slavery and just ends up insulating their slave quarters

7830783 decried for making a position that didnt give right wing hacks the fight they wanted

7830786 this new contract clause which currently applies to british farmer milk suppliers to tesco uk is the thin end of the wedge
7830787 icsa is deeply concerned that this clause must be opposed before it becomes the norm for all suppliers of farm produce to tesco not just in the uk but in ireland as well
7830788 i want to send a very clear signal to tesco and other retailers that irish farmers will not wear any such demands it is absolutely unacceptable that tesco should demand the disclosure of detailed information on costs and profitability from a farmers accounts to any third party agency
7830789 the clear implication is that tesco is looking for justification to squeeze farmer margins even more such information is a private matter for farm families and is commercially sensitive
7830790 i dont see tesco offering open and transparent information on how much margin they are making on farm products such as milk beef or lamb

7830794 if you polled the average guy on the street who knew anything about buyouts theyd say oh my gosh bell is going to stop investing the neat thing about this announcement is that thats absolutely not the case
7830795 were investing with discipline in growing markets and where we know we can win competitively
7830796 my personal view is that a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in this is very much a personal view at this stage

7830799 police will use all means to restore normalcy as soon as possible
7830800 police will take decisive action against the protesters government restraint is almost over
7830801 i ask all the protesters who have been blockading or occupying government offices that you still have a chance to withdraw and go back to your homes
7830802 i will not resign i will stay to protect this country
7830803 the military will not allow the protesters to take control of the country however it is not the time yet for military force
7830804 the easiest way to restore normalcy is for prime minister samak to quit
7830805 if we do not receive a clear and positive response we will prolong the rally to the next day and mobilise more protesters
7830806 the military will not stage a coup detat the public must not panic and must carry on their daily lives the army will not get involved in politics
7830807 this would be a big step up for nice but people ive spoken to have heard rawlins making these kind of comments in private before
7830808 nice was not created to set medicine prices nor indeed to drive them down as nices chairman now seems to see as his mission
7830809 forecast sales and the effect on the nhs drugs bill and
7830810 nice is beginning to flex its muscles there will be regulation on prices nice will be involved in it and prices will go down
7830811 theyre the people who are probably best placed to say how much the drugs should cost
7830812 if nice gets involved in pricing as soon a drug is launched then at least the company will be able to start selling the product straight away if a price is agreed
7830813 nices role critical for the nhs is to value medicines but the recent decisions on kidney cancer confirm that we need to re examine how they define value we need less soulless arithmetic and more clinical judgment

7830838 migrant workers can bring enormous benefits to local businesses and areas
7830839 however many of these contributions such as new ideas and ways of working and an entrepreneurial spirit may have been neglected in the past
7830840 to get the most out of migration local communities alongside local leaders businesses universities and central government need to recognise the variety of benefits that migrants can bring and plan accordingly
7830841 our population is increasing by a third of a million every year mainly due to immigration we will have to build the equivalent of the city of birmingham every three years just to cope with this
7830842 the public are rightly deeply opposed to the present massive levels of immigration without encouraging yet more
7830843 while the government cannot comment in detail given that the report is not yet published we recognise that migrants make an important contribution to the economy
7830844 the governments approach is to both maximise the benefits that migrants bring and to mitigate any transitional local impacts and that is why the communities secretary launched the migration impacts plan earlier this year
7830845 in addition the migration impacts forum chaired jointly by communities and home office regularly brings together government departments local authorities and others to look at evidence of local impact of migration and to spread good practice
7830846 we believe weve identified to our satisfaction all the people who were at the address no one is unaccounted for

7830958 the u s is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in north korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq
7830959 visits to facilities review of documents interviews with technical personnel and other measures unanimously agreed upon among the six parties
7830960 the u s however raised all of a sudden an issue of applying an international standard to the verification of the nuclear declaration abusing this agreed point
7830961 it pressured north korea to accept such inspection as scouring any place as it pleases to collect samples and measure them
7830962 the measure is regrettable as it came at a time when the six parties have to make concerted efforts to complete phase two of the denuclearization process

7830970 previously addiction to benzodiazepines has been explained by reference to negative rather than positive reinforcement in other words the thinking has been that the reason people continue to use the medicine is that it helps to alleviate their distressing withdrawal symptoms and general discomfort rather than because it provides a sense of reward
7830971 our studies have shown that diazepam also affects the dopamine system which adds a new positive reinforcement mechanism of reward learning to the theory of benzodiazepine addiction

7830981 i think the winning the race part has sunk in as a cyclist you think afterwards tactically what i did was it right and what could i have done better
7830982 but i dont think being an olympic champion has sunk in yet
7830983 i think all of us would agree that was a phenomenal olympic games im sure when we all got on to the plane to go to beijing we had incredibly high expectations of what beijing would deliver and i think they did that they did more than that

7831008 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7831009 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7831010 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7831011 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest

7831025 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7831026 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7831027 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7831028 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7831029 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7831030 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7831031 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7831032 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7831033 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7831034 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7831035 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7831036 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7831037 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7831038 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7831039 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7831040 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
7831041 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
7831042 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
7831043 no one works for someone we all just work together
7831044 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
7831045 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7831046 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7831047 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
7831048 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
7831049 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
7831050 a recent article i did had me asking the question

7831053 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7831054 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7831055 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7831056 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7831057 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7831058 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7831059 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers

7831085 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7831086 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7831087 id heard it from a pretty good source last night but everyone was thrilled to hear about it at our breakfast this is the kind of moment that sen kennedy lives for
7831088 id heard something over the weekend but his health is such an issue it wasnt clear if hed be able to come
7831089 im a cancer survivor and i know how draining this kind of thing can be
7831090 it pushes the focus back on the challenge ahead and on obama and the race it gives people something positive to talk about
7831091 this may be ted kennedys final gift to the party
7831092 this says that he feels this is the democrats year and the party is not as unified as hed like it to be his appearance takes the headlines away from the clinton faction
7831093 happens to be somebody who i love to death hes just a good man and obviously hes going through a difficult time but im glad that we can use this convention to remind people of the contributions hes made to this country
7831094 just charges the atmosphere here the emotion is enormous its just what you want to start off the convention
7831095 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
7831096 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
7831097 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
7831098 it is all too easy to find the 100 women who will protest at the convention and they become the story
7831099 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
7831100 people dont know yet that john mccain is just bad for women
7831101 talking about these differences is clearly a pathway to generating intensity among women voters
7831102 these swing women voters have tremendous economic anxiety right now
7831103 women are going to the watercooler and talking about what just happened in georgia
7831104 they are not unmindful of the way the world impacts on them
7831105 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
7831106 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
7831107 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
7831108 are a bad reflection on him as a human being
7831109 real world management strategies as opposed to the crap you tell your staff
7831110 im a property owner we own a lot of property but we live in one or two
7831111 taking into consideration the free expression of will of the ossetians and abkhazians i signed an order recognizing independence of south ossetia and abkhazia
7831112 our country became mediator and peacekeeper but we proceeded from the recognition of the territorial integrity of georgia
7831113 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
7831114 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
7831115 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
7831116 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
7831117 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
7831118 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
7831119 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
7831120 yes we were happily the middle aged metal masters left their skin tight spandex pants at home flying v guitars bouffant hair and cheesy anthems they looked more like psychotic barbie dolls than hard lovin macho rockers trying to be cool we turned to
7831121 if you stick around long enough people tend to re discover you
7831122 i remember about six or seven years ago i was at a mall and i must have seen about 20 kids with m tley cr es t shirts on and it just kind of reinvents itself
7831123 weve set out to be together since day one theres a lot of bands that have been together for three four five years and theyve done their run were one of the kind of bands that keep going and changing and keeping up with the times like the
7831124 mick just said i want to hear a lot of guitars and i want to hear snotty lyrics
7831125 and i was like exactly where im coming from dude i dont want loops and samples and beats you know i dont want to be nine inch nails i dont want to be
7831126 that will bring fans closer to one of historys greatest rock bands
7831127 russia caused serious damage to georgia russia troops blew up the poti port and ships in the black sea as a result huge volume of fuel runs out the sea causing pollution
7831128 you have to differentiate your music in todays industry and how you introduce things to your audience this is the direction for the future of the way fans connect with artists it also adds another dimension to our live performance by getting the fans involved from the moment they walk though the door literally
7831129 its a cool generational thing to share that with your kids
7831130 my sons favorite bands are the same bands that are my favorite bands the bands i grew up on
7831131 the same speech hes been giving for months why didnt he give the germans something more
7831132 it was a tent in the desert 100 degree heat off and on for what seemed like forever
7831133 why was i held by the united states like that when i was their ally
7831134 if theyre exaggerating and distorting this much in august what will october be like
7831135 oftentimes one brings in celebrity for a sense of making a campaign look like its young and vibrant and visionary and all the rest of it you give it a bit of that showbiz juice the problem is that the last thing that barack obama needs is showbiz juice
7831136 hes got all the charisma hes got the speaking the whole idea of this rock star candidate is now to some extent being reframed to become a liability the democratic party has to be really careful that they dont paint themselves as a hollywood presidency kind of thing
7831137 a lot of people are beginning to realize that celebrity endorsements are doing a lot more to get you to change your mind about the celebrity than they do to get you to change your mind about a candidate
7831138 most people come to candidates with pretty set ideas of what their party is and who they like and who they dont
7831139 just because one of their favourite actors endorses someone or speaks for one of them i think its more likely that the average voter is going to say oh i used to like that celebrity but they like candidate x so i dont like that celebrity anymore
7831140 if the youth vote turns out as it did with the primaries for obama i think youre going to see a president obama
7831141 if the youth vote does as it has done in the past and that is that it always promises and looks like its going to be behind john kerry or al gore then what youre going to see is president mccain
7831142 i think it cuts both ways the candidates want celebrities there because it brings media attention but they dont want them around too much because they dont want to bring negative attention as though it is just a celebrity kind of endorsement
7831143 depending on the celebrity you might be able to register three votes but you might lose three votes there are people in hollywood who are very divisive in terms of their politics
7831144 the celebrities use it as a means of getting themselves back into the limelight
7831145 its what i would call a synergistic relationship where both sides probably benefit in a celebrity spectacle culture
7831146 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
7831147 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance
7831148 in the process of expanding in europe germany is one of several possible future markets
7831149 we receive inquiries from all over the world there is enormous interest in current
7831150 according to our observations germany is a market that could soon be ripe for current
7831151 tv and the web amount to the same thing to us
7831152 unlike most broadcasters we do not only use television to attract people to the internet on the contrary people go to current com swap thoughts concerns and videos and then we bring the best of it to the tv screen
7831153 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
7831154 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
7831155 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
7831156 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
7831157 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
7831158 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
7831159 ringrazio lui e zanetti per avermi dedicato la supercoppa adesso auguro loro unaltra stagione ricca di successi
7831160 this is not going to be the year that we make big changes
7831161 inclusive candidate who understands that our party needs to reach out to all americans to win this election
7831162 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7831163 its a disappointing and vulgar attack on john mccain who has devoted his life to the cause of freedom and the fight against tyranny
7831164 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
7831165 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
7831166 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
7831167 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
7831168 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
7831169 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
7831170 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
7831171 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
7831172 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
7831173 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
7831174 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
7831175 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
7831176 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
7831177 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
7831178 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
7831179 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off
7831180 what i notice about men all men is that their order is me my family god is in there somewhere but me is first
7831181 and for women me is fourth and thats not healthy
7831182 further integration and or assimilation into a white cultural and social structure that will only allow me to remain on the periphery of society never becoming a full participant
7831183 to make sure my kids have their heads on straight
7831184 her name wasnt even mentioned at our breakfast meeting this morning and half the people in the room were clinton delegates
7831185 apparently weve moved past racism in america but we havent moved past sexism
7831186 i am hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7831187 the fact is that our teams are working closely to ensure a successful convention
7831188 anyone saying anything else doesnt know what theyre talking about period
7831189 by rule as a delegate i must support the nominee im going to follow the rule
7831190 i wont get to cast my vote my state wont reflect what the vote was that would be very unfortunate if you are going to disenfranchise half of the people at the convention its going to be very hard to find unity
7831191 the largest portion of it is media spin and groups that have no association with her campaign
7831192 theyre groups that are more into making a statement about themselves rather than about the democratic party or senator clinton
7831193 were going to see a rousing speech from her she can give such a great speech its going to bring the convention together and its going to be a united convention
7831194 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
7831195 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
7831196 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
7831197 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
7831198 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
7831199 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
7831200 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
7831201 the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush
7831202 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7831203 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
7831204 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
7831205 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
7831206 environmentalists can have a sense of humour too environmentalists can have a sense of humour too
7831207 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7831208 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7831209 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7831210 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7831211 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7831212 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
7831213 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
7831214 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
7831215 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7831216 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7831217 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7831218 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7831219 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7831220 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7831221 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7831222 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7831223 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7831224 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7831225 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7831226 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7831227 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7831228 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7831229 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7831230 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7831231 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7831232 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7831233 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7831234 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7831235 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7831236 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7831237 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7831238 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7831239 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7831240 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7831241 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7831242 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7831243 this is a planning took where all things are going

7831264 anda tahu sangat jarang bisa bertemu dengan bintang nba dan ini merupakan kesempatan langka bagi mereka granger telah bersedia memberikan waktunya di sini dengan ini saya harap mereka bisa termotivasi untuk mengejar sesuatu mereka bisa menjadi pebasket seniman ilmuwan atau apapun yang mereka mau
7831265 ini merupakan kesempatan yang langka ya bagi anak anak yang anak laki laki sangat antusias cuma kok yang perempuan rada malu malu ya
7831266 my only interest was to establish the truth im happy that the court has made its declaration of falsity and that the authors and publishers have recognised their falsehoods and apologised as far as i am concerned thats the end of the matter
7831267 giving back 400 acres is dropping the project i cannot afford to do that
7831268 we will start a state wide agitation now against the project unless the land is returned to the farmers

7831270 i hope the car will come out of the plant in october
7831271 more pain is also expected in the u s housing market with investors still waiting for the bottom
7831272 poor growth figures from the imf is a another dose of realism for europe the eurozone lags the u s and the uk and this is more evidence that there has been too much overspending and it is likely merkel and
7831273 axon is a global leader in its field we believe there is room for a counter bid closer to 700 pence a share
7831274 we regard morse as the most likely company to benefit from the read through from the axon bid with its diagonal sap consultancy being the most obvious attraction
7831275 there are about 20 companies worldwide who are working in our market who could possibly bid but the infosys offer is the only one on the table and the one the management are backing
7831276 six hundred pence is still a 33 percent premium to the average price of the stock over the past six months and its in cash

7831279 if i could somehow snap my fingers and cut off the funding from one country it would be saudi arabia
7831280 a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and allahs religion is made victorious over all other religions

7831290 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
7831291 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
7831292 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
7831293 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
7831294 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
7831295 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
7831296 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
7831297 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
7831298 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
7831299 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter

7831318 this decision comes after every possible attempt was made by us to try and find a solution the local promoters defaulted making it impossible to progress forward we are truly saddened for those fans who purchased tickets in rotterdam and oberhausen in anticipation of experiencing this extravaganza we are certain that we will be touring the european region and we will come back to embrace more cities soon

7831333 i am unable to understand its kbc star televisions show kaun banega crorepati based on who ant to be a millionaire falling interest as the graphs show despite he fact that they were presented by bigger and more popular stars namely shah rukh and now to see panchvi pass or as one rival channel executive sniggered panchvi fail after its not too encouraging numbers facing relative lower ratings is what i wish to debate on and would love to have inputs from readers
7831334 when the show lost its actual host it lost its glamour as well and mr bachchan shah rukh khan is the king but you still are the emperor
7831335 this is a great news source which i look forward to reading every day
7831336 whilst thousands of people came to join in with the fun and spectacle of carnival once again the event ended with a small minority of people determined to fight and cause trouble
7831337 for over two hours our officers were faced with a hardcore mainly of young men who came to carnival not to enjoy the event but to fight commit crime and cause trouble
7831338 officers had to work hard and deliver a strong interventionist style of policing late into the night to make sure that these criminals were not allowed to take over the streets of notting hill
7831339 this is not the way anyone can want to see the carnival finish
7831340 through our stop and search use of screening wands and seizures of dangerous dogs we sent a clear message that carnival is no place for such behaviour as this
7831341 a fast time intelligence led operation in oval managed to stop a large group we believed were headed for the carnival to commit such scenes of disorder
7831342 no one wants to see this unique event being overshadowed by such unacceptable behaviour
7831343 as a former resident of ladbroke grove i have watched the notting hill carnival go from strength to strength each year to become an internationally acclaimed event
7831344 nothing beats the sounds of the steel pans the aroma of delicious caribbean food and the dazzling colours of the costume parade
7831345 the carnival is the perfect london spectacle to captivate the world with its dazzling array of costumes and music
7831346 this years event was enjoyed by more than a million people as the sights and sounds of the caribbean and other cultures came alive on the streets
7831347 ive been very impressed its been lively and colourful and people are really enjoying themselves
7831348 the number of arrests is up on last year but that is predominantly because of proactive policing
7831349 the message is that there is no place for knives at the carnival
7831350 we share the concern of londoners over the recent spate of knife crime and we are doing all we can to combat that
7831351 more than a million people had a great time at the notting hill carnival and enjoyed an amazing spectacle of colour energy and music
7831352 the bank holiday weekend was the culmination of a series of successful carnival events during the month of august
7831353 while this incident which happened after the festivities were over and people were on their way home is extremely disappointing it is important that it should not overshadow what is europes greatest street party
7831354 we will be working with the police to look at exactly what happened and to prevent incidents like this happening in the future

7831356 the vaticans decision to move cardinal newmans body from its resting place is an act of grave robbbery and religious desecration it violates newmans repeated wish to be buried for eternity with his life long partner ambrose st john
7831357 they have been together for more than 100 years and the vatican wants to disturb that peace to cover up the fact that newman loved a man its a shameful dishonourable betrayal of newman by the gay hating catholic church
7831358 i dont think anyone disputes thatcardinal newman deeply loved ambrose st john he did say after st john died that the grief is comparable to a husband losing a wife or a wife losing a husband but he did not mean that the relationship with ambrose st john was a marriage like a gay relationship it is simply wrong to read back from todays categories into the victorian periods when these very intense passionale but totally celibate relationships in oxford and among the anglocatholic community were very common italics mine
7831359 to love another whether of the same sex or of a different sex is to have entered the area of the richest human experience
7831360 the consumer climate was depressed further by the very subdued economic outlook even significantly lower crude oil prices did nothing to brighten the consumer mood
7831361 consumers are not interpreting the marked decrease in crude oil prices as an all clear signal when it comes to purchasing power
7831362 the german economy is encountering an increasingly more difficult situation
7831363 the german consumer is clearly no match for the rapid slowdown of the global economy
7831364 high energy prices are reducing the purchasing power of consumers with manufacturing and wholesale prices rocketing most recently there is little hope of an easing in the price trend of other fast moving consumer goods
7831365 real disposable income for consumption will therefore hardly see an increase this year

7831393 burnham scientists are clearly among the elite in the world of stem cell biology and we are excited to be working closely with them to exploit leaps capabilities to improve their potential in working with stem cells

7831412 conversations about planning for the unexpected arent necessarily easy but they are conversations that every family needs to have
7831413 many households either have no life insurance or do not have enough life insurance to help cope if faced with the unexpected the state farm embrace life awards program is a wonderful reminder about the importance of planning today to protect our families futures
7831414 were too young to worry about life insurance thats for old people
7831415 never think a terminal illness or sudden death happens to other people and would never happen to your family
7831416 death can come in different manners and at any age it is imperative to protect families financially with life insurance
7831417 be open to hope and to be open to help pride can get in the way but everyone going through this no matter who they are needs help financial or otherwise
7831418 if people think they cant afford life insurance they should look and see if theres something in their lives they can live without or can spend less on

7831430 of current concern to the college administration is the apparent drop in the enrolment figures over the last two years
7831431 in order to meet the numbers the college has dropped the requirement for interviews for prospective students
7831432 the sudden reversal in the quest for education and training is something that has to be looked at urgently otherwise colleges will become white elephants
7831433 we continue to lose teachers at an alarming rate but the government continues to turn a blind eye to the crisis
7831434 and this has also resulted in most people shying away from joining the education sector because of low salaries forcing colleges to relax entry requirements thereby compromising standards

7831441 there was no price relief in our key input costs in the fourth quarter
7831442 in fact just the opposite occurred with july corn futures reaching all time highs of over 7 50 per bushel in late june and may wheat futures reaching nearly 9 00 per bushel this directly impacted our reported results for the fourth quarter and even to a greater extent than we witnessed in the third quarter
7831443 fortunately natural gas prices have retreated to around 8 00 per million btus from a recent high of nearly 13 00 per million btus
7831444 while we expect to benefit from these lower energy costs in coming quarters we are continuing to pursue plans for the installation of a coal boiler cogeneration facility at our pekin il plant which has the potential to generate significant energy savings starting in 2011 if all goes as anticipated
7831445 the major impact on our results for all of fiscal 2008 was from commodity inflation namely the record high prices for corn and wheat combined with the hike in natural gas prices corn and wheat prices for the year averaged 37 6 percent and 63 3 percent higher respectively above our fiscal 2007 levels while the price of natural gas averaged 14 8 percent higher than the average price of natural gas during the prior year the substantial rise in natural gas prices occurred as oil prices exceeded over 140 per barrel for a time during the latter part of fiscal 2008 recently oil prices have declined to a range of approximately 115 to 120 per barrel and as a result natural gas prices have also trended down
7831446 as we previously stated we are transforming mgpi into a leading u s producer of specialty proteins and starches as well as high quality food grade alcohol this has been no small feat as we completely reconfigured our ingredient technology platforms around our customers we narrowed our product lines to drive to a higher value mix we also took the opportunity to rationalize our manufacturing footprint which as previously reported involved the write down of plant and equipment associated with the manufacturing of pet related products and certain of our wheatex r textured wheat proteins that in the future we plan to produce through third parties these actions in total are geared to improving our long term profits and cash flows at the same time the structural and business process changes have created a strong foundation for enabling new growth opportunities in our respective business segments
7831447 although they could have terminated our ability to borrow or accelerated our debt they have elected not to do so at this time and have continued to honor our draws under the credit facility they are working with us to develop our new credit terms
7831448 although they have proposed to eliminate our unused term facility and reduce the length of our revolving line of credit facility to a year at most and tighten other credit arrangements in certain respects they have told us that they will be increasing our revolving line of credit to 55 million we are discussing a definitive agreement with them and expect to enter one in the next few days under their latest proposal we would be restricted from paying dividends and there will be a 60 day standstill period during which time they could review our commodity positions and hedging strategy and measure our performance under new forbearance period financial covenants that would set minimum adjusted ebitda and tangible net worth requirements after the standstill period the banks can decide whether and how they want to proceed
7831449 starting with our gross margins we would anticipate improvements if market prices for corn and wheat decline and natural gas prices remain near or below current levels
7831450 if i had to pick one thing to point to this past year as tangible progress around our long term strategy it would be strengthened sales of the right mix of specialty ingredients
7831451 although our customer list is relatively small in number each one is very large in size and broad in scope
7831452 in our distillery products segment pending acceptable fuel alcohol margins our manufacturing volumes should start to build after the current quarter following planned downtime for maintenance and process improvement efforts mgpi has an estimated annual capacity of approximately 130 million gallons of alcohol as we work our way back to full production rates we have the opportunity to better maximize our current capacity which would translate into volume increases approaching 16 percent over the fiscal 2008 level much of the volume will be focused on our food grade alcohol where we remain a key supplier of high quality products our industry reach is wide from vinegar to flavorings and extracts to cleaning solutions to pharmaceuticals to personal care products similar to our ingredients business our future potential lies in capturing a greater share from a relatively small number of multi billion dollar global corporations the fuel grade alcohol area represents only approximately 30 percent of our total company revenues we would expect this percentage to decrease over time as we grow our specialty ingredients and food grade alcohol revenues as with all of our distillery operations our goal in the fuel grade alcohol arena is to optimize the profit margin from corn
7831453 theres no getting around the fact that this was a difficult year for mgpi with a strengthened management team and a more efficient configuration of assets we expect to see measurable results on the bottom line as we execute our plans for growth

7831460 the executive mansion is gravely concerned over recently unearthed email exchanges allegedly bearing the addresses of individuals purportedly discussing business deals involving governments pending negotiations with the liberian maritime registry liscr
7831461 and of grave magnitude is the linkage the purported email exchanges attempt to draw between the office of the president and the deals allegedly being discussed
7831462 the executive mansion and hereby wishes to establish a clear line of demarcation between the office of the president and the allegations in the purported email exchanges the executive mansion weekend statement said
7831463 the president of the republic is determined to ensure that every contract entered into between this government and any other entity will have only one objective and that is that such contracts serve the welfare and the benefit of the people of this nation
7831464 since her incumbency president ellen johnson sirleaf has made it a duty to review every contract signed between the government of liberia and other partners be it national or international to ensure that the people of liberia reap the benefit of their nations natural resources
7831465 the government believes this action to be necessary so that the agreement is in no way perceived as being tainted
7831466 in a similar vein the government wishes to state that if the results of the investigations show that this was part of a scheme that the emails were doctored and that they were initiated by persons seeking to defame the government and impeded the development strides it is making appropriate legal and other actions will be vigorously taken against them
7831467 firstly because it impugns the integrity of the government secondly because it seeks to forge a wedge against the current efforts to restore liberias international image and secure investments to improve the lives of its citizenry and thirdly because it distracts from thegovernments current committed drives against corruption economic mismanagement and impunity all being adverse verses the government met when it assumed office
7831468 the matter is therefore not merely one of a local nature but has international implications
7831469 firstly the government has determined that immediate probes will be mounted by the appropriate security and legal institutions to determine the source of the emails the authenticity of the exchanges and the possible breaches of laws involved and those who have committed the breaches
7831470 in addition to the interviews which will be conducted of the parties the investigative agencies will be fully vested with the authority to solicit from the persons amongst whom the emails were supposedly exchanged to agree to have their emails opened for the periods in question including involvement by a team of designated international professional experts to determine whether in fact such exchanges emanated from their email boxes or addresses the possible venue where they may have occurred the timing of the occurrences
7831471 the government will expect that the persons who are alleged to have exchanged the emails will give their full cooperation and approval to the service provider to seek for and determine the source of the emails the government reserves the right to draw any appropriate conclusions relative to any persons who refuses permission for such probe to be made by the service provider
7831472 based on the recommendation of the minister of justice for maintaining the integrity and independence of the investigations the government has determined that further to any probes which are being carried out by the ministry of justice it will request the chief justice of the supreme court acting in consultation with the liberia national bar association to designate an honorable and highly respectable counselor of the liberian national bar association preferably a former justice of the supreme court of liberia to act as an independent special prosecutor to investigate the legal components of the allegations and make recommendations on the necessary actions to be taken by the government of liberia
7831473 emails tie liberian officials to liscr deal bribery u s help sought in probe
7831474 obtained a chain of emails that appears to suggest corruption at the highest level of the liberian government a bridge of liberias penal code and the united states anti bribery provisions of the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa
7831475 when we talk about war were really talkin about peace
7831476 the roster service is able to operate without legal interference because we do not associate our file with any logos or other type of insignia
7831477 what we do is similar to somebody doing the legwork on a very detailed depth chart for all the fbs teams and then selling this data file to a college football preseason magazine we only sell a data file which is why it works
7831478 ea put this feature into the game knowing this was going to happen
7831479 and even though they say they do not condone making accurate rosters this is why many people purchase this game as they can become familiar with the big stars in college football this year

7831481 there was a retailer in one of the countries that sold their systems with linux

7831483 it was very difficult to find venture capital to use it to develop new companies this has been changing
7831484 venture capitalists are starting to come not only from outside brazil to brazil but even inside brazil there have been groups forming
7831485 they are new for brazil and they are designed in brazil

7831517 i come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to its best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7831518 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight and i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate when we begin to write the next great chapter of american progress
7831519 the torch will be passed again to a generation of americans
7831520 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7831521 i think hes a terrific pick because i think he is qualified
7831522 he knows his stuff he knows what he is doing and he is a good politician he is going to be terrific
7831523 and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7831524 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7831525 people like joe biden whos never forgotten where he came from and never stopped fighting for folks who work long hours and face long odds and need someone on their side again
7831526 all of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do
7831527 that is why i love this country and in my own life in my own small way ive tried to give back to this country that has given me so much

7831535 we are pleased by the pending merger of campofrio and groupe smithfield the merger clearly creates a european packaged meats powerhouse with the number one share in many major markets
7831536 this merger also monetizes our investment in the groupe smithfield joint venture into a 37 percent share in a publicly traded company with 3 billion in sales
7831537 given the overall adverse environment of the industry i am pleased with the results for the current quarter
7831538 our fresh pork operations and our packaged meats business performed well in the face of sharply rising input costs we are continuing to focus closely on our cost structure and improving plant operating efficiencies also our new management structure is in place and moving forward nicely
7831539 we continue to be challenged by high input costs across all the businesses certainly a portion of this increase is the result of the current ethanol policy in place
7831540 the current government mandate puts the company in a position of having to compete with foreign oil for feed for our livestock this mandate has resulted in more than 30 percent of the corn crop being diverted from animal feed to ethanol production resulting in a sharp run up in corn prices tied to world oil markets this is a dynamic this industry has never faced we believe this policy is flawed and needs to be revised if food cost inflation is to be brought under control
7831541 looking forward to the remainder of fiscal 2009 the future is uncertain even as hog prices recently have risen and grain markets have moderated somewhat the delayed impact of grain costs will result in continued elevated raising costs

7831550 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7831551 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7831552 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7831553 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7831554 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7831555 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7831556 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7831557 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7831558 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7831559 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7831560 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7831561 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7831562 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7831563 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7831564 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7831565 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7831566 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7831567 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7831568 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7831569 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7831570 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7831571 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7831572 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7831573 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7831574 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7831575 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7831576 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7831577 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7831578 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7831579 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7831580 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7831581 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7831582 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7831583 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7831584 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7831585 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7831586 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7831587 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7831588 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7831589 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7831590 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7831591 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7831592 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7831593 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7831594 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7831595 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7831596 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7831597 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7831598 nous avons t inform s par les autorit s de hong kong que m gadd s tait vu refuser lentr e hong kong et il est retourn bangkok

7831601 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7831602 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7831603 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7831604 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7831605 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7831606 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7831607 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7831608 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7831609 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7831610 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7831611 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7831612 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7831613 o mais importante a recupera o da dignidade da auto estima da pessoa muitos n o se d o conta de que n o muito agrad vel ser um adulto da altura de uma crian a e viver com a cabe a perto dos traseiros de outras pessoas em elevadores e locais movimentados
7831614 o minist rio da educa o espera que no tempo regimental a institui o informe o nome do novo dirigente de acordo com os princ pios da autonomia universit ria
7831615 o geraldo tamb m n o ajudou a acabar com as escolas de lata mas o prefeito e o governador hoje se entendem antes n o se entendiam
7831616 atrav s dessa parceria foi poss vel fazer um trabalho integrado com os fomentados que plantam eucalipto no sentido de dar um apoio e um subs dio para que eles tenham condi es de recuperar suas reas com esp cies nativas
7831617 o objetivo maior que a gente tenha essa qualidade ambiental na propriedade a gente v que a parceria fundamental sem essa parceria n o poder amos desenvolver uma floresta sustent vel
7831618 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7831619 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7831620 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7831621 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7831622 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7831623 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7831624 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7831625 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7831626 causa perplexidade a inusitada atividade das for as navais da otan que aumentam seu agrupamento na guas do mar negro

7831628 nosso comandante supremo o presidente russo dmitri medvedev n o declarou que colocamos fim coopera o ele simplesmente deu a entender que isso pode ocorrer

7831630 the thing about winter is it forces people inside to contend with themselves for a while
7831631 i think so i really cant deal with that right now
7831632 what happened whyd she leave do you still love her
7831633 this distraction thing with this new guy but it might be helpful to at least theorize about what youre numbing yourself against
7831634 por isso temos que valorizar as sabatinas com os indicados
7831635 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
7831636 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7831637 as i look ahead i am strengthened by family and friendship
7831638 so many of you have been with me in the happiest days and the hardest days
7831639 together we have known success and seen failure victory and defeat
7831640 for me this is a season of hope new hope and this is the cause of my life new hope that we will break the old gridlock
7831641 really it was just the smallest thing that he was selling and so i bought it because he was nice and then i thought you know john will really love this tattered seashell imprinted leather wallet
7831642 youre sittin here in this city thinkin about him while hes up there in chicago
7831643 look itll hurt but if its something you want to do itll be worth it is it something you want to do
7831644 i mean yeah im spending lots of time with him
7831645 i guess i just feel like whats the point then
7831646 the point is im biding my time like i know eventually i have to deal with the fact that j and i are probably over forever and that if i want to have a husband and a family that ill have to eventually start looking for a new relationship but right now i just dont want to but i dont want to be alone either it sounds sort of pathetic i know i guess its all i feel like i can do right now
7831647 i get it i just feel like i dont have that kind of time anymore
7831648 you just have to take small steps you just have to try different stupid little things until something clicks and you groove on it for a while and see what happens its not like you just start doing something and instantly feel fulfilled
7831649 lost and confused in almost every facet of my life
7831650 there are procedures in place and we will adhere to them the first step in that is to consider the referees report
7831651 everything going according to plan shell run in the leger rather than the park hill stakes on september 11
7831652 she always showed plenty but punctured a joint in the spring thats why she missed the spring
7831653 we had her entered for the irish oaks and the leger before she ran weve always thought a lot of her
7831654 theres no reason why she shouldnt improve with age shes a big filly tall and narrow a good looking filly
7831655 her form has been good but to have a chance in the leger shed have to improve again having said that paktai was disappointing at the weekend so it looks the race to go for
7831656 hes had a few little problems were giving him some time off the next couple of weeks will tell us a lot more
7831657 he ran a good race three lengths in front of the third even if john oxxs looks an exceptional colt
7831658 these people in rainbows end have the attention span of a butterfly
7831659 we can use these data to highlight the need for international agreements to protect this threatened species
7831660 en el d a de ayer el seleccionador nacional absoluto masculino a to garc a reneses comunic que haciendo uso de una de las cl usulas estipuladas en su contrato ha decidido desvincularse del mismo
7831661 muy contento por la oportunidad de dirigir a espa a en unos juegos ol mpicos
7831662 no quiero entrenar s lo dos meses al a o ahora mismo prefiero seguir en activo durante toda la temporada
7831663 a plena disposici n de la feb para colaborar con ella en el futuro
7831664 no s lo por el resultado sino sobre todo por el trato que he recibido y los medios que se han puesto a disposici n del equipo
7831665 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
7831666 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
7831667 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
7831668 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7831669 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7831670 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
7831671 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
7831672 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
7831673 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
7831674 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
7831675 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7831676 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7831677 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
7831678 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
7831679 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
7831680 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
7831681 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
7831682 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
7831683 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7831684 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7831685 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
7831686 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
7831687 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7831688 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair

7831696 that has inspired me for 2010 knowing its canadas chance to do the same take some serious pride in our countrys performance and get behind everyone like weve never done before as a nation
7831697 i have watched pretty much all of it anytime i am at home the tv is on even watched french cbc they show some events that we dont see much of on the english side
7831698 very inspired by ian millar after nine olympics or 10 considering the boycott finally an olympic medal talk about perserverance
7831699 revved up certainly i have had a little more energy these two weeks in training us older guys need all the help we can get
7831700 my tv is never really off during the olympics just muted sometimes and i am definitely lacking sleep from staying up too late watching its awesome to wake up and eat my breakfast to our athletes competing it totally inspires me to get my butt to the gym
7831701 i was actually jumping up and down in my apartment when simon whitfield made his huge comeback to win silver
7831702 recovering from an injury surgery starts to eat at you physically and mentally
7831703 despatie perseverance after a tough season and great mental toughness
7831704 i would have to go with jeannie longo ciprelli of france in cycling for my inspiration here
7831705 to see her here long after that still racing and not just to be a participant but to be here to perform was amazing she turns 50 on oct 31 this year and this is me 12 years later now 35 and having a lot of people constantly asking me if im retiring or if im still speed skating
7831706 im full on training harder than ever before more focused and now more inspired seeing longo ciprelli come in fourth in the time trial and missing a medal by 1 6 seconds that tells me what i already know that im definitely not too old at 35
7831707 i am training in argentina and as a result watching the games have been difficult there were so many great stories from our canadian olympians watching the olympics and our canadian team has energized me
7831708 gymnast kyle shewfelt is a champion who inspired me beyond sport kyle succeeded against such tremendous odds his dedication hard work and above all his positive attitude have set an incredible example
7831709 i cant wait to buy the box set of the olympics and watch it when i get home
7831710 i am watching the games as much as my own life and training schedule allow the most inspiring performance for me simon whitfield to watch him be so patient and tactical throughout his race was amazing and then to watch him get dropped coming into the stadium area was heart wrenching
7831711 from an athlete toiling in the off season doldrums it was fantastic to witness such a motivating effort thanks simon
7831712 i actually just got back from new zealand where i was skiing for the past 3 weeks for the past 10 days i have been watching the olympics every free moment i have
7831713 whether it was down in new zealand or back home in fernie the games have captivated my attention from the get go and they have drawn me into my journey for an olympic medal in 2010
7831714 the stories of these athletes are so real so genuine and so original that it inspires me to dream bigger and better i actually think that by watching these games it has really put me in the olympic spirit for 2010
7831715 it was so great in new zealand to come back from a day on the slopes plop myself on my bed or the couch and be captivated for hours by sport although not a lot of the canadian athletes performances were shown on new zealand television the ones that were made me proud
7831716 i remember cheering like a banshee with teammate larisa yurkiw when ryan cochrane the swimmer earned his bronze medal it was not only the canadian performances that touched me i was nearly brought to tears when the womens marathon winner entered the stadium to a crowd of 91 000 people how powerful is that
7831717 was i watching of course i seriously live and breathe sport so being able to turn my tv on at 6 a m in the morning and have live action is my tv dreams coming true
7831718 i watched at home before morning training and for the last half hour of the coverage during lunch
7831719 simon no question inspired me the most his will and determination was impressive ive also been reading his blog so his preparation impressed me and i had total confidence he would will himself to the finish after reading about all the work he did in his little preparation shed
7831720 i was also really impressed with the chinese gymnasts in the all around competition and their divers i thought home crowd might affect one or two of them but you could see that they were so well prepared that they absolutely embraced the chance to show it off
7831721 it gave me some motivation to make sure i am doing my tough tricks every day well so that when i am in the moment i know that its easy ive done it every day in training for the last two years
7831722 it also made me feel the need to buckle down i felt the olympic stress all the way here in canada through my tv screen a reminder of how quickly it comes is always nice especially when you have 538 days i love the countdown widget left to make sure you are completely ready
7831723 i have stepped outside of reality for 16 days as i am obsessed with the summer olympics it started with all of the olympic trials thank goodness for my pvr at home so i can stay updated on my own time
7831724 i have to admit i had a hard time finding anything out about our canadian athletes with olympic trials so i was caught up on the american drama heading into beijing
7831725 i was inspired every time i was witnessing an athlete put it all on the line
7831726 i cried watching mike brown finish fourth in the 200m breaststroke my heart broke when i saw him look up at the board after his race i could relate to his experience except things turned around for me in torino
7831727 ive been trying to learn as much as possible from all of the athletes in any sort of situation good or bad whenever i see someone passionate about what they do it gives me goosebumps and inspires me to want to be better not only at sport but as a person
7831728 the main disappointment is that the argentineans are great at soccer womens field hockey and not so strong at paddling wrestling and many of the other sports canadians excel at

7831732 by restoring the colonel to what now seems his rightful position as a courageous principled radical who was dickinsons chosen reader admirer and advocate wineapple throws what she describes as a small considered beam upon the work and life of these two seemingly incompatible friends the recluse and the activist that beam when directed by a writer as thorough and intuitive as wineapple brightens not only the pale figures of the poet and the hitherto elusive colonel but the poems for which upon occasion dickinson drew inspiration from higginsons more active life

7831859 we are not interested in selling players who are committed to the club and essential to our first team squad

7831861 we have invested in players this summer identified by the manager who add to the quality of the squad and we will continue to do so as and when appropriate

7831966 it is not correct i never said that at least not in terms of resigning over a windfall tax i wasnt talking about resigning over anything i didnt make myself clear i never said or indicated that i would resign over a lack of a windfall tax my position is a backbencher or junior mp supports his or her government depending on the policies put forward by that party an extreme example is if a government announced that they were going to introduce a flat rate of income tax at 20 per cent my enthusiasm for supporting a labour government would be markedly decreased for obvious reasons
7831967 my enthusiasm for remaining a pps depends on the policy what we need and i did make this clear the difficulty facing the labour government its not the effect of the leadership but of policy we need new policies in the autumn and im presuming were going to get these one of these under consideration and which im on record supporting is a windfall tax but it is not a deal breaker for me it is not like 28 days pre trial detention of terror suspects on that i supported 90 days that is the sort of issue which raises strong views on both sides a big issue of principle that is the kind of resigning issue a windfall tax is not a resigning issue and i never indicated that it was

7832003 the u s is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in north korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq
7832004 visits to facilities review of documents interviews with technical personnel and other measures unanimously agreed upon among the six parties
7832005 the u s however raised all of a sudden an issue of applying an international standard to the verification of the nuclear declaration abusing this agreed point
7832006 it pressured north korea to accept such inspection as scouring any place as it pleases to collect samples and measure them
7832007 the measure is regrettable as it came at a time when the six parties have to make concerted efforts to complete phase two of the denuclearization process
7832008 will work closely with relevant countries to have north korea resume the disablement work as early as possible

7832022 this taliban organisation is a terrorist organisation and created mayhem against public life
7832023 as far as i can tell it is just meaningless how do you ban something which doesnt exist legally the taliban movement have never been formally registered so how do you ban them
7832024 even if the taliban doesnt exist formally it is nevertheless important that somebody has finally moved to proscribe them in this country
7832025 they have existed for a long time and no one previously has banned them
7832026 the ban would need to be followed up by much tougher action on the ground

7832108 you know very well the situation both in the valley and in jammu it is a matter of concern to us in the rest of the country there can be political debates but in j k we are playing with the security of the nation therefore we have to keep restraint
7832109 the government is making all out effort to bring normalcy in the state the task at hand is difficult i do not want to say anything more now already the government stand is very clear
7832110 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president

7832123 das minus im zweiten quartal geh rt mit dem enormen plus im ersten zusammen
7832124 alle unsere modelle sagen wenn berhaupt dann nur ganz leicht unter null vielleicht minus 0 1 oder minus 0 2

7832135 michelle has definitely been inspired by jackie kennedy onassis she had a look admired across the world so who would blame her
7832136 as first lady jackies style was all about matching colours subtle accessories and keeping the look demure if she follows jackies rules michelles outfits will never be revealing or loud enough to embarrass her husband
7832137 any day now i fully expect to see her in a pill box hat and three quarter length gloves a look which jackie made fashionable and all her own

7832170 you know youre slamming that door over and over youre creating a huge issue in this apartment building just the other day that lady he points to a door two doors down from mine and across the hall had some pictures fall off her wall because of you no one else is going around slamming their door in here
7832171 i really dont think im slamming my door because im not but i apologize if i am
7832172 oh yes you are the other day that door probably slammed thirty times youre really creating a hazard in this building
7832173 the biggest collapse in baseball history was oct 20 2004
7832174 let the door nob hit you where the good lord split you
7832175 i dont know what it is but it sure is funky
7832176 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7832177 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7832178 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7832179 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

7832192 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7832193 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7832194 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7832195 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7832196 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7832197 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7832198 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7832199 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7832200 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7832201 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7832202 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7832203 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7832204 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7832205 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7832206 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7832207 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7832208 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7832209 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7832210 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7832211 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7832212 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7832213 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7832214 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7832215 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7832216 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7832217 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7832218 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7832219 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7832220 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7832221 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7832222 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7832223 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7832224 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7832225 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7832226 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7832227 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7832228 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7832229 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7832230 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7832231 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7832232 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7832233 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7832234 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7832235 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7832236 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7832237 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7832238 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7832239 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7832240 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7832241 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7832242 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7832243 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7832244 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7832245 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7832246 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7832247 who are open to doing something on the production side
7832248 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7832249 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7832250 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7832251 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7832252 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7832253 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7832254 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7832255 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7832256 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7832257 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7832258 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7832259 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7832260 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7832261 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7832262 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7832263 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7832264 the prices of the companies in the exchange represent the communitys view on the valuations for these companies
7832265 i have signed decrees on the recognition by the russian federation of the independence of south ossetia and the independence of abkhazia
7832266 this is an unconcealed annexation of these territories which are a part of georgia
7832267 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
7832268 this is contrary to obligations that russia has repeatedly taken on in un security council resolutions it does nothing to improve the prospects for peace in the caucasus
7832269 the current atmosphere reminds me of the situation in europe in 1914 when because of one terrorist leading world powers clashed
7832270 i hope mikheil saakashvili the president of georgia will not go down in history as a new gavrilo princip

7832272 the uss mcfaul and another us ship will dock in poti on wednesday
7832273 there are georgian forces on one side ossetians on the other yes they are peacekeepers but we are afraid every single night that something will happen the only thing we want is peace i dont care who we are with russia or georgia

7832277 we will call for the alternative solution for the palestinian people and their leadership that is a single bi nationalist state
7832278 inevitably the vast majority of jewish israelis will view any talk about a one state solution as a threat even as an existential threat
7832279 the real choice is therefore the two state solution or the ethnic cleansing solution
7832280 in spite of eloquent and articulate views and analyses by palestinian intellectuals
7832281 the vast majority of the public according to public opinion polls and the majority of the political elite consider the idea of a bi national state a dangerous alternative strategy

7832295 to get the most out of migration local communities alongside local leaders businesses universities and central government need to recognise the variety of benefits that migrants can bring and plan accordingly
7832296 our population is increasing by a third of a million every year mainly due to immigration we will have to build the equivalent of the city of birmingham every three years just to cope with this
7832297 the public are rightly deeply opposed to the present massive levels of immigration without encouraging yet more
7832298 while the government cannot comment in detail given that the report is not yet published we recognise that migrants make an important contribution to the economy
7832299 the governments approach is to both maximise the benefits that migrants bring and to mitigate any transitional local impacts and that is why the communities secretary launched the migration impacts plan earlier this year
7832300 in addition the migration impacts forum chaired jointly by communities and home office regularly brings together government departments local authorities and others to look at evidence of local impact of migration and to spread good practice

7832310 its expected of me to just go up there and just do old songs but thats just too easy and thats not why were here we have a new record im not here to relive 89 im here to make the summer of 2008 a memory thats just as powerful thats why what im doing is a little different than what some of these other bands are doing
7832311 this is going to be the best summer of my life guys like and i have been doing this a long time we know how to kick your ass we have been putting on huge shows for a long time now these kids that go on american idol and expect to be big rock stars you dont learn that in one tv season its a lifelong pursuit of rock

7832313 it starts at the local level with your precinct delegates then it goes from a county level to a district level then up to a state level so theres probably 4 different levels and i made it all the way through those levels and i made it to the top
7832314 the challenge of course is to make sure that its equal to or better option than traditional schooling so i think its going to be a place for both in the short term at least and there are predictions that a great number of high school experiences will be associated with the internet in the future
7832315 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7832316 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7832317 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7832318 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7832319 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7832320 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7832321 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record

7832331 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7832332 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7832333 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7832334 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7832335 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
7832336 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7832337 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun

7832341 there used to be an organization for people who believed in a truly limited government limited taxes limited spending limited interference in individual lives and limited intervention in foreign affairs that organization was known as the republican party but the only one of those beliefs that still motivates the g o p establishment is limited taxes

7832344 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7832345 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis

7832353 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7832354 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7832355 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7832356 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7832357 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including mullah omar siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7832358 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7832359 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out high value targets
7832360 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7832361 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7832362 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track
7832363 the clinical team dr z and r have expressed their views and to be fair to them dr z has perhaps a more stronger way presented concerns about delusional disorder
7832364 i have given a commitment to people in the 9 11 truth movement to continue requesting an apology until i have been given one

7832369 one example is to use the browser as a very simple photoshop
7832370 editing an image requires things that for each step takes the better part of a second thats not a great user experience but with tracemonkey now you have something that comes close to interactive performance
7832371 we are planning for it to be there in firefox 3 1
7832372 it wont have all the capabilities theres more than a couple of months of work left but we are targeting 3 1
7832373 theres still a lot of room for improvement to benchmark javascript
7832374 but as an application developer the only benchmark you care about is how your application runs
7832375 theres no theoretical reason why it cant be as sharp and approach native code speeds in two to four years
7832376 all browsers have improved their javascript speed we focused on our tests
7832377 if you do the aggregate speedup which is the speedup for each test divided by the number of tests it is about 2 4 x faster
7832378 the driver 28 and his companion were taken to a place they did not know where the music system and tracker system were removed from the vehicle the taxi was driven to an unknown place and the two were stripped naked

7832389 the short answer is not really we dont seem to have noted that either of those things have had an impact
7832390 an army recruiter certainly wouldnt work a normal 40 hour week
7832391 they would probably work considerably longer they would spend a lot of time out visiting prospective recruiters in their homes and definitely do not work a regular week
7832392 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7832393 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7832394 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7832395 to discuss ways in which his foundation is addressing some of the worlds most pressing problems
7832396 president clinton understands this is sen obamas convention and he is here to do all he can to make sen obama our next president
7832397 were talking about the nominee for the president of the united states
7832398 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black

7832400 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7832401 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7832402 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7832403 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7832404 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7832405 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here

7832407 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7832408 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7832409 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7832410 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7832411 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7832412 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive

7832419 we continue to find the way to reach an agreement between israel and the palestinians
7832420 very heartened by the fact that the negotiations are serious and they are intensive
7832421 in fact i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together over this period of time
7832422 construction in the settlements has increased by a factor of 1 8 by comparison to the same period last year
7832423 the housing ministry initiated 433 new housing units during the period of january to may 2008 compared to just 240 units during the period january to may 2007
7832424 i would like to suggest to my partners not to use it as an excuse and i know they are not using it as an excuse but i understand their frustration sometimes
7832425 but at the end of the day the israeli governments policy is not to expand settlements not to build new settlements and not to confiscate palestinian land
7832426 there were some small activities but they will not influence the ability to negotiate nor the future of the future borders of the palestinian state
7832427 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and that anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7832428 and we will continue to press ahead to get agreement so that we know what is in israel and what is palestinian
7832429 it seems unlikely that flash 10 will be able to do any sort of uploading of any kind
7832430 police will use all means to restore normalcy as soon as possible
7832431 police will take decisive action against the protesters government restraint is almost over
7832432 i ask all the protesters who have been blockading or occupying government offices that you still have a chance to withdraw and go back to your homes
7832433 i will not resign i will stay to protect this country
7832434 the military will not allow the protesters to take control of the country however it is not the time yet for military force
7832435 the easiest way to restore normalcy is for prime minister samak to quit
7832436 if we do not receive a clear and positive response we will prolong the rally to the next day and mobilise more protesters
7832437 the military will not stage a coup detat the public must not panic and must carry on their daily lives the army will not get involved in politics
7832438 and lets stand together to elect barrack obama president of the united states of america
7832439 i think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming
7832440 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president
7832441 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world
7832442 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7832443 scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves
7832444 especially toward the end of the month i get a lot of e mails from women and theyre pretty desperate
7832445 had you asked me a year ago when i would have seen us expanding abroad again i would have said three to five years
7832446 bawag was simply too late with the expansion in central and eastern europe
7832447 the market share was far too small so it made more sense to take the money from the sale of the assets and use it for expansion in a more profitable field
7832448 this is the next step in a process aimed at recouping thelosses adcb has already incurred and additionally this is animportant step in paving the way for other gcc investors toensure they are provided an opportunity to recover their ownlosses

7832498 this action puts the commonwealth at the forefront nationally in ensuring integrity in racing
7832499 anabolic steroids should not be present in a horse that is racing
7832500 the betting public the other trainers and owners should be confident that the race is being run on a level playing field this rule will go a long way toward eliminating anabolic steroids from the sport
7832501 it is my intent to deem this issue an emergency so that the regulation can go into effect immediately

7832504 ten separate meetings with political parties and civil society groups including members of the central executive committee of the national league for democracy student representatives and elected individuals from the 1990 elections

7832581 david edevbie is the new principal secretary to the nigerian president if one goes by his qualifications and achievements alone david will be value added to the presidency
7832582 david is a harvard trained economist with extensive and impressive exposure in both public and private sectors
7832583 began his career with barclays bank london where he became managers assistant corporate lending over seeing multi million pounds investments in oil and mineral sectors of emerging markets
7832584 but his impressive professional career appears blotched by his association with the same former delta state governor james ibori whom he served under as commissioner of finance 2003 2005 and economic adviser 2006 2006
7832585 in december 2007 ibori was arrested over allegations of corruption and money laundering
7832586 as an observer far removed from the mystery within aso rock it is really perplexing that the president who appears keen on creating a corruption free government would be comfortable having a close associate and confidant of a man whose tenure as a state governor was heavily tarnished by corruption
7832587 the shake up in the administration of president umaru musa yaradua will be stepped up in the coming weeks as the president continues with his far reaching re jiggling one year after assuming office
7832588 fresh from the scrapping of some positions in the presidency and the sweeping changes in the military with the retirement of service chiefs yaradua is currently shopping for candidates to strengthen his cabinet
7832589 thisday was informed that in the current cabinet yaradua did not have much input as ex president olusegun obasanjo peoples democratic party pdp chieftains and pdp governors practically imposed their choices on him apparently as reward for those who helped him during the presidential election
7832590 the source added in fact obasanjo handpicked all the nominees from the south west and most of the nominees from other geo political zones that is why yaradua allowed them to be but now he is looking for his own ministers whom he can vouch for in terms of competence and performance

7832626 the games mark a new epoch an opening up of china that can never be reversed
7832627 it also means that ignorance and fear of china will steadily decline as the reality of modern china becomes more apparent
7832628 the policy of one china is not a piece of indulgent nationalism it is an existential issue if china is to hold together in a peaceful and stable manner as it modernises
7832629 this is why tibet is not simply a religious issue for china but a profoundly political one tibet being roughly a quarter of chinas land mass albeit with a small population
7832630 so we should continue to engage in a dialogue over the issues that rightly concern people but we should conduct it with at least some sensitivity to the way china sees them
7832631 we will have to come to terms with a world in which the power is shared with the far east

7832701 die ausf hrungen von wb generalsekret r kopf in seiner heutigen aussendung wonach eine allf llige mehrwertsteuersenkung nicht oder nur kurzfristig beim konsumenten landen w rde ist eine glatte unterstellung gerade auch die kaufleute und hier vor allem kleinere gesch fte leiden besonders unter umsatzeinbu en und w rden sich freuen billiger verkaufen zu k nnen

7832711 we are not interested in selling players who are committed to the club and essential to our first team squad
7832712 if a player refuses to sign a new contract or is not crucial to the managers plans then we will look at offers on a case by case basis it is the only sensible way to build for the future
7832713 we have invested in players this summer identified by the manager who add to the quality of the squad and we will continue to do so as and when appropriate

7832811 all political parties and religious leaders should come forward jointly and appeal for peace
7832812 the killing of an 82 year old man is a heinous crime and we condemn it but the sangh parivar is getting maximum benefit out of it
7832813 it appears that the government headed by the biju janata dal with the bjp as coalition partner has given a free hand to hindu groups
7832814 killing an 82 year old harmless religious leader who has rendered enormous service to the tribals in kandhamal is a very heinous crime every community should condemn this
7832815 duty bound to ensure that the conversion efforts of missionaries is stopped completely to ensured that such incidents are not repeated
7832816 failed to a great extent to control the violence by the vhp
7832817 whatever steps are required to maintain peace and harmony in all areas of orissa to prevent further attacks on christians and to arrest those responsible for the deaths of saraswati and his associates
7832818 it is a reflection of the fascistic mindset of these organisations that they could attack a place housing innocent unprotected children
7832819 the current spate of violence against christian clergy religious institutions including churches and service organizations such as orphanages is part and parcel of the sangh parivars larger conspiracy to turn state after state into a hindutva laboratory
7832820 it is a blatant lie and calibrated disinformation propagated by the organizations whose contribution to the nation was just chaos and destruction
7832821 christians have been living in orissa for the last 200 years still they constitute less than two percent of the population where is the evidence for these allegations but we want to know what is the contribution these organisations have given to indias social sector
7832822 subhan sahab was a real guru who guided me through the labyrinth of the eu and the complexities of eu india ties
7832823 he was an embodiment of what was good in the east and what was good in the west and he understood both the worlds very well
7832824 he was very much appreciated and respected by all of us at the international federation of journalists both as a colleague and as a good friend to journalism and journalists the world over
7832825 i am very sad to learn about malcolms passing away i had known him for many years and benefitted a great deal from his deep and sensitive understanding of european affairs said mr n n vohra the current governor in kashmir
7832826 he was a well known personality in all the european institutions and an expert on indian relations in the committee malcolm bought many valuable discussions to the fore particularly relating to culture and multicultural pluralism in both europe and india
7832827 some people knew malcolm as one of belgiums most gifted writers and editors particularly on indian economy he was one of a kind who will be sorely missed and never forgotten
7832828 is a great and irreparable loss for both our profession of journalism and gopio
7832829 his enthusiasm was boundless his energy was infectious and his knowledge of different aspects of eu india relations was unmatched
7832830 role and hard work in strengthening and enhancing indo european relations would not only be rememberd for long but it would also be a model for all of us and particularly the young generation
7832831 we deeply mourn his loss to the journalistic community several of us had the opportunity to interact and work with him we will miss him for long may god give his soul peace and may his family bear his departure with fortitude
7832832 many years ago as a young and inexperienced journalist covering european union eu affairs in brussels i was given precious friendly advice by a much respected senior indian colleague

7832839 there is no plan as yet to remove security from the chinese embassy the high security at the place will continue
7832840 however after the olympics have ended there is a definite reduction in the number of police personnel guarding the area
7832841 the security cannot be removed as yet tibetan activists are not going to sit back quietly after the conclusion of the olympics
7832842 the beijing paralympic games are going to take place shortly after that talks will take place between chinese government and the representatives of the dalai lama keeping both these in view security cannot be relaxed at the embassy
7832843 as of now we dont plan any protests or campaigns anywhere in the city but we are conducting meetings and any action would be taken only after that
7832844 its a huge day for us as a club in so many ways
7832845 this is a match we have to win to remain in contention for the play offs were all disappointed with the performance against the dragons but all we can worry about now is preparing properly to take on penrith
7832846 at the same time its important for the club as a whole and for the fans to honour ruben logan and wairangi who have all made such a big contribution to the warriors
7832847 it would be brilliant to see a massive crowd turn out to farewell the boys and also to help us along on what will be a critical day
7832848 axon is a global leader in its field we believe there is room for a counterbid closer to 700 pence a share
7832849 against the background of the global economic environment and increasing consolidation in the it services industry the combination with infosys represents a compelling proposition
7832850 the offer from infosys represents an attractive cash premium and provides certainty of value today for axon shareholders we are therefore unanimously recommending the offer to shareholders
7832851 infosys announced yesterday a recommended offer to acquire axon group to be implemented by way of a scheme of arrangement under the terms of the acquisition axon shareholders will receive for each axon share 600 pence including the interim dividend of 2 25 pence announced by axon today
7832852 as they have grown they have also begun attempting larger acquisitions with some moving towards offering higher margin consulting services
7832853 sap requires a real skill set and even though infosys already operates in the sector for a first piece of larger m amp a axon gives them a great leg up
7832854 our rationale was that with this acquisition our global reach scale and our ability to participate in large transformational deals would be significantly enhanced

7832882 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7832883 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

7832899 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7832900 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7832901 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7832902 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7832903 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7832904 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7832905 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7832906 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7832907 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7832908 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7832909 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7832910 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7832911 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7832912 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7832913 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7832914 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7832915 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7832916 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7832917 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7832918 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7832919 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7832920 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7832921 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7832922 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7832923 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7832924 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7832925 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7832926 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7832927 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7832928 eu assinei os decretos que reconhecem a independ ncia da oss tia do sul e da abkh zia
7832929 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7832930 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7832931 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7832932 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7832933 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7832934 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7832935 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7832936 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7832937 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7832938 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7832939 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7832940 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7832941 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7832942 australian artists in general are the hardest working people you will ever meet we can do for 100 what takes an american thousands to do that is why hollywood is full of australian ex pats young australian artists in all fields find it difficult to earn a living because most believe that self promotion is a dirty word and go to great lengths to avoid it in the case of visual art we have an ultra conservative gallery and academic system that prefers to prescribe what it considers to be legitimate art rather than surveying what is actually out there from a neutral point of view
7832943 this has been an unattractive affair my only interest was to establish the truth im happy that the court has made its declaration of falsity and that the authors and publishers have recognised their falsehoods and apologised as far as i am concerned thats the end of the matter
7832944 how do i attract a girl whos already in a relationship
7832945 i love to be a part of the creative process to help achieve someone elses vision and create something fantastic i love the idea of being immortalized on film and i love the feedback the fans all of it
7832946 it is often hard to believe that it is me who is in that magazine or me who is on tv
7832947 i am not snotty or full of myself i am lucky but i have worked hard too its not all about having the perfect body or the perfect face it is about what is inside
7832948 his death was hard i was in counseling for a long time
7832949 i remember he would tuck a razor blade in his boot
7832950 he would cut the same place on his head sometimes my mother sister and i would have to drive him to the hospital if he cut himself too deep
7832951 he talked bad about my father in interviews and i remembered that so when i met him i was mad at him
7832952 i totaled my car a week after getting it i had some roommate and living problems and so i asked to be moved to ohio valley wrestling in louisville ky
7832953 we both agreed that i needed to get out of tampa he said that they could talk again in six months
7832954 i want to show the wwe that i am still interested and wanting to return i am open to new opportunities and hope to wrestle and travel all over
7832955 i want to be the third generation of von erichs and make my granddad proud
7832956 he was someone with a good heart and a good person
7832957 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7832958 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7832959 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7832960 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7832961 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7832962 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

7832966 na de tweede wereldoorlog bleef europa gedesillusioneerd achter steden lagen in puin ook h rten lagen in puin hoe kon de holocaust plaatshebben kun je na auschwitz nog in god geloven veel nederlanders hebben vanwege die vragen de kerk verlaten het geloof in een persoonlijke god nam verder af daarmee nam de crisis inzake het gezag en de waarden en normen toe
7832967 in slechts enkele jaren stortten de traditionele zuilen in de overheid nam steeds meer taken over die vanouds door de kerken werden vervuld zo kreeg zij steeds meer invloed op het maatschappelijke leven ons land werd een verzorgingsstaat gezag van overheid ambtsdragers en ouders riep weerstand op tegelijk had in de jaren zestig ook de seksuele revolutie plaats waardoor het ene na het andere taboe in snel tempo werd opgeruimd
7832968 was de rebellie ten diepste niet gericht tegen de hemelse vader herkennen wij in de verloren zoon niet het hedonistische levensgevoel van onze dagen
7832969 als kerk voelen we pijn en schuld we zijn kennelijk niet in staat geweest om een helder en getrouw getuigenis van de liefde van de hemelse vader over te dragen ook de kerk is tot op het bot geraakt door alle maatschappelijke ontwikkelingen haar verscheurdheid is daarvan een schrijnend teken
7832970 voor een vaderloze en in menig opzicht ontspoorde samenleving wij geloven dat er hoop is voor verloren zonen en dochters die zich eerlijk de spiegel van het grote gebod voor laten houden we geloven dat er hoop is voor hun kinderen en kleinkinderen die nooit over de vader hebben gehoord hier liggen nieuwe kansen voor de kerk
7832971 aan de kerk vandaag stellen wij de vraag lijden wij er als kerk als gemeente aan dat er zo veel mensen uit ons midden zijn weggetrokken op zoek om elders hun geluk te beproeven willen wij als kerk openstaan voor die verloren zonen en dochters vinden zij een gastvrij huis in onze gemeente

7833022 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7833023 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7833024 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7833025 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

7833028 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7833029 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7833030 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7833031 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7833032 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7833033 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package

7833052 he bill clinton continues to make statements that are not supported by the facts whether its about my record of opposition to the war in iraq or our approach to organizing in las vegas this has become a habit and one of the things that were gonna have to do is to directly confront bill clinton when hes making statements that are not factually accurate
7833053 a few carefully chosen words and framing angles by the clintons have transformed obama from the post racial post partisan contender of universal appeal into a more typical african american candidate who is much less intrinsically attractive to whites and hispanics
7833054 to be an occasionally fierce critic of american domestic and foreign policy

7833058 visits to facilities review of documents interviews with technical personnel and other measures unanimously agreed upon among the six parties
7833059 the u s however raised all of a sudden an issue of applying an international standard to the verification of the nuclear declaration abusing this agreed point
7833060 it pressured north korea to accept such inspection as scouring any place as it pleases to collect samples and measure them
7833061 the measure is regrettable as it came at a time when the six parties have to make concerted efforts to complete phase two of the denuclearization process

7833069 for example including differences between california and the control states on a variety of risk factors did not materially affect the results
7833070 the methods in this study can be used to forecast future costs and will provide important additional means for validating program evaluations that previously did not exist

7833088 the good news for the rest of us is that just as it is poised to overtake america china will therefore find itself burdened with an aged population roughly 300 million pensioners by 2035 if the east is grey rather than red it may thus deny itself the gold medal of world domination

7833113 a hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to peace while a thousand wars raged across the span of human endeavor and today that new world is struggling to be born a world quite different from the one weve known a world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle a world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice a world where the strong respect the rights of the weak
7833114 theres going to be an independent kosovo were dedicated to that

7833156 nothing ive been writing has a definitive point of aim
7833157 i feel like you just need to keep writing until the writing itself just begins to take shape
7833158 the decision was made out here on the practice field with some of the things he does his leadership skills all those things
7833159 it was just a matter of getting enough information myself im an information gatherer i like to see it take a look at it and make sure i have enough information to make the right decisions and thats what i did
7833160 it really depends on the rest of the roster and what we see
7833161 one of the things you got to be careful of is that youre not keeping players just to keep players if were looking around here and we see another position where were keeping players just to keep players then i think the fourth quarterback becomes something that you think about why keep another guy at another position just to keep him when you can keep four quarterbacks you have two of them that are young guys and two of them that are veterans
7833162 as i said to the team at some point you have to look and you have to understand i got my opportunity one way or the other i did get my opportunity when you look and youve been evaluated since the day weve walked into the door here
7833163 theyve had over 500 throws apiece thats quite a bit of work
7833164 until were happy we have to make sure that we get the right people on this team
7833165 when you are taking people that are going to get waived one way or the other if there is somebody that were interested in bringing to the team we just want to make sure it was player 54 for another team that were trying to get
7833166 thats going to be a hard decision because they all do a lot of jobs
7833167 were just looking to see the best mix and that will probably go down to this week were trying to get a good feel for who can get us lined up back there and who we feel the most comfortable with
7833168 if phil can help us as a linebacker and a defensive end that helps us its no different than matt roth
7833169 he struggled at time with guys who have speed and good moves like say jason taylor
7833170 jandoh from what ive learned is not to jump on the bandwagon from the get go
7833171 no dont get me wrong i feel ya on this whole rookie thing and btw im a huge dolphin fan and have never left the bandwagon although we havent really been goin anywhere till now haha
7833172 can you ask chad pennington what he thinks of samson satele as a person
7833173 whatever the reason dont take the risk of missing out on the combines that is where you state your case for the draft not in some fluffy all star game
7833174 it seems like joey porters career could be over not good
7833175 thats going to be a hard decision because they all do a lot of jobs
7833176 well take our voices with our hands well make like knives well make demands im burning bridges for the last time im breaking habits for the first time i saw my future today it said im going away and i still havent sung the last line on my way down im not ready to lay im not ready to fade im not ready to die
7833177 the story the mainstream media wants to tell is mccain vs the base
7833178 thats just not there in this process we have found language and approaches that recognize how few the differences are and amplify the many agreements
7833179 the american peoples rejection of en masse legalizations is especially appropriate given the federal governments past failures to enforce the law
7833180 will insist on reasonable policies that do not force americans to sacrifice their way of life or trim their hopes and dreams for their children
7833181 i flip a coin to decide on which building to destroy but in the end i destroy them both
7833182 we arrested four foreigners nigerians who were using atm visa card to draw money from peoples account
7833183 i believe that is the only way of ensuring maximum value for taxpayers money and through that enhance resource mobilization
7833184 the ministry will continue to support initiatives of the ppa aimed at ensuring that public procurement is conducted with due attention to economy efficiency and value for money
7833185 the effective performance of the countrys procurement systems and practices would therefore determine the quantum of development needs and support to private sector that can be provided within a particular financial year
7833186 it is about time ghanaians stop boasting that we are the leaders in the sub region and face the realities since it is obvious that our sporting prowess and talent are on the downward trend and progressive measures needs to be taken to rectify the situation
7833187 it was our worst performance ever at the olympics and one can feel the disappointment of ghanaians at the games which goes a long way to reflect on the way we manage our sports with many blaming the over concentration on football to the neglect of other sporting disciplines
7833188 we must start our preparation by developing and putting into shape certain workable structures to develop sporting disciplines that can be of benefit to the countrys goal of utilizing and developing the sporting talents as the past
7833189 this acquisition seems to be very good in the long term it will accelerate infosys growth in europe and give it access to a very good customer portfolio
7833190 the impact of such a buy out would be too important for the operating margin
7833191 already has sap and software development expertise axon provides complementary expertise in the deployment in response to the needs of many vertical industries
7833192 in the field of erp developments can be offshored but consultancy must be done on site
7833193 i believe that things are going to go well for me regardless of the mountain i have in front of me and the adversity that stands before me regardless of how big that may seem for me i know im going to do whatever it takes to get over it
7833194 while im not saying cleo lemon was a world beater he was the qb at that time most prepared to lead the team to a victory they knew that but still put beck out there if beck has been working with the starting unit for more than two weeks id be singing a different tune but he didnt and was too green when he was named the starter if the approach this regime is taking with henne had been there for beck then it could have been different but it wasnt
7833195 i completely agree but im starting to think it would be best for beck to go somewhere he will be groomed properly my hope would be seattle where holmgren could work with him
7833196 i dont make things up people i just breakdown what i hear and see
7833197 must be a jamaican because hes got about 12 jobs for this team
7833198 john beck should try believing in himself instead of some mythical man made stories that are as realistic as fairy tales
7833199 while im on this rant if there is a god i dont believe he plays favorites so going to war under the banner of religion is unethical and immoral and god aint gonna help either side i also dont believe god plays favorites in sporting events fwiw
7833200 its no surprise to me our receivers started catching like flypaper with the addition of penne
7833201 which quarterback did you like coming out of college more chad henne or matt ryan
7833202 i just remmeber his absolute flop vs new orleans last year
7833203 however for everyone out here arguing about beck and or henne if you honestly look at their play cant you see more potential in henne
7833204 first i evaluate his performance as a wr not a returner if he turns out to be a great return guy and an average wr he still isnt doing what he was drafted to do and from what ive read b c i dont get to see any games his return was mostly a product of good blocking all he had to do was run so yes i think hes been mediocre so far what can you show me to refute the claim
7833205 as for ginn i disagree there i think hes had a great preseason all around people eric keep throwing out his stats and saying theyre mediocre but forget to acknoledge hes not playing the entire game
7833206 pennington is far to long to type everytime and i kinda like the sound of penny cp is okay
7833207 who wrote this oh omar then its ok hell be fine
7833208 jahndoh you sure do think you can dictate what other fans like or dont like
7833209 over the past year the citys four major sports teams the dolphins marlins heat and panthers have combined to win just 40 percent of their games while fans have forked over money for tickets and accouterments at the seventh highest rate among 29 major sports metros throw in a 38 632 median household income for the greater miami area fifth lowest of the 29 markets along with a 292 50 price tag for a family of four to see a game and the citys pro sports scene ranks as the worst deal in the country by our accounting thats what happens when the nba heat and nfl dolphins combine to go 16 82 during the 2007 08 season more than offsetting the competitiveness of baseballs young florida marlins
7833210 arguement that ryan had no competition because beck didnt have much competition either and he still lost
7833211 he ravens were praying that ryan would fall to them also beck couldnt beat out a career loser and a rookie this training camp and is about to get tossed off the team so dont come with the arguement that ryan had no competition because beck didnt have much competition either and he still lost
7833212 i dont make things up people i just breakdown what i hear and see
7833213 if he turns out to be a great return guy and an average wr he still isnt doing what he was drafted to do
7833214 jahndoh i dont know if ginn is the real deal or not ill admit that my response was to find a bottle of aftershock after we reached for him and his family at 9 last year but were married to him as fans of the team so i sure as hell hopes he succeeds just because you call it like it is sometimes i e ginn was a reach beck needs a new start etc doesnt mean that as a fan of the team you shouldnt be willing to admit when youre wrong im rooting for ginn to prove me wrong because that after all is what real fans do
7833215 as for ginn im not as interested in the stats as some other guys i dont think they really tell the story on every player i will say right off the bat that i expect a 9 pick to be a topflight wr and i just dont think ginn will ever be that
7833216 you should gain some seriously good insight with those tactics
7833217 again hope im wrong but you cant frame the discussion about the 9 pick around returning skills
7833218 a lot of the people on this board have to eat crow most people here didnt even want henne but now they have reversed their opinion
7833219 ginn reminds me of a neighbors cousin whos best friends wifes uncle thinks ginn reminds him of a mixture of randy moss steve smith and bernard berrian
7833220 jahndoh you rooted for beck much more than the other quarterbacks
7833221 shula actually changed the offense from a run first offense to an east coast air coryell type offense john beck doesnt fit what miami wants to do which is to establish a power running game and take long shots down the field he is a typical west coast type of qb cameron drafted him to be a west coast type of qb
7833222 jahndoh calm down before you give yourself a heart attack i wouldnt ever ever ever ever ever ever want to hear that that happened to you
7833223 mov ed into prominent roles in the two deep this fall

7833430 west ham united have absolutely no intention of selling craig bellamy he is under contract and is committed to the club craig remains a very important part of our plans for the future
7833431 the club is being run on sound football and business principles in order to develop a squad which can deliver success this season no player would be bought or sold unless that helped to achieve that aim
7833432 we are not interested in selling players who are committed to the club and essential to our first team squad
7833433 if a player refuses to sign a new contract or is not crucial to the managers plans then we will look at offers on a case by case basis it is the only sensible way to build for the future
7833434 we have invested in players this summer identified by the manager who add to the quality of the squad and we will continue to do so as and when appropriate
7833435 there are procedures in place and we will adhere to them the first step in that is to consider the referees report
7833436 without naming names i do want to make the point that the 2003 world cup coaching team effectively left no legacy to the english game
7833437 as a result the elite end of the sport in this country was in a terrible state
7833438 you could argue that the head coachs job is to win the world cup we want martin johnson to win the next world cup so does he
7833439 but if as head coach you divorce yourself from the rest of the business structure which is what happened before and after the 2003 world cup you leave a massive void
7833440 english rugby was like a giant oil tanker going in the wrong direction and beginning to leak i said at my interview that it could take three years to stop the leakage and turn the ship round
7833441 i make no apology for being completely ruthless in my approach over the last two three four years we have witnessed some england performances which were not what you would expect from a group of players representing the biggest union in the world
7833442 english rugby has had its moments of true glory but for consistent results new zealand are always there year in year out we should be there with them
7833443 it would be nonsense to say three years out from the next world cup that we are going to win it but we have the high quality players coming through to know that we will at least go close
7833444 according to the agreement with nif and xlri the regional research advisory council would assess the innovations made at the grassroots in bihar bengal jharkhand chhattisgarh the body would later provide marketing strategies for the launch of these innovative ideas in the market

7833446 we are not revealing the innovations for we are in the process of patenting these innovations in the founders name so they can be saved from being copied

7833487 these fools so blinded by their divine right that they dare not glance outside their sycophant advisors opinions
7833488 so tell me what am i to do with you cagliostro

7833492 are you the last scion of rakoczy and prince of

7833565 we knew some folks would ask why we couldnt make it a move permanent so we decided to stay our clients may be homeless but this is their neighborhood their community and their neck of the woods uprooting them would be no more fair than if you did that to any other neighborhood

7833567 if theyre fenced in and surrounded by protests noise and crowds
7833568 we have to go on standstill just because of those people
7833569 when they put those tarps up we knew what they thought about us its about making the city pretty thats what its all about
7833570 were not trying to hide them nor are we trying to put them on display we have a fundamental belief in the dignity of every human person and we are trying to get people to hear the voices of the poor
7833571 frankly they are hardly ever heard by anyone in our political system
7833572 well looking at you all sweaty and walking down makes me pretty concerned

7833584 the trips are different i just want to take the visits and have some fun and see some places i havent seen
7833585 i like all these schools and all the coaches and i want to go and see them in person
7833586 they have a real aggressive defense and they said that i could play as a freshman there they need linebackers and i could really help them its a pretty good team every year and they always seem to go to bowl games
7833587 that it doesnt get any better and that they are all about tradition
7833588 hes really excited about the new coaches and expects them to be competing for the national championship within a few years
7833589 i know coach rich rodriguez is a great coach and i like the changes they are making but this year will definitely be a building season
7833590 theyve got the speed and the athletes i dont think anyone will be able to match up with their wide receivers
7833591 i think that florida is the favorite to win it all this year
7833592 i went to the west virginia camp and it was a lot of fun
7833593 im excited to see a game there the coaches are all real cool and the campus was great
7833594 i liked them because they always had great players and sent everybody to the nfl
7833595 they never really recruited me and i think they are pretty deep at linebacker already
7833596 im real aggressive and i play smart i try to be a student of the game and play physical fast and hard
7833597 i want to improve on my coverage skills and get more picks
7833598 cera una sorta di competizione tra noi per vedere chi fosse llovegossip myblog it

7833600 now were looking forward to the champions league game against liege and we know how important it is to make sure we get into the group stages
7833601 im looking forward to a brighter future to go and play for an important club maybe in the european champions league
7833602 i want to go to a big club that will bring up more values and bring up the skills and that talent which i have in me
7833603 now im going back to my club to discuss terms with them because this is my future there are so many offers for me and i think its high time i leave ive played three seasons there and i think ive helped them
7833604 i wanted to leave them last season they begged me they said that i should stay so that i will come back to serie a and then i can leave
7833605 they gave me their word so they have to fulfil their promise
7833606 we paid good money for him and since then he has played more than 20 premier league games
7833607 anyone who thinks his value has halved has another think coming
7833608 he has done very well for us in pre season has looked good in training in the first few weeks of this season and hes a good squad player
7833609 hes not getting them here and this is a good move for him
7833610 what it took for him to get here was something i never thought id see in my life
7833611 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7833612 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7833613 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7833614 to discuss ways in which his foundation is addressing some of the worlds most pressing problems
7833615 president clinton understands this is sen obamas convention and he is here to do all he can to make sen obama our next president
7833616 were talking about the nominee for the president of the united states

7833628 ok accetto ma ti avviso meglio che non permetti a tua moglie e ai tuoi figli di guardare questo match perch finirai molto male fra due settimane ad unforgiven
7833629 unforgiven pensa al significato di questa parola io non ti perdoner mai chris jericho per quello che hai fatto a me e alla mia famiglia devi capire che non mi interessa vincere il match o fare il match pi bello dello show una sola cosa conta occhio per occhio

7833694 m s parece un mecanismo de distracci n que un asunto relevante para el examen de los problemas colombianos de hoy a los ciudadanos les consta que he sido respetuoso del jefe del estado y he tratado de ser objetivo y ponderado lamento el lenguaje grosero intemperante y agresivo del presidente uribe
7833695 le quiero recordar al presidente que nuestros senadores y representantes son libres de expresar sus opiniones en relaci n con el acontecer pol tico y que eso va a ser as mientras en colombia haya estado de derecho el cual esta puesto en grave peligro por un presidente que quiere silenciar y subordinar a cada uno de sus contradictores a los periodistas y a los otros poderes

7833725 im going to have cute boobs till im 90 so theres that ill have the best boobs in the nursing home
7833726 what should the government do with the kidnappers of ces drilon and company
7833727 to me theres a great chance of winning the money list ive done it in europe and itd be very nice to do it in the states i think thats number one motivation theres an opportunity for all us guys to do it now
7833728 they are big tournaments and obviously i have one eye on the world rankings realistically i am just trying to win the money title which is now the fedex cup
7833729 anybody in the top 10 can win this fedex cup if they get at least one win and follow it up with another couple of good performances
7833730 anybody outside that might need two wins but theres a lot to play for in that sense and im ready to go
7833731 after winning two majors youd kind of think i could do with a rest but theres other things to play for so thats why im here this week im looking forward to playing the barclays classic
7833732 i remember last year how i struggled in the first couple of fedex events and i had to pull out of the third because i was fatigued but this time round i feel better stronger and motivated theres lots to play for
7833733 it was an interesting week i sat by the pool for most of it come sunday i was kind of thinking id like to sit there for another week
7833734 to that extent the fedex cup is a success its what is attracting me out here again and that was the idea of it to get players to compete at this time of the year
7833735 kenny wasnt afraid to ask a couple of people to make the contact with me i love to talk as you know though i will mention the fact that i had a talk with the dublin football team a few years ago and the following day they went out and lost to carlow it was a bit of an upset
7833736 i wont say ive a hundred per cent record in these things but its great to see kenny doing well and for me to have someone to follow were wishing him the best going forward
7833737 a couple of times in the past athletes have come and asked for advice kenny being one of them he came to my house and basically was talking about how to peak how to go to a big time event and produce your best performance
7833738 he was obviously a very talented competitor himself knew what to do but felt he probably was slightly underachieving at the big event
7833739 he came and we had a good day together i went through a few things i gave him a bit of advice and a few books to read and its good to see its paying off
7833740 yet i wont take credit for it boxers put in an incredible amount of work and its nice that hes been saying these things
7833741 one of the keys i put across to him at the time is his ability to do his own thing and be self sufficient and concentrate on his own performance and not be distracted i think he is doing that
7833742 i would suggest there should be only one thought in his head at this stage and thats semi final bout and not getting drawn up into how hes done so far
7833743 im 36 years of age and ive spent probably 20 years gaining the experience i have when you think that some olympic athletes some of these gymnasts for example are asked to be worldly experienced at 16 years of age which is an incredibly difficult thing to do
7833744 the only way to learn experience without actually going through it yourself is to learn from somebody else learn from books and listening to other people
7833745 the great thing about kenny as i was at 18 years ago age i was motivated to seek help outside of the mainstream i started working with a sports psychologist at age 18 and at that time you didnt mention it because it might have been seen as a sign of weakness
7833746 the better players in all sports seek out the best possible help and try to put the best possible team behind them
7833747 very deep is the well of the past should we not call it bottomless
7833748 sometimes it is better to not make bad copies of good things

7834204 christopher lasch observed that undergraduates in recent years have shown declining interest in big theoretical nondebates about the nonissues of structuralism and post structuralism and postmodernism and marx and lacan and foucault speaking to the graduating class at the university of rochester in 1993 lasch maintained that it s not that they re interested only in jobs though in view of the state of the economy thy could easily be excused for thinking exclusively about jobs rather said lasch it s just that they want to hear some plain words of truth they want to grow up as for the other half of the nightmare technique without ideals one cannot discount the influence on students of extraordinary teachers who unabashedly love the law and the experiment in ordered liberty it serves that sort of law professor will always be rare but after all it only takes one great teacher to change a person s life forever the great one influence students no so much by their eloquence and wit as by their way of being in the world the eros of the mind is contagious

7834210 everybody always said if you can get through the institute you can get through law school
7834211 it exposed us and gave us a precursor to what to expect

7834219 worcester will be tough i think its their last game before the end of their pre season and they will send a strong side over theyll be ready for the start of the premiership
7834220 they are a very physical side so it will be another step up again
7834221 but if we perform like that against queensland i cant see why we cant beat them
7834222 i know a few of the worcester guys and obviously they might have chris latham as well
7834223 they have always boasted a big physical pack and they base their game around that it will be a direct game and a real stern test
7834224 although it was a good win against the reds we cant go over the top about it and there is still a lot to improve
7834225 im sure well go through the video and find those things at the start of the game our forwards were immense and they gave us the platform
7834226 queensland turned the ball over a few times and that allowed us to push them back
7834227 we put pressure on them but we were disappointed not to get more points in the first half thats something we need to work on our patience and the execution of a few plays but all in all it was a good start
7834228 i thought we did very well and we kept them to zero which was one of our big aims our penalty count was still a wee bit high so well have to look into that before the magners league starts i thought it was a big improvement on last week in all facets of play
7834229 worcester are a big side with some big names and it will be a real step up for us after the bath and queensland reds games
7834230 they were very different games which was good in many respects and we are looking to improve again in certain areas it will be a great test for us

7834242 i have been a friend of hillarys for a very long time i joined her fan club four years ago i will vote for hillary here this week and then i will support obama i dont want to but i will i dont think he has been very respectful to hillary

7834387 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7834388 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7834389 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7834390 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

7834393 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7834394 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7834395 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7834396 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia

7834406 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7834407 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7834408 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

7834498 incense is sold without a warning label and given the high prevalence of use and the often involuntary nature of the exposure clarifying the role of incense smoke as a carcinogen is important from a public health perspective
7834499 it could be relevant for priests and others who are regularly exposed to incense

7834505 during everyday life we constantly evaluate social behavior and this largely affects how we feel about ourselves and other people
7834506 but the way we store and use information about our own and other peoples social behavior are not well understood
7834507 this latest study used functional brain imaging to identify the circuits in the brain that underpin our ability to differentiate social behavior that conforms to our values from behavior that does not
7834508 the most distinctive feature of depressive disorders is an exaggerated negative attitude to oneself which is typically accompanied by feelings of guilt
7834509 now that we understand how the brains of healthy individuals respond to feelings of guilt we hope to be able to better understand why and where there are differences in brain activity in people suffering from or prone to depression
7834510 the brain region we have identified to be associated with proneness to guilt has been shown to be abnormally active in patients with severe depression in several previous studies but until now its involvement in guilt had been unknown
7834511 by translating these basic cognitive neuroscience insights into clinical research we now have the potential to discover new key functional anatomical characteristics of the brain that may lie behind depressive disorders
7834512 as most tanks are kept outside of the home they can pose easy targets to thieves average oil prices have doubled since the start of the year and rising inflation has meant that many people can no longer afford the premium prices this has helped the growth of a black market economy in domestic oil fuel
7834513 there are security precautions that can be taken to help prevent this type of crime but it is imperative that homeowners not only pre emptively protect their fuel but also have adequate insurance so that they do not find themselves footing the bill if the oil does get stolen

7834516 businesses are finding it tough at the moment with increased interest rates and an inability to actually service their loans arson is one of the ways in which they will try and get out of the problem simply by burning the business down and hoping that the insurance company is going to pick up the bill

7834522 its critical for brands to reach this market they realize that
7834523 this is something new that kind of already requires awareness because a lot of this is driven through peoples perception of the product
7834524 when youre sharing an affinity for something its kind of hard to grasp exactly what new products encompass without knowing what they already are
7834525 so thinking that theyre going to do engagement ads and that its going to be success alone isnt going to be sufficient
7834526 global warming isnt a pretty suv ad its a frightening reality
7834527 the brands should roll with the negative feedback and listen and incorporate some of that feedback in their upcoming products
7834528 the last thing they should do is shut the ads down
7834529 theres a large amount of social responsibility that comes into play here
7834530 when youre sharing peoples opinions and associating them with certain things it takes a personal attachment that hasnt been used in advertising before
7834531 what they need to do is develop resources for the marketers that will help them be more confident
7834532 maybe the company could develop a marketing conference for marketers on facebook their developer conference in san francisco was huge why arent they doing this for the brands
7834533 facebook is throwing all kinds of pasta at the wall when it comes to marketing and to see what sticks
7834534 they havent figured it out and unfortunately theyre using brands as the guinea pigs and their customers they really have to make it clear to their community what works and what doesnt and develop best practices sooner or later

7834543 i think its fair to say there was muffled consternation in the first few seconds
7834544 people were clearly suffering with the shock of it but on the whole people had a stiff upper lip about it and they were resigned to their fate they were properly terrified
7834545 they thought they were going to meet their maker and thats not an exaggeration

7834553 this is a serious issue rightly rated critical by red hat and while there may not be cases of widespread exploitation of it it does require prompt and direct response i think red hat is doing that and in the end i think this issue will be highlighted by the companys response
7834554 that would be very bad indeed although red hat says that no updates appear to have been compromised
7834555 the debian openssl issue was another significant security matter both illustrate some of the security concerns internal breaches or code corruption that may be more specific to open source
7834556 most enterprise users of linux and open source software are coming to trust it and increase their use in general i dont think this will impact that trend
7834557 red hat customers have cause to be aware and to be concerned but with any enterprise grade operating system there are going to be security issues this is why i believe it is the vendors response that is most critical customers are being kept aware and updated with patches so i would say the issue is being handled adequately
7834558 the project aims to harvest 14 million cubic metres 494 4 million cu ft of timber worth about us 4 billion

7834564 our principal focus right now has been on the india civil nuclear deal having worked through the iaea now working through the nsg and still trying to get into a position to make the appropriate presidential determinations in early september so thats our focus right now on the civil nuclear side
7834565 i think we have another nuclear agreement in the queue ahead of that russian deal that were really focussed on right now and thats the india civil nuclear agreement and thats generating a lot of work and time and energy on our part to get that done
7834566 we were able to work that through the iaea and now working with the nsg and trying to get that through nsg and eventually for presentation to our congress

7834571 well it gets strong enough at times it is hard to walk around in it and for protection we have ways of measuring this
7834572 everyone here has a log chain hanging on the tail of their windmill in mild breezes the chain trails back at an angle in a medium to strong wind the chain extends straight back from the tail on days when we take caution the chain begins to whip and we definitely stay inside when links begin to snap off the ends of these chains
7834573 down where i live we gauge wind with a barbed mire fence if the barbs are all within 90 degrees of each other its windy but when they all line up together look out
7834574 we had a homesteader next to us on the south he was lean and thin from hard work on one windy day he went out to round up some cows and while on his way the wind skidded him down into a sand creek he had in order to finish his job and get mobile again he had to think of some way to overcome the strength of the wind he wrapped baling wire around his overall legs at his ankles filled his pants up to his crotch with sand and thus was able to keep himself anchored to the ground when he reached his cows they were lying down in the grass with their feet braced against the wind to keep from rolling over needless to say the homesteader gave up and laid down with the cows until the wind let up
7834575 when i was world number two my goal was the same to win the us open but the goal wasnt win the us open to be world number one the goal is win us open no
7834576 u s corn and soybean conditions worsened last week because of dry conditions in parts of the midwest

7834585 last fall south dakota businessman steve polley was scouting for ways to make some extra income when he saw a news headline the price of hops was surging because of a global shortage
7834586 at the time mr polley knew little about hops the flowering plants that give beers their distinct aromas and bitterness now helped by a state agricultural grant the 67 year old is preparing for his first hops harvest on a small plot on his neighbors land in spearfish s d
7834587 mr polley is among a small but rising number of newcomers to attempt to grow hops on a commercial scale outside the pacific northwest americas haven for hops one of the most obscure crops in a long line of agriculture commodities to enjoy a recent price boom hops are sprouting in numerous other locales from colorado to wisconsin to new york the growers aim to capitalize on hop prices that are as much as sixfold higher than a few years ago as well as the nations boom in small batch craft brewers like colorados new belgium brewing co and odell brewing co which are thirsty for locally grown hops

7834594 hungary opposes several points of the common agricultural policy cap health check and some sharp disputes are expected this autumn between hungary and the european commission
7834595 the eu wants to make farm policy more market oriented while hungary sees the potential to expand its production by 30 percent with the help of eu funding
7834596 deputy farm minister zoltan gogos told the paper that the ministry had raised several objections in brussels
7834597 hungary also stands opposed to the eus plan to stop direct payments to farmers with land of below 1 hectare because this would affect many farmers in hungary where the minimum size for farms is 0 3 hectare he added
7834598 france the current holder of the eu presidency sees reaching a consensus on the cap health check a priority he said
7834599 above 35 mph there is an external combustion system which is basically a heater that uses a little bit of gasoline or biofuel or ethanol or vegetable oil that will heat the air
7834600 heating the air increases its volume and by increasing its volume it increases the cars range thats why with one gallon of gasoline or its equivalent we are able to make over 100 mpg
7834601 no ones really proven a six seater passenger car can get any better than 75 miles to the gallon so this would represent a big step forward
7834602 they would have to prove that before they can throw rocks at the prius
7834603 that is above what you normally find even in an industrial setting

7834634 i signed because warner brothers who are producing the film had approached me warner brothers is an international giant so i could not refuse them
7834635 they are senior actors with a lot of experience i had a great learning experience while working with them in the movie
7834636 i am playing a character which is more real and underplayed it has been an experimental experience as i have done something which i had never done before
7834637 i wont reveal much about what i do in the movie as that will take away the charm of watching it but one thing i can say for sure is that people will not see me running around trees or performing any dance or item numbers
7834638 his sense of comedy was intelligent bizarre and slapstick with simple narration and direction i have never been an assistant director to anyone but i carefully observed hrishikesh das style of filmmaking his films had substance
7834639 todays comedies dont stand a chance in front of his films i think the closest one to his style was munnabhai m b b s that is the one film in recent times that he would have been very proud of
7834640 when you watch todays comedies you feel that a lot of effort and pain is taken to elicit laughter i dont think that was his approach
7834641 i find it strange when i meet people who are born after golmaal was released and they say they like his mukherjees films and they watch these films over and over again his comedies were free flowing and natural
7834642 i remember him as a warm and caring person i never felt intimidated despite being new on the sets when i was working in golmaal i was a mother of two young daughters he used to tell other senior artistes i will finish her scenes first so that she can go home and be with her children
7834643 its more difficult to portray simple emotions on screen than complex ones and thats why i try to delve more into such themes i try to make my films like sugar coated messages but the sugar should not exceed the medicine
7834644 as a kid i used to watch hrishikesh mukherjees films in my video library his films inspired me as they spoke about real issues and treaded a real path while being commercial and entertaining
7834645 though i am still learning over the years i try to be inspired by great filmmakers like him i hope a few decades down the line i get the same kind of love affection and recognition as greats like hrishikesh mukherjee get more than 50 years after making their first film
7834646 i tried to imbibe his style in heyy babyy in terms of the interplay of characters i tried to keep it simple just like hrishikesh da i tried not to use many gimmicks
7834647 if it comes to my top three favourite films hrishikesh das golmaal and chupke chupke are two of them if you consider books timeless classics are not made by their content but by the number of times one can read it and still enjoy them hrishikesh mukherjees films are also like that you can watch them so many times and still not get bored his films were so light and frothy

7834667 leaky gut syndrome is a hypothesis associated with autism by people who believe that toxins particularly those caused by vaccines notably the mmr weakens the lining of the bowel letting various rubbish thorough undigested food toxins whatever and triggering an immune response and or leading to wakefields much hyped but never backed up autistic enterocolitis
7834668 in fact its not curious at all as the only groups that did find evidence for autistic enterocolitis used the now discredited unigentics lab run by john oleary
7834669 do they have them in numbers over and above the nt population
7834670 if such dysfunction is present at the time of infections and immunizations in young children the added oxidative stresses from immune activation on cellular energy metabolism are likely to be especially critical for the central nervous system which is highly dependent on mitochondrial function young children who have dysfunctional cellular energy metabolism therefore might be more prone to undergo autistic regression between 18 and 30 months of age if they also have infections or immunizations at the same time
7834671 this statement is not correct olearys tests found measles dna samples in tissues they did not validate autistic enterocolitis autistic entercolitis is a pattern of observed symptoms in the gut not something that needed verification from oleary
7834672 there is no increased intestinal permeability in autism autistic kids are not stoned on opiods autism is not reversible by diet thats what all this is about
7834673 we have identified a chronic enterocolitis in children that may be related to neuropsychiatric dysfunction in most cases onset of symptoms was after measles mumps and rubella immunisation further investigations are needed to examine this syndrome and its possible relation to this vaccine
7834674 i would be very surprised if they could make any sort of prevalence conclusions based on a study group of 8 children
7834675 your statement implies that gi problems are just as prevalent in the normal population as they are in autistic children that doesnt sound correct at all
7834676 it was another of those things that was made up for the
7834677 i understood the hypothesis to be that persistent measles infection in the gut would lead to autistic entercolitis and then leaky gut syndrome
7834678 i didnt think it was the toxins but the measles virus itself which was implicated in the hypothesis thats why the pcr test results are so heavily debated because they could validate or invalidate that portion of the hypothesis
7834679 once we see symptoms of autistic entercolitis do we have leaky gut syndrome
7834680 this statement is not correct olearys tests found measles dna samples in tissues they did not validate autistic enterocolitis
7834681 of course we now know of a mechanism where a strong immune response to any vaccine or illness including mmr can trigger autistic regression in susceptible children without any gut interaction
7834682 persisten measles infection doesnt lead anywhere but death didnt you read the omnibus transcripts
7834683 back to the omnibus chadwick all of wakefields measles in the gut detections were false positives and he told wakefield before the publication of the lancet paper what does that tell you about wakefields honesty morals and ethics
7834684 there is no such entity as autistic enterocolitis inventing things does not confer instant validation
7834685 back to the omnibus bustin the nucleic acid detected was indeed virus so there is no such thing as measles dna bustins conclusion was that the whole lab was contaminated with dna source probably human
7834686 schwartz meu bem i have no idea what your central point is something to do with wackers initial description of autistic enterocolitis an entity so non specific as to be meaningless
7834687 who cares but that does not excuse your continuous production of erroneous statements if you could stick to the facts whatever it is you are arguing it would be much appreciated

7834718 federal authorities have scheduled a press conference for tuesday afternoon amid reports that a fortunate traffic stop by aurora police may have disrupted an assassination attempt against barack obama
7834719 a witness interviewed in the case said one of suspects allegedly said the guns were to be used to kill the illinois senator but authorities do not believe the alleged threat put obama in immediate danger authorities told abc news the men had tattoos of white supremacist images

7834726 its unclear precisely why authorities suspect the men were targeting barack obama but one of the officers who was briefed says he was told at least one of the suspects made statements to that effect
7834727 the secret service atf and the fbi are all involved in the investigation a secret service spokesman says the agency is concerned by the proximity to the convention and the items found in the mans car
7834728 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out

7834774 extortionists may be extremists an organised crime group a disgruntled employee seeking retribution or even a competitor trying to gain a greater market share
7834775 clearly there are high profile cases where a retailer for example is targeted by an extortionist for financial gain or where a pharmaceutical company is targeted by activists in reality extortion happens at a very local level too
7834776 extortion whether carried out by a disgruntled former employee or an organised criminal is often a discreet affair
7834777 forward planning is the key companies should identify a response team involving the right people with the right skill sets and ensure that all the predictable decisions are made before something happens a live crisis makes a very poor learning environment and the correct response can make the difference between successfully managing the threat and serious damage to your brand and reputation

7834782 an important part of what im about what makes me tick
7834783 shes on the phone with the world food program hes on the phone with saakashvili
7834784 its like this great picture of what theyll be like in the white house
7834785 theres a whole bunch of things going on right now and as we begin to move refugees from point a to point b or try to feed refugees who are stuck in pockets around the country were running into the issue of the blowing up of humanitarian vehicles that are trying to get to the refugees so its a whole morass of problems now
7834786 you dont need just another republican substitute for young and stevens you need a whole new change
7834787 its going to be very difficult for the democrats to run on corruption if sean parnell wins on an anti corruption platform
7834788 i really really felt like she was the most qualified candidate hes new hes inexperienced
7834789 bottom line is i would never vote for john mccain
7834790 weve been very pleased that so many who supported sen clinton in the primary have taken active roles in the obama campaign
7834791 organizing raising money and most importantly talking to their friends and neighbors about the clear choice in this election
7834792 joe biden certainly brings a lot of baggage to the democratic ticket this year and some of the baggage matches that of barack obama
7834793 all i know is joe cari is a friend and hes an honorable guy but i dont know anything beyond that
7834794 mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just eight years old
7834795 why does barack obama have a relationship with an unrepentant terrorist
7834796 why is barack obama not being forthcoming about his relationship
7834797 the trip gives us an opportunity to move forward both here in the u s government and also with our counterparts in europe who want to support georgias economic and military reconstruction
7834798 developments lately in georgia have increased the importance of this visit
7834799 to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7834800 cheney certainly has had a tougher view on russia than some others in the administration
7834801 would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
7834802 russias reputation has suffered since it took these disproportionate military steps in georgia
7834803 joe biden is huge he could be the difference in places like pennsylvania ohio even indiana
7834804 he can talk to the labor folk in their language you go in there you dont wear a suit or tie and you connect thats what hes good at
7834805 hillary was my first choice but biden was my second choice
7834806 he was one of the best in the debates and hell be a good debater
7834807 we spent an enormous amount of money and time and a full time unit of people looking under every stone it wasnt like we did not know anything about her
7834808 and we thought her position on this was pretty reasonable
7834809 i will tell you having visited israel just a month and a half ago their general attitude is we will not allow iran to get a nuclear weapon
7834810 my job as president would be to try to make sure we are tightening the screws diplomatically on iran that we mobilize the world community to go after irans nuclear program in a serious way we have to do it before israel feels its back is against the wall
7834811 today an american flag still marks the surface of the moon
7834812 and so with barack obama for you and for me for our country and for our cause the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7834813 it looks to me that it would be governor minner unless we go into the january 20 scenario
7834814 if the loser is carney its very easy to see governor minner who has endorsed him as her successor appointing him if he would like that office its a little harder to see if the loser is jack markell
7834815 i have a very honorable opponent there are stark differences between us
7834816 i know you have students who come from all over the world i know there are people here who come from countries some from iraq where they have seen the look of war and sacrifice
7834817 hes been a fighter for the hispanic community hes been a fighter for the immigration issue
7834818 i think that it is no secret and ive said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think the settlement activity is helpful to the process
7834819 what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7834820 in the end of the day the role of the leaders is to try to find a way to live in peace in the future and not to let any kind of noises that relate to the situation on the ground these days to enter the negotiation room
7834821 use it as an excuse and i know they are not using it as an excuse but i understand their frustration sometimes
7834822 will continue our efforts to reach a historic agreement before the end of the bush administration
7834823 used to be he is not my he was not hillarys supporter not ever not for a day
7834824 i just dont i respect him and i am sorry if he feels that way i admire his presidency
7834825 i can understand him wanting to defend his wife and his own record and that is to be expected
7834826 but you can do that in a way that wont engender the kind of feelings that seem to be bubbling up
7834827 i never took a position in the primary even in the south carolina primary i never took a position i made no commitments to anybody
7834828 so if anybody got a problem with that tough this 68 year old could care less about how anybody feels how i conducted myself because i did it in an honorable way and i am proud of it
7834829 i never took a position in the primary even in the south carolina primary i never took a position i made no commitments to anybody
7834830 so if anybody got a problem with that tough this 68 year old could care less about how anybody feels how i conducted myself because i did it in an honorable way and i am proud of it
7834831 you forgot to mention that i warned the people about the british coming
7834832 we were gonna have a cake but the fire marshal said that many candles
7834833 youve got enough of those you need a white one too
7834834 i spent 5 years in a prison cell i didnt have a house
7834835 i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair you know im very proud of cindys father he made the american dream
7834836 this has nothing to do with houses it has to do with putting americans in houses and keeping them in their houses
7834837 the problem for him might be getting a word in edgewise
7834838 you know i m very proud of cindy s father he made the american dream
7834839 i spent 5 years in a prison cell i didnt have a house
7834840 i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair you know im very proud of cindys father he made the american dream
7834841 i come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to its best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7834842 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7834843 and i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate when we begin to write the next great chapter of american progress
7834844 new hope and this is the cause of my life new hope that we will break the old gridlock and guarantee that every american north south east and west young and old will have decent quality affordable healthcare as a fundamental right and not a privilege
7834845 the torch will be passed again to a generation of americans
7834846 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7834847 we are told that barack obama believes too much in an america of high purpose and bold endeavor
7834848 but when john kennedy thought of going to the moon he didnt say its too far to get there we shouldnt even try our people answered his call to rise to the challenge and today an american flag still marks the surface of the moon
7834849 this is what we do we reach the moon we scale the heights i know it ive seen it ive lived it and we can do it again
7834850 he kicked the convention off in a way that passes the torch to a new generation of americans and put it in historical perspective in a way that only he could having been at his brothers side in 1960
7834851 i love him i wish he was running for president
7834852 was a reminder of how good we were and how good we can be once more
7834853 extraordinary record for nearly 50 years of public life of trying to lift others up
7834854 his presence alone is a huge lift to all the people in that hall and for all the people watching
7834855 he knows that his personal imprimatur was a defining moment in the obama campaign
7834856 the theme of this convention is going to be creating a family out of a politically fractured crowd
7834857 if patients want to travel i never tell them to hold off just because they have a tumor or theyre on treatment life is precious
7834858 they are both going to do what they have to do
7834859 there is a lot obama could have done to unify the party and basically he hasnt lifted a finger
7834860 looking out from this podium tonight i see this diverse assembly of democrats as a testament to the strength and unity of our party and the fruition of our 50 state strategy
7834861 i wish he could raise more money that would help us but i have to say his 50 state strategy turned out to be just what we needed
7834862 the problem was not his concept the concept has been vindicated
7834863 it doesnt make sense to pick 30 states and say this is where were going to spend our money you dont know whats going to happen
7834864 i can tell you there are a whole number of congressional seats that are competitive today because howard took a national strategy
7834865 virginia certainly has benefited from his strategy i think he deserves a lot of credit frankly
7834866 has more strength with independent voters than most republicans we as a party can be bummed out about that but weve got to deal with it
7834867 what a party my life among democrats presidents candidates donors activists alligators and other wild animals
7834868 were looking at the largest amount of data and traffic to cross our wireless network of any event to date
7834869 to achieve olympic glory for the motherland is the sacred mission assigned by the communist party central
7834870 you have no control over your own life coaches are with you all the time people are always watching you the doctors even the chefs in the cafeteria you have no choice but to train so as not to let the others down
7834871 i wanted to be a ballet dancer but they said pingpong was right for me
7834872 the sports systems of the united states and china are very accurate metaphors for our societies china is a society run by engineers based on planning and coordination and central planning
7834873 the state is the supreme entity and the role of the individual is to support the state
7834874 truth be told this old soviet system works if you are going to scan the whole population of 1 3 billion for a certain body type and then throw vast resources into training them you will produce champions
7834875 divers who start at an early age before the eye is fully developed have great chance for injuries
7834876 the air force has increased the sheer volume of pilots put through the training pipeline and shipped them off to war with the bare minimum training required
7834877 have come directly from basic training as their first exposure to the professional workforce
7834878 this is stuff we can correct through training stuff that happens between the ears
7834879 flight safety is of paramount importance to the air force and every mishap is carefully studied in order to mitigate future risk
7834880 brooke is de beste stiefmoeder die sam lola en cassandra zich kunnen wensen
7834881 could i just mention to you jay that at a moment of seriousness i spent five and a half years in a prison cell
7834882 i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair and i didnt spend those five and a half years because not because i wanted to get a house when i got out
7834883 given that the root of the problem in financial markets over the past 12 months lies in the ailing us housing market investors still seem concerned that further asset price declines will prolong the malaise as credit write downs continue
7834884 subdued economic prospects and the expectation of additional price hikes continued to depress consumer sentiment
7834885 as slightly positive and the outlook is assessed less critically
7834886 consumers are not interpreting the marked decrease in crude oil prices as an all clear signal when it comes to purchasing power
7834887 looks more to us like a normalisation following a period of exaggerated optimism rather than early signs of a deep and painful recession
7834888 with spain turning down italy struggling and france losing a lot of momentum too a serious german downturn would not bode well for the eurozone as a whole as well to put it mildly
7834889 to cut policy rates in 2009 in reaction to retreating inflation and concurrent evidence of economic weakness
7834890 the bank may also have to explain again the rationale behind its july rate increase
7834891 the boards are pleased to announce that they have reached agreement on the terms of a recommended pre conditional cash offer for the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of imperial energy
7834892 imperial energys directors are pleased to have been able to reach agreement and intend unanimously to recommend that shareholders accept the proposed offer
7834893 we are extremely excited to announce this transaction for our third non core asset atrigel said bob butchofsky qlts president and chief executive officer of qlt
7834894 we have worked diligently towards streamlining the company and believe we are close to reaching this goal
7834895 if the government takes a senior preferred stake it will crystallise existing losses for the banks and add to them in a way that damages local lenders at a time when they can least afford it
7834896 palestine calls to you support me liberate me i am your mother and you are my sons
7834897 i think that officials have every right to be worried
7834898 were always concerned about al qaida and like minded groups
7834899 as you look at these type of events they are a very attractive target
7834900 we just always have to assume that theres someone out there you know looking to come after us looking to come after the people we protect
7834901 today could be the day and you need to be ready
7834902 now that the u s breached the agreed points the north is compelled to take
7834903 its regrettable that this announcement came at a time when each side has been trying
7834904 i hope north korea will resume disablement measures at an early date
7834905 i think this represents the biggest crisis to the denuclearization process since the feb 13 agreement
7834906 the norths kim jong il may have decided that he wont negotiate with the bush administration any more
7834907 to be winners goes beyond medals and records it is about reaching goals for yourself at whatever level and inspiring others

7834910 to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7834911 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to
7834912 see thats just not how he sees the world he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7834913 we know the momentum can shift and its going to shift starting in denver
7834914 now is the time for barack obama to begin the second wave of this campaign
7834915 i think that romney is a fine man and hes always been decent to me but i have a very serious concern and i think the people of massachusetts had about his engagement in the job of governor of massachusetts
7834916 he spent what was it almost 300 days of the last year of his office out of state and it was indicative of how little attention he was paying to us and weve got some serious challenges but lets just see what john mccain does
7834917 economics is not something ive understood as well as i should
7834918 im not up on the economy dont know much about industry really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7834919 and if i could be just like you what a wonderful world this would be
7834920 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7834921 you dont have to know much to understand that barack obamas plans to raise taxes will hurt an already struggling economy and its particularly revealing that the obama campaign feels forced to cast flimsy attack ads during his own convention barack obamas politics of hope is waning
7834922 you remember that line were gonna need a bigger boat
7834923 that is what election officials and administrators are looking at were going to need a bigger boat
7834924 he says it is a shame for him to look into peoples eyes
7834925 he is ashamed that his army has turned into this group of bandits
7834926 we all love georgia and we all feel nervous about this situation
7834927 in this mutual fighting and these mutual victims we feel like we are losing something and of course we feel sad about that
7834928 russia often says they must defend their citizens in georgia
7834929 hes got to kick butt a little more about it
7834930 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
7834931 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
7834932 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
7834933 its not some crazy cycle theory i have it does not fall out of the sky its supply and demand its simple stuff
7834934 how can this be how can it be that they always have 260 billion barrels of oil
7834935 whiskey and gunpowder is brought to you by a team of rebellious brigands exploring commodities politics technology nature history and much more it offers investment ideas and analysis you wont find in the mainstream media
7834936 i oppose the tax because many families in this area are struggling many dont even have incomes
7834937 i think theres other ways our local officials could cut spending not using an increase in taxes as a first resort
7834938 i definitely think itll be a good thing for the county and i think we made the right decision
7834939 there are procedures in place and we will adhere to them the first step in that is to consider the referees report
7834940 west ham united have absolutely no intention of selling craig bellamy he is under contract and is committed to the club craig remains a very important part of our plans for the future
7834941 the club is being run on sound football and business principles in order to develop a squad which can deliver success this season no player would be bought or sold unless that helped to achieve that aim
7834942 we are not interested in selling players who are committed to the club and essential to our first team squad
7834943 if a player refuses to sign a new contract or is not crucial to the managers plans then we will look at offers on a case by case basis it is the only sensible way to build for the future
7834944 we have invested in players this summer identified by the manager who add to the quality of the squad and we will continue to do so as and when appropriate
7834945 without naming names i do want to make the point that the 2003 world cup coaching team effectively left no legacy to the english game
7834946 as a result the elite end of the sport in this country was in a terrible state
7834947 you could argue that the head coachs job is to win the world cup we want martin johnson to win the next world cup so does he
7834948 but if as head coach you divorce yourself from the rest of the business structure which is what happened before and after the 2003 world cup you leave a massive void
7834949 english rugby was like a giant oil tanker going in the wrong direction and beginning to leak i said at my interview that it could take three years to stop the leakage and turn the ship round
7834950 i make no apology for being completely ruthless in my approach over the last two three four years we have witnessed some england performances which were not what you would expect from a group of players representing the biggest union in the world
7834951 english rugby has had its moments of true glory but for consistent results new zealand are always there year in year out we should be there with them
7834952 it would be nonsense to say three years out from the next world cup that we are going to win it but we have the high quality players coming through to know that we will at least go close
7834953 clearly we found there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified them
7834954 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
7834955 i think i need the crowd support a little bit this year
7834956 but i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a us open its a tough tournament to win
7834957 unser ziel f r 2009 ist es das beste delphi und das beste c builder zu liefern das es jemals gab mit unseren neuen produkten k nnen software entwickler sich mit mehr client plattformen datenbanken und besseren benutzerschnittstellen weltweit etablieren als frisch fusioniertes unternehmen haben wir au erdem das ziel die barrieren zwischen anwendungs und datenbank entwicklung zu beseitigen mit den v llig neuartigen architekt editionen von delphi und c builder haben wir diese vision bereits umgesetzt sie kombinieren preisgekr nte datenbank architektur und design features aus er studio mit delphi und c builder was will der entwickler mehr

7834965 i have signed decrees on the recognition by the russian federation of the independence of south ossetia and the independence of abkhazia
7834966 we consider this is a regrettable decision and i recall our attachment to the territorial integrity of georgia
7834967 the current atmosphere reminds me of the situation in europe in 1914 when because of one terrorist leading world powers clashed
7834968 i hope georgian president mikheil saakashvili will not go down in history as a new gavrilo princip
7834969 well yeah i got that point pretty well covered i asked jesus to be my savior and heres one over here that im not too bad on this one but whoa i have some work to do in a few of these other areas i mean do i really exhibit all the fruits of the spirit all the time even when im driving in heavy traffic or when my kid isnt behaving like the ten year old mature adult i think he should be
7834970 i am who i am but god loves me anyway
7834971 well im a ministry leader at my church and as such these are the things i embody
7834972 ive arrived this is me and if i fall short at some time well im not perfect but i am forgiven
7834973 for it is by grace you have been saved through faith and this not from yourselves it is the gift of god not by works so that no one can boast
7834974 for an elder must be a man whose life cannot be spoken against he must be faithful to his wife he must exhibit self control live wisely and have a good reputation he must enjoy having guests in his home and must be able to teach he must not be a heavy drinker or be violent he must be gentle peace loving and not one who loves money he must manage his own family well with children who respect and obey him
7834975 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and self control against such things there is no law
7834976 but grow in the grace and knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ to him be the glory both now and forever
7834977 remember this a farmer who plants only a few seeds will get a small crop but the one who plants generously will get a generous crop
7834978 each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others faithfully administering gods grace in its various forms
7834979 they devoted themselves to the apostles teaching and to the fellowship to the breaking of bread and to prayer everyone was filled with awe and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles all the believers were together and had everything in common selling their possessions and goods they gave to anyone as he had need every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts they broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts praising god and enjoying the favor of all people and the lord added to their number daily those who were being saved
7834980 bring the whole tithe into the storehouse that there may be food in my house test me in this

7834986 i am addicted to coffee and have anywhere between 6 8 cups a day in order to keep myself awake
7834987 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7834988 it has been fully established that between august 7 and 12 georgias armed forces invaded the territory of the unrecognised republic with the aim of fully annihilating the ossetian ethnic group living in south ossetia
7834989 they spared no one we found a woman who had been killed with a shot to the head she was eight months pregnant her unborn child died too
7834990 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7834991 how dangerous such so called frozen conflicts can be given that the georgian leadership as they say went crazy
7834992 were reviewing our entire relationship with russia both for the medium term and the long term
7834993 no question that russia has not lived up to the ceasefire agreement
7834994 the status of those two regions in georgia are not a matter for any one country to decide theyre a matter for the international community through the mechanisms at the united nations

7835015 im not aiming for a lot of high rhetoric im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives
7835016 and so in that sense this is going to be a more workman like speech
7835017 you know 2004 i think was unique nobody knew who i was and i think even up to the time that i walked onto the stage and we had handed out obama signs people were thinking what is this
7835018 i dont think you can duplicate that kind of moment
7835019 i think its fair to say that had it not been for not just for the speech but the movement behind the speech the sentiments behind the speech the work and toil and the risks that were taken by previous generations then i wouldnt be in denver on thursday accepting the nomination for the presidency
7835020 i saw it actually just before i auditioned for the series i rented it so i saw it at home i didnt go out and see it in a theatre
7835021 in some ways it was kind of easier to wrap your head around because when we were doing the series it was like phew its february were going to be going at this full tilt until october its daunting its exhausting so when you have this finite period of time to make this really big movie and take a month its brilliant its a great way to do it

7835075 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7835076 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7835077 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7835078 that was a problem i think 10 to 20 years ago
7835079 i think we were all guilty in not using enough discretion

7835100 we started in advent in 2002 with a petition for compassionate treatment for zahra alawi and her family
7835101 many catholics from around the archdiocese signed the petition and their support was instrumental in convincing senator amanda vanstone to give protection to this family
7835102 many catholics also responded to our appeals for letters of support for a number of the afghan boys who played with the tigers eleven soccer club
7835103 they also wrote letters of support for an ethiopian woman kibre kebede who faced deportation in 2005
7835104 all of these refugees are safe from the persecution and violence they faced in their homeland because in part catholics in brisbane made the effort to support them
7835105 all of the people we supported are australian citizens and are very grateful to the support they received from many good people in brisbane
7835106 some of them have agreed to come to our celebration and to talk about what has happened to them in the last few years
7835107 we encourage people who signed petitions wrote letters of support and helped in other ways to come along and meet some of the people they helped
7835108 we hope that catholics will continue to respond to the gospels call to welcome the stranger
7835109 the fundamental message we want to get across to catholics is that defending and promoting the dignity of our fellow human beings is at the heart of the gospel

7835120 i feel great a lot of my symptoms have gone away the headaches the lightheadedness
7835121 i have more energy and throughout the whole thing i lost 17 pounds
7835122 when you have a lot of toxins in your body it creates a situation where its hard for your body to function the way it should
7835123 people report having more energy and clarity in their thoughts
7835124 the body does a pretty good job of detoxification or cleansing on its own
7835125 people try lots of things to make themselves feel better but many of these diets and supplements are not based in scientific facts
7835126 i got rid of a lot toxins in my body i was happier and more relaxed
7835127 i had a tremendous amount of energy i was regular and no longer bloated
7835128 mood swings bloating gas muscle and joint pains could all indicate you need to detox
7835129 if they had 10 symptoms they have three after the detox
7835130 a lot of the things that were bothering them are not issues anymore
7835131 we just have to stop the import of more toxins the foods and substances to give the body time to catch up
7835132 its quiet right now but once we get the noise going on people will really start to show up

7835138 we could give her medication or we could enter a nutrition program
7835139 its not a diet its a different way of eating of thinking about food
7835140 especially for teens we let them set their own goals and then expect them to commit to them
7835141 this tells us children are not simply outgrowing their baby fat
7835142 now we know a large percentage of chubby kids remain that way
7835143 were not just looking at these kids being on one medication
7835144 these kids will not grow up and move out of your house were creating a whole new culture
7835145 i have seen every single one of these conditions in children under 10
7835146 what people dont realize is that every major organ is affected by obesity
7835147 having an obese parent increases a childs risk for obesity two to three fold

7835159 the dollar continues to be boosted by increased expectations of weaker economic growth in other major developed economies
7835160 it is apparent that euro dollar is becoming more sensitive to downside surprises in eurozone economic data than us negative surprises
7835161 augusts fall in the german ifo business confidence index clearly adds to the recent run of bad news on the eurozones largest economy
7835162 the fall from 97 5 to a three year low of 94 8 was sharper than the consensus forecast but broadly in line with our own expectations
7835163 the decline was due to falls in both business expectations and perceptions of current conditions
7835164 i personally believe the euro is more negatively affected than other currencies by a deepening row between russia and western countries over georgia

7835193 so many of you have been with me in the happiest days and the hardest days together we have known success and seen setbacks victory and defeat
7835194 but we have never lost our belief that we are all called to a better country and a newer world

7835209 it comes down to the debate of what making us whole is
7835210 the city of mobile will continue to guarantee no tax loss to the schools for a full five years after annexation
7835211 i would like to be able to look at it to study it for a while and see what our financial position is going to be when all the different scenarios play out
7835212 its a good faith offer but its too early to sit back and say this is a wonderful thing until we see exactly what were going to lose and what the citys offering to give us back
7835213 this is much much better than before but i dont think weve reached a point of complete trust confidence and recognition
7835214 were making progress toward that so im pleased very pleased but we still have got to do more

7835260 satisfy those of us who criticize obama for his naivet1 2 and cluelessness
7835261 how is bringing a washington insider going to bring about this change
7835262 i admire obama for not having hillary run with him
7835263 as for positives the selection of biden should help obama carry pennsylvania
7835264 biden will bring the ticket both foreign and domestic policy experience which obama so badly lacks
7835265 whether this will satisfy those of us who criticize obama for his naivet1 2 and cluelessness remains to be seen
7835266 his selection shows sen obama to be thoughtful in his decision making process as well as someone who will not just bow to the pressure of what would be best to get him elected
7835267 it just seems so lopsided having so much experience and coming in second just cant make sense of this
7835268 from now on whenever mccain or one of his surrogates talk about foreign policy obama has biden to be the attack dog
7835269 perhaps if joe biden was enough to make this ticket experienced then maybe joe biden should have been the presidential nominee
7835270 this was a wise selection for barack obama but in an area where social issues tend to be to the right even joe biden might not help barack obama
7835271 biden has spoken so favorably of mccain over the years and as recently as when he decided to run stating he would be honored to run with or against mccain for president
7835272 i think its an admission of inexperience by the obama campaign to choose a 35 plus year veteran of the pre change washington
7835273 i had hoped obama was pulling off a surprise that would truly be newsworthy the selection of hillary clinton
7835274 while biden does not exactly reinforce the change message he does counter mccains experience
7835275 how is bringing a washington insider going to bring about this change
7835276 i admire obama for not having hillary run with him
7835277 twenty years ago i wanted to join the peace corps at age 65 i finally did it
7835278 i feel that god has given me such a wonderful life and that its payback time
7835279 there are 116 orphans in my village most of them lost their parents because of aids
7835280 kay is doing something the rest of us at our age would do if we had the courage dedication and stamina
7835281 she can make a big difference for a lot of people sixty thousand dollars wouldhelp a few people in this country but that amount can make a big difference in a lot of lives there
7835282 she should be a model for other peace corps and development workers you cant imagine the logistics and obstacles to build what shes gotten built her involvement stands out beyond the others i know she pulled a community together which is an amazing thing
7835283 an empowered woman with an amazing strength i cant imagine doing what kay is doing
7835284 the peers of our grandchildren they will be solving theworlds problems together
7835285 africa enters your heart its like come back come back
7835286 its a different lifestyle so simple i dont worry about anything except what im doing over there its very much in the moment the people are very loving
7835287 i use it to show people and my kids what children in uhekule bring to school
7835288 i tell them there are needy people in america help them but the ones im trying to help dont have the chances americans do no medicaid food stamps shelters food banks
7835289 i would ask can you adjust to leaving family and friends to a different culture and food and learn a language there are risk factors health care doesnt exist in some of those areas
7835290 life in uhekule brought a peace i never had experienced before
7835291 if women arent in denial they see the marriage is starting to fall apart i saw it happening it wasnt another woman or another man we realized we had nothing in common anymore other than our children and golf
7835292 for a time i was inside myself i knew i had to get out of that and move on i cant spend a lot of time moaning and groaning about things in time i realized this wasnt the end of my life it was the beginning
7835293 when i realized my opportunities i decided to retire and did volunteer work for a while in january 2004 i decided i needed a new life and wanted to get away from minnesota winters i came to hot springs village we had been here before and planned to live here when we both retired
7835294 he came around he said then he knew i was ok my daughter just said mom whatever floats your boat everyones ok with it now
7835295 the kids out of college could pick it up faster but older volunteers like me our retention isnt as good i got better when i got to the village
7835296 my house has two bedrooms a sitting room and off the courtyard a tiny kitchen a bathing room and a toilet
7835297 i use the drainage to water the roses in my garden
7835298 he sent me wonderful care packages hes always there for me
7835299 the people are very social they love to visit it can take five minutes just to greet someone
7835300 the corps wanted us to work at breaking the stigma of hiv and aids
7835301 five days later i heard a hodihodi swahili for may i come in outside my door and there were 10 mamas with buckets of compost on their head that was one of the best days in my life
7835302 i saw isaya a boy who always followed me around town on weekends he was at the bus station selling onions i asked him why he wasnt in school he told me mama died
7835303 it was a spiritual awakening for me it was like a message do something about this thats when the idea of the orphanage came to me i like to think that its a higher power giving me direction
7835304 id also like to get dairy cows or dairy goats into the village
7835305 they gave me a wonderful farewell party and showered me with gifts i couldnt believe the number of people who worked so hard to show their appreciation
7835306 anytime i was carrying something a child or adult would runup and carry it for me the attitude toward elders is different i think were missing the boat in america our older people go into nursing homes not with their families over there they love older people theyve told me we want you back we want your wisdom i was so moved
7835307 i pooh poohed them but when i came back i looked at my house and it looked like a palace i looked in my closet and started to cry i couldnt believe i had so many clothes mike and i went to church one sunday and i started crying i couldnt stop
7835308 i did i just had to talk about how self righteous id become because i think everybody here has too much i couldnt get over how much my grandchildren have when i know so many kids who have nothing i dont want my friends or others to feel guilty this is america the land of plenty but i get uneasy when people talk about how much something costs its a turnoff for me when i know people in my village are hungry and dont have anything
7835309 education is the key for uhekule for tanzania and all of africa
7835310 but its expensive elementary is free but secondary high school is very costly most cant afford it and these children wont have a chance without it
7835311 its unusual were capturing so close together these women who have been gone for three decades
7835312 there has been no coordinated effort against women escapees its a bit strange but we never give up on them our obligation is to carry out the sentence handed down by the court
7835313 he opposes her plan to open up 120 million acres for drilling under kennedy no new oil higher gas prices lost louisiana jobs
7835314 mary landrieu voted to allow illegal immigrants into the social security system
7835315 id rather have a third rate fireman than a first rate arsonist
7835316 the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
7835317 they now support in writing and in legislation a womans right to choose life
7835318 its a sad state of affairs when its news that the democratic party wants mothers to be mothers
7835319 they are terrified of implying that having an abortion is a morally inappropriate choice as long as they are afraid to do that itll be hard for them to make a case that there would be few abortions under a democratic administration
7835320 this idea of a pro choice candidate which was floated by the mccain campaign would be an absolute deal breaker
7835321 exclu de mettre en danger la vie des sauveteurs pour retrouver des corps
7835322 des semaines des mois voire des ann es apr s leur disparition
7835323 i have more time to see patients than other doctors
7835324 i can talk to people and they like the attention a lot of times ill make a diagnosis that someone else might miss only because im doing the analysis of the patient and listening to what their story is
7835325 im using labs that i like to use because i find that the person looking at the specimens is reliable
7835326 if i do a biopsy it is very important to have the pathologist who reads the biopsy be an expert if he tells me that something is malignant or benign i can believe him
7835327 they spend more for their dogs when they go to see the vet than when they see me
7835328 this is the kind of care that people were used to before all this changed i think they are willing to pay a little more to have someone spend the time with them
7835329 when you terminate the plan you will lose some of the patients who are shopping by price
7835330 but not everyone shops by price many people will come in and see you and know that they are getting the attention that they need and the time that they want
7835331 the worst thing that could happen is that it fails and you have to go into managed care
7835332 in all of my years i was never in the red even when i started way back when and i just hung my shingle i was able to meet my expenses and have some profits besides
7835333 it was getting so bad that mom was directing him
7835334 i said if dad doesnt stop driving im going to call the state troopers and report him because i didnt want to see him kill someone
7835335 the driving conversation is often the beginning of many conversations
7835336 i think driving impairment does not happen suddenly its usually a gradual decline
7835337 we want to be on our own for as long as possible and the driving conversation is the tip of the iceberg
7835338 in america we are a culture on the move driving is something we see as an entitlement
7835339 i could still drive but i dont opt to i guess
7835340 its so nice i dont have to park i just get out of the car and come in its much better
7835341 it got to the point where he shouldnt drive anymore and he was determined to drive
7835342 so we had the state retest him and he failed it
7835343 pretty much almost everyone at some point will have to hand in their keys
7835344 if you plan ahead of time its usually not as devastating as people think it is
7835345 i think it gives them more things to assist them so that they can be on the road longer and safer
7835346 they know when they no longer can drive in bad weather or at night
7835347 many people have been driving for so many years that a lot has changed since the time they were first licensed

7835350 bebo has a very strong offering that caters to a very desirable youth market and this elusive audience appeals to itn
7835351 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7835352 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7835353 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7835354 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
7835355 in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
7835356 hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital 10 years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
7835357 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7835358 this was unexpected and will drive up the sale price
7835359 one of the staff was shot to show others that they actually meant business the robbers collected all the money that were on the counter while others that were still in possession of the customers were also taken away from them the robbers actually gained entrance into the bank by pretending to be one of the earlier morning customers two of them who stood outside were armed with rifles they waited outside while the others went into the banking hall

7835366 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion

7835384 as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
7835385 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose

7835387 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended tocreate a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder
7835388 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
7835389 we need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins when those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine philosophy and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus the judiciary at this point in the development of mans knowledge is not in a position
7835390 they put a limit on the creature painting not being able to paint creatures parts due to shading errors with the animation of creatures they did not look right

7835392 while americans are becoming more and more educated in terms of their time spent in school and their education level accomplished
7835393 they are decreasing in terms of literate behaviors this is particularly obvious in our lack of support of bookstores and the constantly diminishing circulation of newspapers
7835394 not a single city in our survey has more independent bookstores now than five years ago
7835395 fifty seven out of 60 cities reported fewer retail booksellers in 2007 than in 2003 in several the number of booksellers per capita dropped by half of what was reported in 2003

7835417 north korea is trying to muddle through and delay as much as possible
7835418 at the same time this is a last ditch effort trying to somehow influence u s presidential politics
7835419 i think the timing of the hu jintao visit to south korea was very depressing to the north koreans
7835420 i see it as another card at the negotiation table to urge the u s to remove it from the terrorism blacklist as soon as possible
7835421 the united states and china can think that they are drawing north korea into true nuclear disarmament but north korea has continued to nuclearise throughout the six party process
7835422 such action by north korea will surely hurt foreign investor sentiment towards south korean shares even further i expect foreign exchange markets in particular to be vulnerable to the news
7835423 we know it wont always be smooth sailing the more difficult the circumstances the more we must remember the important commitments made by each party and abide by a spirit of mutual respect in encouraging mutual confidence

7835440 i keep everything open if they have a suggestion they can put in but i always preface it with if i dont like it ive got 51 percent of the vote but dont be afraid to put it out there and dont continue to let it hang if i dont like it just drop it and we move on youll come up with another great idea later
7835441 i go from the small to the large the part to the whole
7835442 the individual meeting with the coordinators maybe two or three guys then to the whole group the offense defense special teams then everybody together you feel like youre going from one meeting to another at times but thats good it keeps people organized and on the same page
7835443 the players know that if he has to fly over to taiwan to get something made he doesnt care hell do it if he has to bring in a nike guy to get the shoes right custom shoes or whatever hell get it done
7835444 the players have to know the equipment guy is doing everything possible to put them in a good position so they can go out and play 100 m p h
7835445 it starts with your owner for both of those guys equipment manager and trainer from the day we got here our owner said we want it first class and we want it done the right way and that allows those guys to do that they dont shortchange anything so they can go out and get the best equipment for them thats a huge thing
7835446 if you get in here by about 8 in the morning you can be out of here by noon and the rest of the day is yours
7835447 sometimes i do appearances but if im not really doing anything ill do whatever errands i have to do because you really dont have much time to do them the rest of the week
7835448 i try to be a handyman but usually ill make things worse then ill call the plumber something like that but for the most part im just watching sports on television
7835449 i look for what they like to do on first second and third down ill just put the tape in and look at all first down passes first and second down runs third down nickel stuff
7835450 everything has to be done for the players by tuesday night
7835451 they all get a book of the game plan it shows the opponents pass plays and runs its a pretty good sized book and it takes a little time to put that together meantime the offensive coaches are off doing their own thing
7835452 we could go until about 11 oclock its like getting ready for a final exam every week you want to have as much knowledge as you can so we try to get everything fed to the players on wednesday
7835453 it all depends what works for you like just talking on the phone with your loved ones or like just paying bills thatll get your mind off it
7835454 i dont have a lot of physical demands in this game but the mental part wears on you
7835455 my wife says im like a woman with pms the last two months of the season it kind of builds up as the year goes on so i need those stress release days to not think about stuff it kind of builds back up wednesday thursday friday and saturday then im pretty revved up on sunday so on tuesday i try not to come in at all if possible i dont have to watch film
7835456 we might go to chuck e cheese or swim in the pool
7835457 my son races quarter midgets miniature racing cars and i do racing on the computer i do friday nights at atco raceway my daughters getting in the band its just a lot of fun seeing them do things and it makes you realize honestly that football is a job but its not your life
7835458 i think its easier said than done especially if youve had a bad game or you lost
7835459 when that happens you find yourself sitting around thinking about the plays you could have made thats why its important that by this point youve learned to have a short memory
7835460 its a chance to get your heart and your head at 100 percent
7835461 most nfl coaches put in long hours and tuesday is probably the busiest day the toughest day

7835476 this is a wonderful message about the rensselaer education and the impact it has on alumni long after theyve graduated from rensselaer

7835510 our forces are doing their best to prevent these incidents by and large they are able to control the situation our forces are ready to meet any challenges in the border so there is no cause for worry
7835511 you know very well the situation both in the valley and in jammu it is a matter of concern to us in the rest of the country there can be political debates but in j k we are playing with the security of the nation therefore we have to keep restraint
7835512 the government is making all out effort to bring normalcy in the state the task at hand is difficult i do not want to say anything more now already the government stand is very clear

7835528 we can see our districts are making headway and are on a trajectory to proficiency
7835529 i think the no 1 thing is our administration does a very good job with discipline once you have students disciplined then your kids can learn
7835530 we were so happy with that just the progress that we didnt expect value added to help
7835531 all this hard work is paying off it all goes back to the teacher you have to inspire the students and i think our teachers are doing that
7835532 ive been trying to learn a little more about our value added measure
7835533 my teachers really worked hard and showed improvement i think thats where value added comes in
7835534 i like the value added because its an additional measure i think really targets students of all levels even though students arent proficient theyre showing growth
7835535 i would attribute success to a staff that is focused on the academic standards and the strategies they use to get those across to students
7835536 and to the parents and students for making education important
7835537 i think we have aligned our curriculum to the standards and that is what were emphasizing
7835538 i think for us it starts back in the elementary and even though the middle school didnt reach excellent it went from effective to continuous improvement there are building blocks there
7835539 were still weak in a lot of indicators we wont be happy until we make 30 indicators and maintain 30
7835540 when i see our county doing well it excites me theres no such thing that our kids cant learn like the rest of the kids in the state
7835541 while ive been going on the blood from my wrist has travelled to my heart and my fingers touch this soft blue paper notebook control a pencil that shifts up and sideways mapping my thinking going its own way
7835542 once we have that design well make it available to the public
7835543 while home sales activity has been less than robust throughout the year due to difficult economic conditions and tightening credit ohios real estate professionals remain optimistic that a turnaround to the states housing market is not too far off
7835544 weve continually reached sales levels that are within the range of what the buckeye state traditionally experienced prior to the run up that started in 2003
7835545 its not going to be short and swift but its begun nonetheless
7835546 my husband always said if that plant catches fire you grab your purse and you go
7835547 we knew there was no way to contain the fire and our first purpose would be to protect the exposures of homes and businesses to the south and the homes to the north
7835548 we put a lot of work into the landscaping and my husband and i were married there
7835549 were just so thankful for the firefighters who helped save our home
7835550 both my kids were born here and its upsetting to me but im really just worried about what my tenants are going to do
7835551 my insurance company thinks they can save the house but its in rough shape
7835552 he got some medicine from the vet this morning but hes doing that coughing thing
7835553 ive always thought that thing was a tinderbox if it caught i knew it was going to burn like that
7835554 it is an older structure so we are testing for asbestos
7835555 that continues to present a challenge in our district as far as our subgroups
7835556 we initially had three subgroups that did not meet ayp but because of the growth model african american and socioeconomic subgroups met ayp otherwise we would have been continuous improvement as a district
7835557 the subgroup used to be a higher number which made it that much tougher last year the high school had no subgroups and this year there are subgroups all over the place
7835558 if its affecting everybody then i dont worry as much
7835559 we need to continue to work with our subgroups so they meet the standards
7835560 thus far the economically disadvantaged subgroup has met the standard but its not as far as the other students
7835561 we have some kids who really want to go beyond what their iep individual education plant says its so neat to see
7835562 we eliminated a lot of kids because they werent eligible hopefully well be able to do that again this year
7835563 it will help districts because obviously these are hurting the districts its a tough subgroup the teachers do work very hard with them
7835564 overall we did do better than we did were showing growth if we continue to do that good i think it shows staff is trying to improve every student
7835565 we are certainly proud that our inmate groups were willing to donate to the back to school blast
7835566 it shows that these inmates are willing to contribute back to society and at the same time preparing themselves for a successful reentry into the community
7835567 we have a problem growing it in the midwest some of this research money could go towards identifying varieties for the user
7835568 at the request of the georgian government these ships will be delivering humanitarian aid to poti
7835569 the uss mcfaul and another u s ship will dock in poti in wednesday
7835570 if you look at the rtsi futures they dropped about 25 points on the news russia had recognized abkhazia and south ossetia i think what investors have been hoping in the last couple of weeks is for the government to take active steps to minimize the conflict and the recognition of these two entities is clearly a step in the wrong direction from the stock markets point of view
7835571 this is a symptom of the poor sentiment toward russia on the international public level on the domestic political level and oil prices are at a new low in recent days and weeks it is very hard to see any positives for the russian market at the current time
7835572 however every single stock on micex at this point is in the red and well in the red you are seeing a host of technical indicators that are telling you this market is grossly oversold it is hard for me to see how the news gets worse unless oil dips below 105
7835573 its not particularly surprising until the u s presidential elections at the very least were going to have more noise and tension
7835574 the two key factors are oil price and risk the higher the tensions the more investors will take issue
7835575 this type of political noise doesnt tend to last unless of course it escalates into something further
7835576 our default view would still be that this noise is likely to last until the end of the year but its not going to last for ever ultimately russia could do as much damage to the west as the west could seek to inflict on russia
7835577 its likely that in the medium term wiser heads will prevail
7835578 we cant see the market going up much this year and we cant see the catalyst but the value is clearly there
7835579 there are georgian forces on one side ossetians on the other
7835580 is this a normal life we are afraid our children will be killed
7835581 the only thing we want is peace i dont care who we are with russia or georgia people are dying
7835582 they are trying to force out the ossetian population it is our territory
7835583 our position is not to get involved in any kind of provocation
7835584 the russians told us yesterday that if something happens in this area they will bomb georgia again
7835585 would buy preferred stock subject to significant treasury participation and an attractive yield
7835586 would add confidence that the securities would hold their value

7835589 supremacy was a political doctrine grounded politically on racist beliefs but also reflecting a particular view of political power and the states obligations rather than being a simple reflection of racist attitudes supremacy was emerging in these years as a system for the organization and articulation of governance

7835616 my personal view is that a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in this is very much a personal view at this stage
7835617 we cannot simply sit on our hands as some would have us do and keep saying that no means no

7835632 do you identify christ as the head of your body and live like he is the brains of your operation does your life reflect the supernatural connection you have to the rest of his body are you living in community with your brothers and sisters in his body or in isolation from other believers does your relationship with the church show that you believe that you are members of one another or do you disobey pauls instructions by living as if you dont need the other members it is not enough to have a head knowledge of these doctrines we must examine ourselves daily to see if we live out these teachings if not we must take our thoughts captive and make them submit to the truth of gods word

7835758 the consumer climate was depressed further by the very subdued economic outlook even significantly lower crude oil prices did nothing to brighten the consumer mood
7835759 consumers are not interpreting the marked decrease in crude oil prices as an all clear signal when it comes to purchasing power
7835760 the german economy is encountering an increasingly more difficult situation
7835761 the german consumer is clearly no match for the rapid slowdown of the global economy

7835818 the fall from 97 5 to a three year low of 94 8 was sharper than the consensus forecast but broadly in line with our own expectations
7835819 the decline was due to falls in both business expectations and perceptions of current conditions

7835892 for months while mccains presidential campaign was gearing up scheunemann held dual roles advising the candidate on foreign policy while working as georgias lobbyist between january 1 2007 and may 15 2008 the campaign paid scheunemann nearly 70 000 to provide foreign policy advice during the same period the government of georgia paid his firm 290 000 in lobbying fees
7835893 give them logistical support to assist spokespeople with handling the european media
7835894 finally finally russia has acknowledged that we exist and that we have suffered
7835895 i think after russia we will be recognized by for example belgrade for example china and maybe syria and also belarus
7835896 everything saakashvili does is organized by your country and every child here knows this
7835897 western taxpayers should think where their taxes go we are killed by western weapons
7835898 mr kudukov 72 said that he had quit drinking 18 years ago but that he would celebrate monday night
7835899 i will pour a glass to say long live our freedom
7835900 they have no economy whatsoever and they never had any economy
7835901 there is no way it can be a viable entity
7835902 if it were independent it would be a poor rural place its very hard to talk about ossetian independence from russia with a straight face
7835903 i dont think anybody really cares a lot about the south ossetian people
7835904 al pasar las p ginas se subraya el paso del tiempo porque tienes ese positivo y ese negativo

7835907 como en una profunda contemplaci n lo que encaja perfectamente con un emperador que era m s un fil sofo que un soldado
7835908 todos estamos seguros de que la afici n estar con nosotros s lo les quiero decir que nos anime desde el primer minuto porque forman parte del equipo su apoyo nos va a venir bien para lograr nuestro objetivo los aficionados tienen que estar tranquilos y confiados porque el pr ximo jueves seremos oficialmente equipo de liga de campeones
7835909 estamos a un paso de lograr lo que nos propusimos la temporada pasada el atl tico de madrid tiene que seguir creciendo y dar este paso hacia la champions ser a muy importante para todos una vez que estemos en la fase de grupos el atl tico se ver las caras con los mejores el lugar que debe ocupar si ganamos nos vamos a ganar el respeto de todos
7835910 sabemos que llevamos un marcador en contra pero se puede remontar para vencer tenemos que estar tranquilos si jugamos el f tbol que nos gusta en el vicente calder n podemos pasar tranquilamente todos estamos muy comprometidos
7835911 marcar ser a muy lindo porque es un partido muy importante lo fundamental es que ganemos y da igual quien marque en el equipo hay gente muy ofensiva y ellos tienen que tener cuidado porque cualquier jugador puede meter un gol ojal el mi rcoles se puedan ver muchos goles que nos lleven a pasar la eliminatoria en casa
7835912 estoy muy feliz ten amos un grupo muy bueno muy compacto y al final conseguir el oro ha sido lo m ximo ganar unos juegos ol mpicos siempre es algo especial lo dicen todos los deportistas y es cierto
7835913 todo este tiempo que he pasado en pek n me ha servido para agarrar la forma me encuentro bien y listo para jugar el partido frente al schalke me ha dado tiempo a descansar y habituarme al ritmo del equipo
7835914 whats the point ive already achieved greatness in the greatest basketball league in the world
7835915 it is still a great job to this day and tristar is a great company to work for
7835916 it is rewarding to still drive past houses you have worked on years ago and the ones you work on now the tenants are great too in most of the estates there is always someone who remembers you and invites you in for a cuppa
7835917 its really nice to be acknowledged by the company for all our work and receive this gift i shall be taking the whole family out for a really nice meal to celebrate
7835918 i still really enjoy coming to work every day in 40 years has been different and i have met and worked with some of the best people i could hope to meet
7835919 its great to be acknowledged for your hard work but its been such a great place to work that i will probably be here for a good few more years yet
7835920 at tristar we really value our staff and have many long standing employees
7835921 it makes us all proud to have so many staff that have stayed with us for so long and continuously show their commitment dedication and hard work for the company and to our customers we recognise and acknowledge this by giving something back to them
7835922 the public purse should not just be used to mop up the problems caused by banking difficulties the government should recognise that councils are well placed to take a judicious share of mortgage business an opportunity that could yield a surplus for the council tax payer
7835923 in 1980 600 000 mortgages with homeowners were held by local authorities since then the banking industry has almost universally taken on this role
7835924 today we need a more balanced approach involving both private and public sectors offering mortgage finance
7835925 what they are talking about doing is helping out these customers in difficulties so they are really aiming at the higher credit risk end of the market i do not know how experienced these councils are at mortgage lending
7835926 there is a regulatory requirement to fulfil but more importantly it is around making sure the councils understand the risk they are writing
7835927 you need experienced people to do this and ensure the systems and processes are in place to be able to write business effectively
7835928 i would caution councils it is interesting but they will be taking on risk they might not be able to understand as well as existing lenders

7835930 found that a majority of americans sympathized with chicago police
7835931 intent on expressing by peaceful means their dissent either from the society generally or from the administrations policies in vietnam
7835932 its not enough to want to know the truth you must know where to look for it and the truth is elusive because it knows where to hide
7835933 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7835934 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7835935 madonna felt as if she has been living in a siege situation the noise of the drilling meant she was forced to listen to her ipod at full volume potentially damaging her ears
7835936 i kind of wish he wasnt a minority but its good enough
7835937 yeah i think its too bad but people worry after this interview that we might end up with a mentally handicapped president this year
7835938 but i think people forget that weve had a retarded president since 2001 oh wait i guess theyre right to worry
7835939 weve got a pretty big country they could be just about anywhere
7835940 i believe that in this case it sure would seem to me that the most critical thing to do would have been to inform the public at first time in the morning to ensure that people were aware of this
7835941 we have to always ensure peoples rights are protected so that we do want to make sure we have the right people missing
7835942 whatever she is is drinking give her another one and tell her it is on me
7835943 both the northern ireland minister and scottish ministers recognise how vital the ferry link through loch ryan is to our economies
7835944 mr murphy is clearly supportive of the need for further road improvements on the scottish side of the routes to get maximum benefit of the spend on northern irelands infrastructure
7835945 we recognise that there are planning and other processes to go through
7835946 but there is no doubt that the minister is determined that this project goes ahead with all possible speed
7835947 with the ongoing works to both the westlink and the m2 between sandyknowes and greencastle larnes connections to the road network across the island of ireland continue to improve
7835948 completion of the a8 dualling will bring the irish eastern seaboard key transport corridor up to the standard deserving of trans european route status
7835949 the purpose of this initiative is to raise awareness amongst hgv drivers of what they can do to help us make northern ireland a safer place for them and their families in 2006 nearly 800 000 commercial vehicles used the ports of larne and belfast
7835950 in terms of smuggling loads some drivers will be paid for what they do some will be doing it under duress and there will be some who are unaware of what is in their load
7835951 commercial drivers are themselves a community and like any community they will know what is going on and we need their help to reduce the harm that smuggling is causing northern ireland

7835979 if senator obama cannot answer the most basic question of when life and human rights begin he has no business embracing a pro choice position or for that matter speaking out on the issue of abortion at all
7835980 if elected senator obama would become the abortion president with the most extremist policies on abortion of any president in american history the christian defense coalition will be working diligently over the next several months to educate faith voters on mr obamas extremist abortion views this is not a candidate who is concerned about social justice hope and equality rather this is a candidate that will continue the violence and pain of abortion and refuse to end this tragic war against americas women and children
7835981 as a 23 year old woman of faith i am appalled at the radical and troubling abortion politics of senator obama the website will educate my generation on where senator obama stands on the issue of abortion
7835982 this is not a progressive view on abortion or one that affirms women as most of this emerging generation is embracing a culture of life and growing less comfortable with abortion senator obama wants to take us back to a radical pro abortion posture that is both archaic and disturbing

7836039 this is my homage to one of the most underrated filmmakers of the country when i met mr samanta he was so pleased to know his films would reach out to a new generation howrah bridge is one of my favourite noire films the magic of sachin dev burmans music the chemistry between ashok kumar and madhubala and the seductive charm of ashok kumars baritone all that i want to capture in animation form
7836040 ive chosen howrah bridge amar prem and barsaat ki ek raat because they not only represent three phases in shakti samantas career but also three generations of superstars ashok kumar rajesh khanna and amitabh bachchan barsaat is not one of mr bachchans better known films so theres an added excitement there of introducing a neglected ab film through animation
7836041 well have the original music from these films but well also have re mix version of the originals side by side

7836093 sempre senza pensare senza unopinione propria una volta gridando osanna e laltra a morte a morte
7836094 teniendo en cuenta la libre expresi n de la voluntad de los pueblos oseta y abjaso he firmado los decretos sobre el reconocimiento por la federaci n de rusia de la independencia de osetia del sur y de la independencia de abjasia
7836095 no ha sido una opci n f cil pero es la nica posibilidad de garantizar la vida de la gente
7836096 the idea that polarization works is so na ve that it drives me mad we need more complicated models of understanding such as zones of contact
7836097 you might think i have been crude all along now im going to be really crude
7836098 i have never had someone inspire me the way people tell me my father inspired them but i do now and i know someone else whos been inspired all over again by senator obama
7836099 in our family hell always be known as uncle teddy more than any senator of his generation or perhaps any generation teddy has made life better for people in this country and around the world for 46 years he has been so much more than just a senator for the people of massachusetts hes been a senator for all who believe in a dream thats never died
7836100 this is not an easy choice but this is the only chance to save peoples lives
7836101 georgia chose the least human way to achieve its goal to absorb south ossetia by eliminating a whole nation
7836102 they did great for nigeria the dream team iv players were not intimidated playing mighty argentina in the final they truly deserved the gold not the silver
7836103 these boys are the future of nigerias football i am happy that majority of them are already commanding shirts in the super eagles
7836104 as you already know there are no push over or minnows in african football any more that is why we must do everything to get it right for the next world cup
7836105 its very easy when you ride horses as good as this hes equally at home on good or soft ground
7836106 i still feel it was a deliberate attempt by johnny to keep me pocketed i was extremely unhappy about it at the time
7836107 i cant think about a more obvious case of team tactics while aidan obrien is regularly quoted that pacemakers are there to make sure there is a good and even pace red rock canyon went far beyond that in the juddmonte
7836108 the british horse racing authority needs to let coolmore and other yards that use pace makers know that team tactics like this are not acceptable it has left a bitter taste in the mouth
7836109 racing is not a team game but this was a team effort to get duke of marmalade to win if odonoghue had looked behind him and seen another horse rather than duke of marmalade would he have been so accommodating
7836110 there were no tactics and the best horse won some people should stop making an issue about something there is nothing to make an issue about
7836111 shell be on the easy list for the next 10 days just walking but then well start getting her in peak condition for the prix de labbaye in paris in six weeks time
7836112 i would like to make it clear that springbok coach peter de villiers his management team and playing squad have my unequivocal backing and that of sarus presidents council and of the board of sa rugby
7836113 although we share and understand the frustration and disappointment of supporters speculation about the coachs future is pointless
7836114 let me put an end to speculation that the post tri nations review will in some way be pivotal to the future of the coach
7836115 that is not the case it is an entirely normal quarterly review such as every springbok coach has undergone i would like to underline that peters future is secure
7836116 we are not in the business of sacking springbok coaches within three months of them playing their first match
7836117 it is fair that the blame lies with the coach
7836118 if a company closes the md is held responsible so it is right but we had a good video session today and there were some harsh words exchanged but i am willing to accept the blame in the best interests of the team we know our backs are against the wall and the players know they are under pressure
7836119 a member of the taekwondo family a senior black belt a promoter of taekwondo in nigeria and the father of the short changed player in this disputed contest chika chukwumerije
7836120 the officiating was so flawed that the victor was robbed of victory and the defeated awarded an unmerited victory
7836121 in accordance with the rules chikas coach and the nigerian taekwondo leadership filed a protest to the taekwondo supervisory board against the poor officiating
7836122 to underline the seriousness of nigerias concern for the stultifying effect of this level of refereeing on the future of taekwondo the top management of nigerias olympic sports organization comprising chief engineer gumel chairman of nigeria olympic committee banji oladapo secretary general of the committee alhaji bappa the assistant secretary general patrick ekeji the director of sports development in nigeria nathaniel nnaji vice chairman nigeria taekwondo federation and my humble self met the chairman of africa taekwondo union general fouli of egypt and re emphasised our protest
7836123 we were told that the protest would be considered and a review was underway the next shock which hit us was a display on the television screen announcing a tournament for a third position and listing chika chukwumerije as a contestant
7836124 this meant that our protest received merely a nominal nod but was never treated unlike the protest by britain in an earlier bout
7836125 by fair officiating this tournament should have ended 3 0 in favour of chika chukwumerije the calculation is thus the three points given to alexandro were unmerited gifts and therefore a nullity
7836126 on the other hand chikas three 3 points that is the two 2 points acknowledged by the referees and the one 1 point denied by referees were clearly earned
7836127 an unprecedented number of stoppages of the fight for consultations among the referees took place in this tournament
7836128 on three occasions the referees stopped the fight and consulted among themselves thereby giving a strong impression that they were unsure of their readings of the contest
7836129 like other taekwondo countries nigeria is bound to be demoralized nigerias only protection and assurance in the sport of taekwondo is the hope that taekwondo convention offers a level playing ground in competitions this hope has now been severely undermined
7836130 two the international image of taekwondo may be soiled and its standing in the comity of world sports lowered by a growing impression of subjective and unpredictable commitment of our referees to the rules of the game
7836131 three the insensitivity of the taekwondo supervisory board to genuine protests against provable acts of poor officiating in accordance with the rules encourages anti compliance behaviour among practitioners
7836132 in an earlier bout womens under 57kg quarter finals the british coach angrily shot up from his seat like thunder bolt and protested in a loud voice against a case of poor officiating he aggressively followed up after the contest with a strong protest to the board
7836133 how can i say it at the end of the year youve got the wheelbarrow out
7836134 we are not our parents and we never will be
7836135 encontrar al responsable de los fallos para que reciba el castigo oportuno
7836136 el tour de este a o ser la vuelta a espa a
7836137 nuestro juego esta vez ser much simo much simo mejor de eso estoy seguro
7836138 no hemos concedido ning n gol fuera de casa y esperamos que las cosas sean diferentes por el hecho de jugar la segunda vuelta en anfield
7836139 se puede ver que el equipo ahora empieza a verse m s fuerte y el t cnico cuenta con much simas m s opciones
7836140 ser muy dif cil pero no tenemos nada que perder en la ida dominamos claramente el partido y merecimos ganar saldremos en el terreno de anfield con la intenci n de dar la sorpresa
7836141 i continue to be available all hours of the day and night
7836142 this is a very important convention where there is a chance that the next president of the united states will be nominated
7836143 his absence is yet another example of a harper minister missing in action at the height of a national medical crisis
7836144 to not be on the file and to not be visible and ever present throughout this whole crisis is dereliction of duty
7836145 i just find this totally reprehensible and unacceptable its an abysmal lack of leadership
7836146 we at canadians for accountability a group founded to promote accountability and support whistleblowers were shocked and offended many of us are whistleblowers ourselves
7836147 an informant is not a whistleblower and we dont care to be grouped with them
7836148 some people have likened him to a whistleblower i dismiss that
7836149 the whistleblower was the gentleman who turned mr pomerleau in
7836150 but weve agreed to revise it and repost it the questionnaire drew the ire of lisa lee a bull shoals parent of two flippin middle school eighth grade boys thursday
7836151 he filled it out at home while i was cooking thursday night
7836152 i looked at it and i got furious lee objects to eight questions that ask whether students believe in god whether they pray about problems whether they say grace before meals whether they regularly read the bible and other spiritual questions
7836153 thats religious profiling its geared toward christianity students will score higher if they believe in christianity
7836154 what if youre a buddhist what if youre an atheist does that mean youre not going to be as successful
7836155 means you dont have a very good perspective of the world around you and you need an attitude adjustment for your own good well being
7836156 we were unaware the document existed until it was brought to our attention davidson said in the statement that his department refers teachers to the arkansas career orientation teachers association web site www arcota org
7836157 we are currently reviewing all information on the associations web site flippin school district superintendent dale query met with lee on monday morning and agreed to discontinue use of the test in his school
7836158 i think its been taken out of context the way students believe does affect their futures
7836159 we will put a revised version on our web site and if people want to continue using it they can

7836168 news exists in many forms and theres more of it than ever before
7836169 every executive has to be aware that this is not something they can hide the smallest mouth hiding under the smallest rock can be found and someone will shine a light there
7836170 a big problem i had with paul was i wanted him to get on television get in print and tell the public what would happen
7836171 they didnt just go into the bunker they said we are aware that there is a problem and basically they did not take half measures
7836172 get it out there apologize tell people what youre doing to fix it and then move on doing what you say youd do

7836177 usage based policies that allow you to buy car insurance based on how much you actually drive
7836178 this could save you up to 60 percent on your insurance
7836179 fees are usually charged when you divide your annual premium payment into installments rather than pay for a year of coverage all at once it can be as little as a few dollars per payment but the more you break it down the more it adds up when you apply for the policy ask what the fees are for paying in installments if you can pay your annual premium all at once
7836180 listeriosis is a bacterial infection caused by a gram positive motile bacterium listeria monocytogenes
7836181 was confirmed as being involved in the outbreak of the food borne illness caused by the bacterium listeria monocytogenes
7836182 on monday maple leaf upgraded a precautionary recall of 23 of its products issued last week to all 220 packaged meats from the plant
7836183 but we commit to you that maple leaf foods exceeds federal food safety standards and that our management of the listeria outbreak will be motivated by one thing only the best public health interests of canadians and specifically our customers
7836184 symptoms of listeriosis which include high fever severe headache neck stiffness and nausea occur up to 70 days after consuming contaminated food though the average incubation period is 30 days
7836185 how come all im hearing about is the 20 million cost to maple leaf foods and about the stock crash
7836186 im sure the families of the people who died are not concerned about maple leaf foods downfall by the time this is all done the families should sue and maple leaf foods should close for good i know im not eating any more products from maple leaf it used to be my kids favorite brand but the trust in a safe product is gone
7836187 laughter is the elixir of life you either laugh or cry and i like to laugh until the tears run down my face
7836188 dad do you think she will remember we are here
7836189 it means diabetic wounds can be actually healed rather than just offering palliative care it could mean fewer amputations which are often necessary when these wounds wont heal
7836190 the cost of non healing wounds would be up in the hundreds of millions of dollars
7836191 a lot of wound care is done in the community and this dressing doesnt need changing as often as conventional dressings so it could save on time and travel costs
7836192 the gel sheet developed by dr molan is a unique patented system for holding medihoney antibacterial honey in contact with a wound while at the same time absorbing what the wound exudes
7836193 absorbency and antibacterial activity are two of the key benefits wound care clinicians look for when evaluating wound dressings
7836194 when there are lots of competing males trying to fertilise the eggs of females males produce larger more competitive sperm that live for longer
7836195 similarly when females detect that there are too many males competing for her eggs too many sperm can kill the eggs of some organisms the females play hard to get producing smaller eggs that are harder for searching sperm to find
7836196 these changes make sense if youre stuck to a rock like sea squirts are
7836197 if you cant run away from a highly competitive environment you must therefore make your gametes more competitive in order to get a higher chance of successfully reproducing
7836198 we manipulated adult densities in the field by placing either one low density or 15 high density sea squirts in a cage for one month
7836199 this research tells us a little as to how sex evolved in the first place
7836200 specifically it gives us some insight into why sperm are so tiny and males make millions of them whereas female eggs are much larger and are produced in fewer numbers
7836201 because these organisms reproduce by the ancestral mode of reproduction it gives us an indication as to how competition between males led to all sorts of reproductive strategies including the one used by humans internal fertilisation
7836202 the benefits of the program accrued very quickly and are very large
7836203 when adults stop smoking you see immediate benefits in heart disease with impacts on cancer and lung diseases starting to appear a year or two later
7836204 we confirmed these results with a wide range of model reliability tests and sensitivity analyses to make sure that the findings we found were not a result of some unobserved third factor
7836205 for example including differences between california and the control states on a variety of risk factors did not materially affect the results
7836206 the methods in this study can be used to forecast future costs and will provide important additional means for validating program evaluations that previously did not exist

7836233 ya kehidupan saya sejak kecil memang tidak lepas dari dunia seni jadi sejak kecil saya sudah tertarik pada dunia seni meskipun menjadi penari jawa tidak pernah saya bayangkan sebelumnya
7836234 saya jelas orang jepang tapi hati saya sering menjerit jika mendengar atau melihat pentas tari jawa sepi penonton saya sering menangis jika melihat pentas tari jawa dipadatkan dengan berbagai alasan pentas tari jawa itu harus utuh supaya penonton bukan hanya melihat tarian tapi juga meresapi dan memahami makna dari sebuah tarian
7836235 saat itu keuangan saya pas pasan tidak ada sponsor untung sekali saya bertemu mas bondan winarno yang tanpa banyak berkata memberi saya dana untuk pementasan di ikj saya senang akhirnya bisa mementaskan tari itu secara utuh selama sekitar 70 menit bersama teman teman dari solo

7836303 we are looking for more downside in copper towards 7 000 u s per tonne very short term until we see any signs of a pick up particularly in chinese import buying

7836305 renewed buying is now expected to draw stocks into china particularly for copper copper concentrates iron ore ferrochrome and coal
7836306 while the equity markets are currently focused on downside risks we believe there are potential offsets on the upside based on continued strength in commodity demand low inventory levels and a supply side which continues to face multiple constraints
7836307 eight weeks ago sen barack obama was on top in all three of these key swing states and that would make his election almost a sure thing times have changed and the election is now very much a tossup in these states sen obama needs this convention to give his campaign a jump start
7836308 whether this reflects obamas weakness or mccains strength the effect has been to make a close race out of a campaign many initially expected to be an easy democratic win
7836309 if obama picked sen joseph biden to solidify his foreign affairs credentials he did so with good reason by wide margins voters even some obama supporters trust mccain more to handle terrorism and international problems
7836310 by smaller margins obama still is viewed as best able to fix the economy which voters overwhelmingly see as the most important issue in the election

7836318 the most commonly encountered attitudes seen are discomfort and rejection making it invisible the reasons for this may be very diverse but are likely entrenched in our deepest evolutionary make up our primeval chance for survival in the early environments in which our species evolved was to socialise which implies a rejection of people who could compromise the chances of social survival i e the disabled the sick the elderly the outsiders this rejection is unlikely to result from our education because it can be seen even in very young neuro typical children however as argued below it can be changed through culture and education this rejection translates into various forms of abuse and bullying this can cause incredible distress to people who are different resulting in life long depression stress isolation and a sense of purposelessness
7836319 the knowledge we have gained in recent years of autism thanks particularly to growing numbers of reports made by individuals with autism their families and advocates have helped the general population to understand this condition better behaviors which were incomprehensible such as sudden bursts of distress various forms of repetitive behavior misunderstanding of people s intentions or alternative learning processes are now becoming understandable

7836348 spot homilies to blog newspaper type homilies to hypertext homilies that make daring connections between distant arguments to chakra homilies new age narrations with strong suggestions and vague meanings
7836349 to talk about homilies therefore means to be aware that they are made up of complexity and beauty
7836350 even if they have been marginalized poorly treated at times complicated and clericalized homilies are in any case a truly essential and indispensable center of the liturgy
7836351 there is no lack of studies aimed at developing a systematic even a virtual methodology of the homily
7836352 from of old dictionaries of homiletics exist texts that suggest methods of preparation using different models of homilies including already prepared outlines
7836353 a homily must be conceived as the common and shared hearing of revelation that comes through the word and history
7836354 the preacher must speak very very clearly so that the listener will leave satisfied and illumined and not dazzled
7836355 the difference between a pastor and an actor is precisely the existential moment the pastor must be poor when he preaches about poverty he must be slandered when he exhorts to endurance in slander while the actor has the task of deceiving by eliminating the existential moment the preacher in fact has the duty in the most profound sense to preach with his own life

7836381 weve also distributed our exchange environment but that plays into our disaster recovery as well the transition allows you to really take a holistic look at your environment and come up with a much better set of solutions in terms of accessibility recoverability and performance

7836480 the dollar continues to be boosted by increased expectations of weaker economic growth in other major developed economies
7836481 it is apparent that euro dollar is becoming more sensitive to downside surprises in eurozone economic data than us negative surprises
7836482 augusts fall in the german ifo business confidence index clearly adds to the recent run of bad news on the eurozones largest economy
7836483 the fall from 97 5 to a three year low of 94 8 was sharper than the consensus forecast but broadly in line with our own expectations
7836484 the decline was due to falls in both business expectations and perceptions of current conditions

7836498 as the presidential campaign turns increasingly personal and the new obama biden ticket strikes a decidedly more populist tone democrats believe a mccain romney ticket would provide a near perfect frame for their class conscious message
7836499 it will be a contest theyll say between the son of a single mother and son of a car salesman against the son of an admiral and son of a governor
7836500 and even those who are not passionately committed to one side or the other are trying to figure out why obama didnt just go through the motions of vetting clinton for the vice presidency tell her that she was high on the list and go through the entire process it wouldnt have been true and clinton probably would have known it wasnt true but what could she have done as it turned out since obama blew her off she can now claim that she was disrespected in all this

7836685 we felt it was a sound business decision to encourage the match as it helped us to illustrate the importance of the relationship foster an attitude of business collaboration and fortify the bond between the two cities this is crucial for our enterprise and others like us in the uk or the us it means that we can do anything together sell uk made cbrn suits throughout america or play against each other in a friendly rugby match
7836686 the inaugural mayors cup challenge match was a resounding success regardless of the final score of the match we had a fabulous experience in our sister city of dundee and a very successful trip on behalf of both alexandrias rugby team and its business community we feel that remploy frontlines support of alexandria rugby and the twinned cities programme will prove to be just as beneficial to our hometown as it is for dundee we look forward to building on what weve started over the years to come
7836687 remploy frontline is very proud to have been a part of this unique twinned city event we hope that our involvement in this programme encourages more businesses and organisations in both cities to look more closely at ways they can support the business and cultural exchanges based on remploy frontlines mission it would be great if alexandria and dundee can create more opportunities for otherwise disabled people and help further enrich their lives

7836694 we beat the boats team with the previous record and they even brought in two top uk professional ultra endurance runners this year for the footrace part of the challenge
7836695 as time goes on there are always new needs for the trust to keep it going the need for more funding to continue to exist so that more disabled children across britain can have more enriched lives the trust gives kids an opportunity to do things and accomplish physical feats that they normally could not the trust like remploy helps encourage people with disabilities who are too often told what they cannot do instead of shown what they can do

7836712 wenn ein spieler abgegeben wird kann es sein dass ein neuer geholt wird
7836713 power and with the advice and consent of the senate to make treaties provided two thirds of the senators present concur
7836714 so its not a treaty so it would not require senate ratification or anything like that its a bilateral agreement that would provide the authorities for our troops to operate in iraq
7836715 despite all the talk that we hear from the democratic party here in colorado about unity the democratic party is in fact not united
7836716 these clinton supporters are very frustrated with their party they are frustrated with the way hillary clinton was treated
7836717 they are frustrated that after the primary she was not even considered for the vice presidency
7836718 all of us have been incredibly loyal democrats i came into this town with my whole democratic family and i had tears in my eyes because its a terrible thing that this party has had this rift and its a real rift and the numbers show it
7836719 is running ads trying to divide us and let me state what i think about their tactics and these ads i am hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7836720 every one of us could stand up and recite all the reasons why we must elect barack
7836721 none of this will happen if john mccain is in the white house
7836722 nothings going to unify the democrats like the republicans you just wait until they start attacking sen obama as im sure they will in ways that will stir up those of us who are democrats and cause us to recognize exactly what the choice is
7836723 alla vigilia ci era stato detto di quale poteva essere il ritmo ma visti i tempi dei primi mi sono impressionato perch anche con questi climi possono esprimere il loro potenziale hanno iniziato con un km da 2 57 era impossibile per noi complimenti a loro
7836724 if mccain doesnt win ohio we dont think he can win the presidency
7836725 ohio was close last time and itll be close again
7836726 i think that what bush did in 2004 they really maxed out republican turnout if the question is do you think john mccains gonna replicate george bushs turnout in the state of ohio if the answer is no hes cooked
7836727 we have some doubts about mccains ability to duplicate that turnout we think we have more room to grow
7836728 what bush did in ohio in 2004 will go down in the annals of campaigns as one of the more amazing feats
7836729 because of the great job they did theyre closer to their ceiling than we are
7836730 a big part of it is the cost it would be to the public
7836731 the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans
7836732 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7836733 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7836734 and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
7836735 we have a big job here all week long for people to learn more about barack obama who he is what animates him and what he stands for
7836736 our goal coming out of the convention is for people to have a greater understanding of barack obama and a greater understanding of the choice in this election
7836737 obamas greatest convention task is not reconciling with clinton voters but just telling his story compellingly
7836738 he is surprisingly little understood and the mccain camp has been defining him in very negative ways either he makes the connection with voters this week or he could be seriously endangering democratic chances in what should be a strong democratic year
7836739 john mccains going to try to win this election by fear barack obama needs to reassure people how mainstream american he is
7836740 once people get comfortable with barack obama and who he is then mccains nasty tactics wont matter
7836741 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7836742 and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7836743 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7836744 we dont think any organisms belong in the amniotic sac
7836745 there is a very active effort to work with all the food distribution customers but it is not as direct because there are customers and then those customers have customers
7836746 really the safest thing you can do is make all your food at home from scratch period
7836747 sometimes we buy the product anyway and sometimes we dont
7836748 what does this really mean can i count on it as a consumer to really have any meaning

7836753 we have reached a conclusion that we should take off three zeroes from the current iraqi dinar banknotes
7836754 the process is progressing and we have taken some steps
7836755 the central bank governor sinan al shabibi has informed me that the bank is in the process of taking that decision
7836756 the central bank of iraq supports what the finance minister was saying
7836757 in a country like iraq where cash consists 80 of money dealing we need smaller bank notes
7836758 this time we arent in hurry if it takes two years to swap the new currency with the old one then let it so

7836782 i stand here today at the crosscurrents of that history
7836783 knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7836784 that was a problem i think 10 to 20 years ago
7836785 i think we were all guilty in not using enough discretion
7836786 im as guilty as the next guy down the street
7836787 sometimes we are in the middle because we have a number of parties we have to serve
7836788 no one likes the enforcement role when its applied against them and insurance companies understand that by and large
7836789 the profitability of our risk based products depends in large part on our ability to predict price for and effectively manage health care costs
7836790 you had a whole bunch of forces who said youve got to do more
7836791 they are resisting it but theyre resisting it with some legitimacy
7836792 it doesnt mean we dont as with any situation have issues that come up
7836793 as youre trying to do the best thing for our clients there are going to be a variety of healthy tensions
7836794 the role of the health insurer is to pay for quality health care really really quality health care
7836795 we do have a checks and balances type of a system
7836796 it really shook him up he and i both essentially went through high school and college fantasizing about christina applegate so at first he was really excited like dude i totally get to see christina applegate nude but i guess the trauma of realizing that he drove a dagger into the collective heart of men everywhere by cutting off the very things that helped him through the rough spots of puberty was just too much for him
7836797 it started out kind of funny actually she was lying there on the table unconscious he was joking around check it out im finally getting to touch kelly bundys boobs but then you could almost see a kind of black cloud of realization drift over him as i handed him the scalpel and he remembered the task at hand when it was all said and done he just stood there for awhile then screamed what have i done and ran out of the room crying
7836798 we cant make torchwood toys we cant market to children because its an adult show maybe we could do torchwood sex toys i will suggest it
7836799 when we refer people to the city it is a long way for them to travel so this hospital makes it easier for people to go locally thats the feedback we have had that people want to go locally it makes it easier for us and our patients

7836802 if theyre sending them all over the hospital there is no way of knowing whether the referral got there

7836808 we have provided daleks and components for the tardis in the past and i think a one off move to the screen would be amazing
7836809 it would take dr who to the next level so should be very successful

7836811 i really love wales so its great to have the chance to play at a big festival here instead of taking the motorway we took the road up through the brecon beacons i feel at home here
7836812 bryn has asked me to be involved for a few years but because of filming ive never been able to
7836813 honestly i was surprised we would have such good seating especially given the kerfuffle over the primary timing but they did and i guess thats an indication of the sort of interest the obama campaign has in winning florida this time
7836814 ive been all over the world this is the most exciting thing that ever happened to me in my life out of all the places i have been
7836815 i am just excited to be here i did not think in my lifetime i would see history being made this way perhaps for my grandchildren great grandchildren but i never think i would live to see this
7836816 the democrats im sure are worried about florida in november so theyre going to want to treat them they dont want anybody mad for the punishment from january 29th
7836817 will consider soon a step to restore the nuclear facilities in yongbyon to their original state
7836818 the u s is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in north korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq
7836819 visits to facilities review of documents interviews with technical personnel and other measures unanimously agreed upon among the six parties
7836820 the u s however raised all of a sudden an issue of applying an international standard to the verification of the nuclear declaration abusing this agreed point
7836821 it pressured north korea to accept such inspection as scouring any place as it pleases to collect samples and measure them
7836822 the measure is regrettable as it came at a time when the six parties have to make concerted efforts to complete phase two of the denuclearization process
7836823 will work closely with relevant countries to have north korea resume the disablement work as early as possible

7836832 we may not know who the democratic presidential nominee will be until the convention is over im giddy with anticipation
7836833 the va program in general is an exceptional program many veterans dont know it can even benefit them if he she is overseas weve been helping active duty service people by putting their families in homes and giving them peace of mind that their loved ones and their immediate needs are being taken care of while theyre away
7836834 this centre will undoubtedly improve access to nhs dental services in forth valley
7836835 i am sure that students will benefit enormously from the clinical experience they will gain at langlees and i am hopeful that some will stay in forth valley after they graduate
7836836 gli siamo piaciuti cos tanto che hanno deciso di farci recitare ancora
7836837 pochi giorni fa siamo stati a casa di catherine hardwicke la regista per provare le nuove scene stato molto divertente
7836838 e gli spettatori hanno detto che volevano scoprire un po di pi su un certo personaggio oppure che non avevano capito molto bene un certo punto della trama eccetera
7836839 flashback sulla storia della famiglia cullen sono un paio di scene ci siamo io e robert pattinson edward e poi rosalie ed emmett
7836840 gli spettatori volevano vedere pi scene con jacob quindi mi hanno ritagliato un posticino nella scena del ballo alla fine del film
7836841 twilight come titanic come romeo e giulietta due persone follemente innamorate ma il cui amore pericoloso
7836842 dobbiamo ancora girare qualche scena e poi dobbiamo occuparci delle musiche e degli effetti sonori e ovviamente gli effetti visivi
7836843 prometto di amarti per sempre ogni singolo giorno per leternit mi vuoi sposare
7836844 e dward theres something that i want to do before im not human anymore

7836849 making sure you are on tv heard on radio have a presence on the streets things like that are important and we have done a couple of concerts holding a concert was a big deal because apart from it being the first time any movie has done a concert with the cast it gave a great platform for us to interact directly with the audience of the movie
7836850 we have been so authentic about our presentation on the film and we have used that to tell the people that this is what you are going to get when you go to the theatre and thats what people want to see
7836851 before we shot the film there was a whole look test that they did and everyone had different ideas about the way they wanted to look i too had my mind set on certain things and i think if kd his character didnt have that look the band wouldnt look that good the beard adds so much to my character
7836852 there are dhbs who may not have produced a plan but are genuinely out there working with phos and practices to try and find solutions
7836853 the most critical component is working collectively with other players like the ambulance service phos and providers in some parts of the country thats worked really well but in others not so well

7836859 all of this came about because of how it was handled by the ajc it caused a fair bit of concern among trainers and the way it was presented
7836860 something that could have been a very simple thing has turned into something very complicated because it was done without consultation
7836861 the reality is part of his freedmans job is to deal with the trainers and to deal with us professionally and fairly and there was a view of the meeting this morning that that didnt happen
7836862 we had a meeting last night with richard freedman normal gillespie ajc chief executive and bob guth from the committee about various changes to the document
7836863 at the end of the day i dont think therell be much of an argument in the way of the document its all in the way in which it was done and thats where the issue with richard freedman came up
7836864 fallacies do not cease to be fallacies because they become fashions
7836865 when the men of our state department especially after world war ii went all over the world trying to implant our form freedom balance in government downward on cultures whose philosophy would never have produced it it has in almost every cases ended in some form of totalitarianism or authoritarianism
7836866 the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when i was 8 years old somehow reflects on me and my values doesnt make much sense
7836867 if the churches refuse to pray the politicians will continue to take wrong decisions about the people if the church has a united front we can help solve the problems facing the region and make input in the future of our nation the time has come to lead our people out of the problem the politicians are not serious and they are using the boys to prolong the problems this is the time for us to stand in the gap and pray for the deliverance of our people
7836868 it is important for god to touch you and also you touching god we can liberate our people by starting a non violent movement desmond tutu did it and martin luther king jr also did it when god touches the leaders they will see the need to do right to the people of the niger delta but it is only prayer that can do it
7836869 i called the leaders out for a purpose it is to pray that god should forgive us our sins president umar yaradua thought he can solve the problem of the niger delta but today he is confused but god has solution to the problems and a better road map
7836870 after today there will be a shaken in government cabinet also before the end of the year there will be a sweeping away of evil in the land and god will change the season the salt which we have prayed with will be used by god to restore everything back to the people
7836871 we have a spiritual problem in niger delta and we have to pray that things will improve for better because we have been oppressed and our blessings have been taken away since fighting and shedding of blood can not solve the problem the only way out is for us to pray
7836872 we may not care very much about the source of money but have you paid your taxes for the money you use
7836873 if it were to be in nigeria neither senator barack obama nor senator john mccain would have made it to become party presidential flag bearers because none of them belonged to the top party elite or hierarchy and in the case of mccain he did not get the support of the white house
7836874 if you have the press that people can trust as the voice of the people then it would serve as a vital support for democracy

7836895 biosecurity australia confirmed that the only option currently available is for horses from japan to be imported via an approved third country such as hong kong or singapore but given the quarantine periods required in each location this is unacceptable to the connections of the japanese horses
7836896 we are continuing to work with all parties to secure an acceptable quarantine regime for the european and north american horses that have been nominated
7836897 from all available facts before us some of the conveners of the nud are working in concert with some foreign entities who are hell bent on creating instability in nigeria in order to play down the growing influence of nigeria in regional and international affairs
7836898 the motive and intentions of this group are very clear to create confusion and cause general disaffection within the polity because of their failure at the polls
7836899 this we believe would not only undermine the gains made so far but would ultimately retard our progress as an emerging democracy the call for an interim government has no place in the constitution of the federal republic of nigeria and is therefore not only illegal but also treasonable to the extent that it calls for the overthrow of an established constitutional order
7836900 we are a member of the gnu how can we plot to overthrow a government we are part and parcel of
7836901 the allegation by the pdp amounts to shouting the breeze and it is the work of a ruling party that has no initiative on how to address the plethora of problems facing the country and how to ensure a better life for the countrys longsuffering citizens
7836902 there was no doubt that tension was mounting in the air especially in the wake of the triumphant and arrogant vauntings of the all conquering npn lords
7836903 shagari had also been disturbed by public attitude to his victory
7836904 general obasanjo also criticized the regime as unserious and profligate in an interview with dele giwa editor of the then sunday concord obasanjo said shagaris government was extravagant when it expected the rest of the country to endure some austere times shagari had just appointed a jumbo cabinet of 42 members including seven special advisers all these criticisms were wearing down the president
7836905 for instance while our projected national demand for fish is put at two million tonnes the local production stands at 550 000 metric tonnes the galp is filled through massive importation of fish making nigeria one of the largest importers of fish and fisheries
7836906 as im talking to you ribadu has already finished the course work and is working on his project so the vp will not recall him
7836907 the tradition is that even if an officer is retired while he is on course he will be allowed to finish his course
7836908 with profound respect the position of the police authorities on the studentship of mr ribadu is in irreconcilable conflict with the provisions of the nipss act
7836909 like the police service commission which was not in place for over one year the board of the nipss has not been constituted for quite sometime which is a reflection of the failure of governance in the country
7836910 even if the board had been properly constituted it would have lacked the power to recall or expel mr ribadu from the institute
7836911 contrary to the position of the police authorities it is the director general and chief executive of the institute who has been conferred with the powers to manage the affairs of the institute this in effect means that it is the management of nipss that can terminate the studies of a student who may have been found wanting in line with the rule of law and due process it has been established that no student of any educational institution in nigeria can have his her studies terminated when he she has not been found guilty of misconduct
7836912 another issue which has been conveniently glossed over is that the legitimate right of mr ribadu to the studentship of nipss had been acquired before the decision of the police service commission to demote him was taken it is trite in law that the rights of parties are to be decided according to the law when the action was commenced thus in afolabi v governor of oyo state 1985 2 nwlr pt 9 734 it was held by the supreme court that a law should not be interpreted to extinguish an accrued right or interest of any party the police authorities should therefore let sleeping dogs lie in the circumstances
7836913 prevailing legal position on the recall of kuru students was dealt with in extenso by the acting director general of the institute dr yakubu sankey in a somewhat courageous interview dr
7836914 they have requested for sometime to enable them get properly briefed about the issue since they are just coming into the saddle the outgoing service chiefs cannot appear before us and those coming in cannot just appear until they have been properly handed over to and decorated with their new paraphernalia of office
7836915 reacting to the fresh allegations by mend was beyond the scope of my brief from the leadership of the house
7836916 a civilian commercial transport boat which plies the yenagoa fropa southern ijaw route of bayelsa state was attacked by men of the military joint task force jtf on sunday at about 16 30 hrs
7836917 the jtfs explanation of the attack which led to the death of 12 passengers and one critically injured survivor made up of students women and children was that they heard the sound of gunfire minutes before the emergence of the passenger boat
7836918 this unfortunate killing of innocent civilians again calls for replacement of the military task force with the police in civilian areas it is clear that the soldiers acted out of panic and indiscipline and may even have been drunk
7836919 shes been really really cranky this week and thats when she goes well

7836968 golwalkar a founding member of the rss in a book that he wrote borrowed ideas from hitlers nazism his admiration for hitler was well known he rejected the idea that india was a secular nation and posited instead that it was a hindu rashtra a hindu system which a great of influence over much of the indian population
7836969 more than 94 per cent of the population is hindu christianity is practiced by only 2 4 per cent of the population there have been some conversions though among tribals who have often been abused by the people of the cities
7836970 here the majority would like to eliminate the cross but its roots are too deep and the cancer of nationalism will not prevail the church will be the light for many generations to come
7836971 barack obama is a pro abortion radical so theres nothing surprising about his choosing a pro abortion running mate
7836972 neither senator obama nor senator biden seems to have taken catholic arguments about the first principles of justice seriously
7836973 the churchs pro life position is not sectarian it can be engaged by anyone willing to work through a serious philosophical argument
7836974 neither obama nor biden seems willing to do that which casts a rather large shadow over their claims to be the ticket of thoughtfulness and intellectual seriousness
7836975 catholics for obama tying themselves into even tighter theological pretzels as they try to justify a vote for what seems likely to be the most radically pro abortion ticket in american history
7836976 an affable veteran politician who is unlikely to repeat the 2004 mistakes of sen john kerry by overselling his catholic credentials

7836980 the democrats are slapping faithful catholics right in the face first they will nominate the most pro abortion candidate in history then they refuse to invite the beloved archbishop of denver even to offer a prayer at their convention and now they nominate a pro abortion catholic as vice president only self hating catholics could vote for this ticket
7836981 the american bishops have made clear that catholic political leaders must defend the dignity of every human person including the unborn sadly joe bidens tenure in the united states senate has been marked by steadfast support for legal abortion
7836982 bidens own bishop bishop michael saltarelli of wilmington del has said that the issues pertaining to the sanctity of human life are the great civil rights issues of this generation
7836983 i would not appoint anyone who did not understand that section 5 of the 14th amendment and the liberty clause of the 14th amendment provided a right to privacy

7836992 during everyday life we constantly evaluate social behaviour and this largely affects how we feel about ourselves and other people but the way we store and use information about our own and other peoples social behaviour are not well understood

7836994 the most distinctive feature of depressive disorders is an exaggerated negative attitude to oneself which is typically accompanied by feelings of guilt
7836995 now that we understand how the brains of healthy individuals respond to feelings of guilt we hope to be able to better understand why and where there are differences in brain activity in people suffering from or prone to depression
7836996 the brain region we have identified to be associated with proneness to guilt has been shown to be abnormally active in patients with severe depression in several previous studies but until now its involvement in guilt had been unknown
7836997 by translating these basic cognitive neuroscience insights into clinical research we now have the potential to discover new key functional anatomical characteristics of the brain that may lie behind depressive disorders
7836998 the results will hopefully make an important contribution to our understanding of the causes of depression that will ultimately allow new approaches to find better treatments and prevention

7837034 my dad allan had just coached featherstone to a shock challenge cup final success over hull

7837040 we appreciate we are massive underdogs but so were featherstone in 1983 and hull in 2005
7837041 anything can happen in a one off but we have overcome plenty of adversity this season and are capable of beating anyone on our day

7837043 i wasnt good enough to play full time although had a couple of opportunities
7837044 i knew if i was ever going to give up a good day job and step into full time sport i wanted to do it in coaching

7837046 im very much my own man but am proud of my dads achievements and chat to him about the game
7837047 he never tries to influence me because i have my own ideas and am happy to learn from my own mistakes
7837048 we chat about current affairs in the game rather than me trying to pick his brain

7837096 people from 71 nations are participating in cyg and it is our responsibility as citizens of pune to portray our city as clean and hygienic
7837097 it is the same as if the government decides to ask people to deposit money for complaining against any corrupt officer with the department head the decision of the mci will upset the patients seeking action against errant doctors
7837098 patients belonging to bpl families will have to provide a certificate issued by a government authority along with the complaint
7837099 in 1995 the supreme court brought the patient doctor relationship under the ambit of the consumer protection act 1986 as a result the number of medical negligence cases have raised substantially for suing a doctor patients do not have to pay anything for filing a civil case at the consumer forum
7837100 the decision to charge fee for filing complaint or appeal before the medical council of india with respect medical malpractice or negligence is taken by the ethics committee of mci which is further approved by the executive committee
7837101 even if the mci wanted to check fictitious complaints the charges should be less it will further prevent people from coming up with filing cases against medical negligence

7837119 tragically our products have been linked to illnesses and loss of life
7837120 theres no evidence of listeria contamination in our products beyond the production lines originally under investigation
7837121 i think that as theyve acted extremely responsibly after a short while the consumers will forget about it theyve got a very short memory
7837122 theyre a leading company in their field they produce good products and they have stepped into the breach when necessary so in six months everybody will have forgotten about it
7837123 maple leafs strategy is almost a textbook copy of what johnson amp johnson did
7837124 so if this is done well it can really mean that the brand doesnt have to suffer too much
7837125 what theyre doing is protecting the brand and its the brand that matters in the long term for maple leaf without the brand they dont have anything
7837126 so theyve been very very proactive about it unusually so because most companies that go through crises of this nature tend to hide its quite commendable from a business point of view
7837127 i think theres enough lawyers out there that like this kind of business that there will be lawsuits
7837128 they can recover a very high proportion of their business maybe 95 per cent 98 per cent theres only a few hardcore people who wont go back to eating roast beef but if they dont handle it properly then it can be a significant loss of business
7837129 the reality is that the risks are huge because youre not just looking at an isolated part of the business but youre looking at a risk to every product that has the maple leaf name on it
7837130 its going to take some time for them to recover from it no matter what they do but this kind of thing at least can help keep them in peoples minds as a company thats reasonably trustworthy and when there is a problem they face up to it and deal with it

7837146 were talking about the nominee for the president of the united states
7837147 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black

7837151 linksys is conscious of the environment actively participating in waste take back programs and reducing hazardous wastes in our products we are now redoubling our efforts with the new packaging and have received energy star ratings on select routers modems gateways and adapters
7837152 this change is driven by our responsibility to better how we manage the environmental impact of our products and operations our overall use of paper is significantly less than what we were using but the cost of using recyclable products and bio degradable inks is about the same costs as what we were using we hope our efforts will encourage other companies to take a look at their packaging and do what they can to reduce resource usage and waste

7837188 over the past three fiscal years we have implemented several company wide initiatives to revitalize growth and improve service to students
7837189 these initiatives which focus on employee retention and development marketing regulatory compliance and other key operational processes are producing tangible results for continuing operations we generated new student growth of 13 0 in fiscal 2008 and began to improve operating margins in fiscal 2009 we believe higher enrollment will allow us to achieve greater economies of scale improve facility utilization and further expand margins
7837190 our fiscal 2008 performance was achieved in the context of the most challenging student financing environment in the companys history
7837191 during the fourth quarter we implemented several changes to offset the loss of sallie mae private loans for students with sub prime credit profiles we established a new company sponsored student lending program access and thus far have arranged financing for the vast majority of students through title iv cash payments access and other resources

7837208 our disappointing earnings results for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 were primarily the result of lower than anticipated sales and the higher merchandise markdowns required to drive sales and lower the chicos brand inventory levels closer to current sales trends accordingly we achieved a 13 per square foot reduction for the chicos brand as we transitioned from the spring merchandising season to the fall merchandising season
7837209 the retail environment continues to be challenging as customers remain increasingly cautious in their spending across the entire retail sector especially in the missy category while we anticipate consolidated comparable store sales for the fall season to remain negative we expect to see an improvement in trend and continue to believe we will be profitable in the second half
7837210 although our second quarter results are disappointing we are encouraged by our initial reads on our fall offerings also we continue to maintain a very strong balance sheet with cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 278 million and no debt further we remain focused on reducing expenses and managing lower inventory levels without affecting our ability to serve our customers we are also limiting capital expenditures to those that are necessary to sustain the business while targeting an acceptable return on where we choose to invest
7837211 we have just scratched the surface of possibilities associated with the immense opportunities that await us
7837212 by utilizing reconstituted rubber alloys in products that would normally have been created from dwindling virgin raw materials the possibilities are virtually endless only ones imagination can limit the infinite applications that will impact our daily lives with the products we will create

7837240 energy storage and powers caes technology is poised to become an important part of the dispatch stack that can address the intermittency of renewables and reduce on peak power costs
7837241 our company examined the technology for its own use and decided that the potential was great enough that we wanted a larger role in helping to make compressed air energy storage a technology that is broadly embraced by the electricity sector we believe this technology is an important component of a broad effort to combat climate change an effort that must include increased conservation expanded renewable energy and new clean central power
7837242 pseg has the expertise and financial resources to bring this technology out of the development stage and into the deployment stage we have learned a lot since building the mcintosh plant in alabama and i believe the time is right technically environmentally and economically for a large scale deployment of es amp ps caes technology
7837243 the technology has evolved to the point where it can be critical to helping this nation meet its growing energy needs while helping decrease carbon emissions from the electricity sector
7837244 we see strong market potential for caes in the traditional power industry as well as for the growing renewable energy industry
7837245 energy storage is the missing piece of the puzzle for a green affordable and reliable electric grid for the 21st century caes units can manage wind output to create a highly valuable firm dispatchable product even independent of wind it can be a cost effective intermediate generation source for energy arbitrage capacity and ancillary services i am very excited to launch this initiative with dr nakhamkin and look forward to working with him as we grow this business
7837246 clearly compressed air energy storage has significant potential as a near term viable large scale energy storage technology
7837247 as we see greater and more widespread integration of intermittent generation such as wind gain acceptance storage technologies like caes will become even more vital we look forward to working with pseg and other industry players in helping to accelerate the development and deployment of caes plant technology with both above ground and underground reservoirs for the storage of compressed air as an essential next step in advancing a cleaner and more environmentally sound energy future

7837259 i felt that joining the air force was something i needed to do as a citizen
7837260 my father had tried to get me to join all along
7837261 he thought that because i had finished college that i had moved past my interest in it
7837262 but he was very supportive of my decision and happy that i finally joined
7837263 it seems like theres always some disaster that requires a command post controller
7837264 i was an airman 1st class right out of technical school
7837265 it took a while longer for me to go because i hadnt even been issued my travel card yet thats how green i was
7837266 at times it was overwhelming but i learned so much so quickly
7837267 the experience was invaluable i feel like i can deploy into any situation do my job and do it effectively
7837268 volunteering is the only way guardsmen can come over here
7837269 i felt it was a good time to deploy its right before i start my nursing degree and i dont want to go through my entire career without doing anything or going anywhere
7837270 shes a stellar controller always motivated always eager to learn and always raising the bar
7837271 shes forthright shes honest and she upholds standards the way everyone in the air force should
7837272 its interesting to go from the peacetime perspective with the unit readiness exercises and the operational readiness inspections to a wartime environment where youre using the skills youve always practiced
7837273 instead of just performing tasks shes always aware airman ross took charge and saw her projects come to fruition this deployment rotation was lucky to have her

7837318 that the oil giants that once dominated the global market have lost much of their influence and with it their ability to increase supplies
7837319 about 20 percent reflects slowing global growth and with it reduced demand for more oil in the short term
7837320 the scope of the supply problem became more clear in the latest quarter when the five biggest publicly traded oil companies including exxon mobil said their oil output had declined by a total of 614 000 barrels a day even as they posted 44 billion in profits it was the steepest of five consecutive quarters of declines while that drop might not sound like much in a world that consumes 86 million barrels of oil each day todays markets are so tight that the slightest shortfalls can push up prices

7837329 secondly the dprk north korea will consider soon a step to restore the nuclear facilities in yongbyon to their original state as strongly requested by its relevant institutions
7837330 the us is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in the dprk as it pleases just as it did in iraq
7837331 north korean leader kim jong il seems to have made a strategic decision that he will no longer continue negotiations with the bush administration
7837332 for a big country to trifle with a small country
7837333 as far as the verification is concerned it is a commitment to be fulfilled by the six parties at the final phase of the denuclearisation of the whole korean peninsula
7837334 the north will escalate tensions in accordance with how the us reacts
7837335 to accept inspections in which they may visit wherever they want collect samples and take measurements as they please

7837520 apr s la temp te de neige after the snow storm
7837521 it felt as though life was over because shes the love of his life and he only wants her and nobody else so he felt hes got to do something to try and win her back
7837522 he starts spending a bit more time with amber so tina can see in order to make her jealous and want to go back out with him
7837523 theyre round at the platts watching a dvd and tina kicks off and wants to know why hes rubbing her nose in it
7837524 david doesnt hes just using her amber feels shes got something with david shes fancied him for a while but its an act from him to win the love of his life back again
7837525 theres been a lot of rubbish in the papers over the last couple of weeks and its nice just to put it to bed now
7837526 were delighted at the club and the players are because hes a talisman for all of us
7837527 i think we spent the last two weeks worrying is he going to go is he going to stay and now weve put it to bed and we can concentrate on the premier league
7837528 michael martine is one of the best in the blogosphere
7837529 january was just a case of me feeling like i deserved the opportunity to play and not getting it
7837530 you always feel a little bit hard done by in those circumstances but i respect the players
7837531 i respect the fact that we have a lot of ability people like benni mccarthy matt derbyshire roque santa cruz its always going to be tough to play and i respect that
7837532 but obviously you feel like youve earned that right and you feel disappointed
7837533 im happy now because im playing and the next time that changes i wont be happy
7837534 im glad im here and hopefully ill be here for years to come scoring goals
7837535 i still dont think blackburn have seen the best of me so hopefully that will be coming
7837536 i feel sharp at the moment people have shown belief in me and given the opportunity to show what i can do so hopefully i can grab that with both hands
7837537 ive had a good pre season scored a few goals and felt sharp
7837538 but thats happened previously and ive not had the opportunity to get a run so its just good to get a run in the side now and have it to lose so to speak
7837539 ive played the games and as far as im concerned i need to keep on playing well and trying to make sure that i start in the next game
7837540 weve got quality players all over the park you look at our bench and you know youre playing well to be starting
7837541 but at the moment i feel like its all coming together and hopefully blackburn will get to see the best of me
7837542 its good you know what youre going to get from roque
7837543 hes always going to give 100 percent hes always going to provide a goal threat
7837544 the more we play together the more we understand each others game well just keep endeavouring to do that
7837545 if we are both playing at our best then we can cause people some problems
7837546 with the support of the guys behind us i think it could be a very exciting season for us
7837547 jason deserved a goal against everton last week and he got his just rewards today
7837548 it got to 75 minutes and i thought that maybe hed had his time and it was time to put benni mccarthy on but hes awesome at holding the ball up and causing problems
7837549 theyve all impressed me and its early doors you dont rush into judgements and it takes a couple of months before you form an opinion on where you want to go

7837636 what is he like if you invite him for a bbq

7837638 so you might want to add that as an update in your post the noise and image quality should be right in line with the d300 as this camera was intended specifically to compete with the d300 it will be announced on the 26th of this month
7837639 sex drive in humans has very little to do with procreation although no sex drive at all tends to reduce the likelihood of pregnancy
7837640 humans and monkeys are the only creatures in nature who have sex for fun all other species have sex only for procreation this naturally leads to confusing questions about whether nature intended sex to be used for anything other than procreation but we at big pharma really dont care as long as we can sell drugs to increase sex drive if you want it or cut it down if you dont we also dont care if you never make up your mind the market for uppers and downers for emotional management is good so we think that products to ramp sex drive up and down will also be good and i dont mean that as male metaphor although i suppose it could be used that way
7837641 having children particularly the way the 61 year old did by giving birth to her own grandchild has nothing to do with sex drive and everything to do with procreation
7837642 i dont care for sex and never did but i like children and believe strongly that they are our future i want a good future so i want lots of kids i dont care for men much though but at this point in the evolutionary time window theyre still needed if you want to get knocked up without a lot of expense not only do i not have to pay anyone for invitro fertilization these guys usually will even pick up the drink tab and sometimes dinner you stick to your mission and do what works
7837643 currently there are no medications approved by the u s food and drug administration fda for the treatment of low sexual desire
7837644 only people have i think therefore i am consciousness and only people and monkeys have sex for fun in addition to procreation its time that we humans evolve beyond the animals that only have sex for procreation and beyond monkeys who have it for fun and procreation humans should only be having sex for fun
7837645 we would stop over population thereby reducing humankinds footprint on the environment and reduce our demand for earths resources and sex can be highly physical and can be used for exercise and better health im telling you we can upgrade the human race and stop global warming in one fell swoop ill bet the big pharma folks will buy in

7837668 is shabab taking orders from al qaeda i would say no they are still running their own show

7837692 the globe is a very unique performing arts venue and music is a very integral part of all of the productions that we do it struck us that we havent that celebrated enough
7837693 we have trained musicians who work here and understand the space and in many cases they are using original instruments in a contemporary context it is a very interesting mix
7837694 it is opportunity to take the work of the globe and reach new audiences and that is something that we are always very keen to do obviously we want people wherever they are in the world to be able to experience our work the medium of music seems the ideal way to do this

7837697 georgia chose the least human way to achieve its goal to absorb south ossetia by eliminating a whole nation
7837698 i was immensely relieved when the doctors and nurses explained to me and my wife that rapidarc treatments focus just on the tumor
7837699 earlier technology for radiotherapy limited the number of angles we could use for striking at a tumor
7837700 with rapidarc technology we are seeing excellent treatment plans that permit us to target the tumor from nearly every angle in a 360 degree circle around the patient the impressive thing is that when we use rapidarc to target the tumor from more angles we can deliver a treatment using less radiation and it only takes two minutes
7837701 the vast majority of our patients since then have had no complications following treatment
7837702 i couldnt imagine how we would improve on that but with rapidarc we have we can get the same results two to eight times faster than was possible with our earlier technology
7837703 whereas we generally treated four patients each hour rapidarc is making it possible for us to treat up to five patients an hour with plenty of time in between appointments having extra time for administrative tasks will help us ensure that charges are captured correctly and cut back on time consuming billing errors
7837704 ive been pleased with the thoughtful and efficient care ive been getting at image guided radiation therapy
7837705 im in the treatment room for only about five minutes per session because i live so close to the care center im only away from home about an hour each day the doctors told me that i was one of the very first patients in the northeast to receive treatments using this technology i think its wonderful that people are inventing these devices its a miracle as far as im concerned
7837706 nearly 1 in 20 women are refused treatment in cases of rape and the doctors decline to give these women referrals to get the morning after pill or pregnancy shots because its against their moral ethical and religious principles
7837707 18 percent of these doctors and hospitals felt no obligation to refer patients elsewhere
7837708 its obscene doctors swear an oath to serve their patients but instead they are allowing their religious beliefs to compromoise patient care and too often the victims of this practice are women

7837713 the early indications are good at the drilling sites we look forward to releasing results of the assay tests as they become available
7837714 the sizeable pay increases we are seeing in mid level it support and technical roles is being driven largely by acute skills shortages
7837715 as the uk it sector continues to specialise in more high end technical work and more entry level jobs are outsourced overseas there are fewer opportunities for graduates and those with less experience to get a foot on the first rung of the career ladder
7837716 the knock on effect is that higher up that ladder where there is demand for skilled and experienced workers there is not enough supply coming through the ranks making recruitment and retention more difficult driving up salaries as a result
7837717 in an increasingly competitive and challenging market environment we have been particularly focused on margin protection
7837718 we have been strengthening our off shore delivery capability with new delivery centres in china penang malaysia india and puerto pico and our resources in these centres now account for 33 per cent of total headcount

7837737 the issues of unco ordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids

7837834 i think that keith really wants to give back he doesnt just have a foundation that he is the face of hes really involved and actually very hands on
7837835 keith interacts with the children he doesnt just sign autographs he talks about the importance of giving back he works directly with the child welfare system in tennessee and for our organization thats very important because then its not just lip service

7837905 journal of palestine studies vol iv 1975 rather than succumb to the influence of various lobbying groups in washington such as aipac and the untold amount of money they use to dictate policy wouldnt it be more prudent to examine the real effects that collective punishment daily humiliation and countless civilian causalities inflicted by the israelis have on an occupied population and use that understanding to formulate a more rational approach toward the palestinians

7837926 i keep saying over and over that the social platform race is a race to my contact list but there still isnt an effective solution i currently subscribe to salesforce com but paying 55 a month seems like a lot of money to spend on something that isnt extremely easy to use and offers 10 000 more features than ill ever use
7837927 its a deal where for a flat fee can use as much of salesforce as it cares to through 2011 unlimited users unlimited objects unlimited storage etc im guessing this is the first deal of its kind in the world imagine what you could do without limits im kind of drooling right now
7837928 ive had a couple of customers that implemented the salesforce com customer service amp support application but couldnt be convinced to decommission their old support system because they wanted to keep using their existing knowledge base salesforce coms acquisition of instranet is great news and should resolve this objection

7837951 our principal focus right now has been on the india civil nuclear deal having worked through the iaea now working through the nsg and still trying to get into a position to make the appropriate presidential determinations in early september so thats our focus right now on the civil nuclear side
7837952 i think we have another nuclear agreement in the queue ahead of that russian deal that were really focussed on right now and thats the india civil nuclear agreement and thats generating a lot of work and time and energy on our part to get that done
7837953 we were able to work that through the iaea and now working with the nsg and trying to get that through nsg and eventually for presentation to our congress
7837954 last year it sucked to lose so its nice to win again

7837961 we had a couple of chances in the first 10 minutes to start the game off well and get up in front of the eight ball
7837962 but its typical city they pounce on mistakes that you make we made one we were slow clearing the ball and we were down 1 0 and once they score on you they are very tough to crack down
7837963 that 19 0 to us meant absolutely nothing the most important thing for us was to win tonight

7838036 he swanson has had a really really good pre season for the first time in his life i think hes done all the running hes run himself over the summer maybe he doesnt look it but hes a bit stronger and i think hes a little bit quicker
7838037 so he is a huge part of my plans but hes player in certain games that he might not be of any use to us

7838047 he played 20 odd games in the premier league last season and scored three goals
7838048 they have taken monitors out of the dugout but if i had seen the replay of the first challenge on the keeper that would have stopped me throwing my toys out of the pram because i would have said fair enough i can see why he didnt give it a few things happened after that and then the penalty really got me to boiling point

7838104 acel domn a vorbit gresit si ca romanii aveau relatii bune cu minoritatea maghiara
7838105 si aveau dreptate cand partidul de opozitie a ajuns la putere un an mai tarziu partidul minoritatii maghiare a sustinut noul guvern in 2004 romania a aderat la nato cu sustinerea dlui binden

7838131 there is no link at the moment between skills training and affirmative action
7838132 the people who are still denying the skills shortage are the people who are destroying affirmative action

7838201 i was watching a program the other day and the running back had a fumbling problem and they made him walk around on campus i thought what better way to give guys incentive and make him conscious of holding that ball to help him out you dont want to take away from his running ability and being so conscious that he is not worried about it but at the same time when he is running his style of running you want to make sure he protects the ball its really to benefit him and help him out as much as possible
7838202 its a team thing just to let you know that the team cares about you if you are hurting the team we want to console you right now we are consoling him in a different kind of way

7838225 these people are considered dangerous and could possibly be armed so we are asking the public please do not approach them

7838237 der lehrerberuf zehrt auf die dauer an der gesundheit niemand der die realit t an den schulen kennt die zunehmende arbeitsverdichtung die gestiegene psychische und physische belastung die hetze im schulalltag und die gestiegenen unterrichtsverpflichtungen bei steigenden klassengr en wundert sich dar ber dass sehr viele lehrer und lehrerinnen nach 30 berufsjahren drastisch gesagt auf dem zahnfleisch aus dem unterricht kriechen
7838238 heute haben die lehrer und lehrerinnen auf den letzten metern ihres anstrengenden berufslebens keine aussicht mehr auf entlastung das muss sich dringend ndern
7838239 es ist ein skandal dass der arbeitgeber d h die landesregierung keine arbeitsbedingungen garantieren kann die allen kolleginnen erm glicht bis zur pension vollzeit zu arbeiten ohne dabei dauerkrank zu werden
7838240 wir sch tzen dass daf r weitere rund eintausend zus tzliche lehrkr fte eingestellt werden m ssen die beh rde hat nun die aufgabe die konkrete zahl und den finanzierungsaufwand zu berechnen und l sungen zu finden
7838241 gute schule ist auch eine mischung aus erfahrung und frischem wind

7838247 it was very difficult to find venture capital to use it to develop new companies this has been changing
7838248 venture capitalists are starting to come not only from outside brazil to brazil but even inside brazil there have been groups forming
7838249 they are new for brazil and they are designed in brazil
7838250 one of the things i know i want to do is write a theme that will permeate throughout the entire work that will somehow be a universal theme how im going to depict that musically im not sure yet
7838251 when we started the glast project we wanted to find ways to communicate not only the science results to a broad audience but also tell the story of how the observatory was built by an extraordinary international team of scientists and engineers
7838252 the prelude effectively communicates the excitement of building and launching the observatory and provides a glimpse of what glast may see in the high energy universe
7838253 the idea is to get people excited about science at a time when there are lots and lots of budget cuts for science and research at a lot of institutions including stanford
7838254 the more the public is interested in science the better it is going to be so much of what we can be grateful for comes out of cutting edge science research
7838255 i found myself really falling in love with science and with the science behind glast in terms of particle physics cosmology and astronomy
7838256 so its been an eye opener for me as well that these two paradigms are so compatible
7838257 the beauty of this satellite in orbit i really wanted to capture that
7838258 the idea is that it will be a little bit of peter and the wolf meets gustav holsts the planets prokofievs peter and the wolf is a story with the depiction of the story in music with the orchestra theres a section of text which is read and music follows that and sonically depicts what is spoken occasionally there is text under the music
7838259 its critical for brands to reach this market they realize that
7838260 this is something new that kind of already requires awareness because a lot of this is driven through peoples perception of the product
7838261 when youre sharing an affinity for something its kind of hard to grasp exactly what new products encompass without knowing what they already are
7838262 so thinking that theyre going to do engagement ads and that its going to be success alone isnt going to be sufficient
7838263 global warming isnt a pretty suv ad its a frightening reality
7838264 the brands should roll with the negative feedback and listen and incorporate some of that feedback in their upcoming products
7838265 the last thing they should do is shut the ads down
7838266 theres a large amount of social responsibility that comes into play here
7838267 when youre sharing peoples opinions and associating them with certain things it takes a personal attachment that hasnt been used in advertising before
7838268 what they need to do is develop resources for the marketers that will help them be more confident
7838269 maybe the company could develop a marketing conference for marketers on facebook their developer conference in san francisco was huge why arent they doing this for the brands
7838270 facebook is throwing all kinds of pasta at the wall when it comes to marketing and to see what sticks
7838271 they havent figured it out and unfortunately theyre using brands as the guinea pigs and their customers they really have to make it clear to their community what works and what doesnt and develop best practices sooner or later
7838272 ive served my country my whole life first in the navy then in the house and then in the senate i want to be your president because i have always put my country first and through my experience i think i can continue to do that as your president senator obama an outsider without a lot of experience is criticizing governor palins experience her experience is that of having battled corruption her whole time in public life and as serving as chief executive of a state senator obamas experience consists of giving a popular speech in 2002 getting elected to the senate in a race that was virtually non contetested and after a year of few notable accomplishments there announcing his candidacy for president

7838290 for preemption purposes slusas definition of a covered class action should be applied only at the time a state action is removed to federal court not after a federal court issues a consolidation order
7838291 n o covered class action based upon the statutory or common law of any state or subdivision thereof may be maintained in any state or federal court by any private party
7838292 a group of lawsuits constitutes a covered class action if 1 the suits are pending in the same court 2 the suits involve common questions of law or fact 3 damages are sought on behalf of more than 50 persons and 4 the lawsuits are joined consolidated or otherwise proceed as a single action for any purpose
7838293 more than fifty plaintiffs and common questions of law or fact
7838294 are joined consolidated or otherwise proceed as a single action for any purpose
7838295 provided a single damages figure for the plaintiffs in all ten cases
7838296 it was the plaintiffs who created the foundation for slusa preemption by filing nearly identical complaints jointly scheduling discovery filing joint motions providing nearly identical discovery responses and using the same experts and expert reports consolidation did not force the plaintiffs to act in unison they did so on their own and they must now face the consequences

7838301 irans government has said it will import 5 million tonnes while unofficial sources have put the total as high as 9 million tonnes
7838302 in addition to 1 million tons of u s wheat iran is believed to have purchased 1 5 million tons of canadian wheat 1 5 million tons of black sea wheat and 1 million tons of european wheat traders said the u s government prohibits virtually all trade with iran except for carpets dried fruit nuts and caviar however there are additional exceptions for humanitarian aid medicine and food

7838307 i knew before you knew gayle i knew before you did but thats all ill say but people ask did i play a role absolutely not i always tell him this is your choice you will be the president of the united states and youve got to have somebody that you can trust that you think will have your back that believes in you i give the general advice is the person a good man
7838308 when i told the girls who the choice was i said its this man named senator biden and malia our oldest said well is he nice and we said yes hes a very nice man i met his family and he believes in family and he works hard and then she said is he smart and i said hes very smart she was like well if hes a nice man and hes smart then it sounds like a good decision

7838323 its one of the most significant job losses in australia this year and its obviously going to have a serious impact on the ongoing quality of the companys papers magazines and websites in australia and new zealand the important question here is the sort of damage this is going to do to the company for a bit of short term benefit a bit of short term cost savings
7838324 we have to be a leaner more agile fundamentally different company if we are going to succeed in the modern media world we are very comfortable that we are not going to in any sense undermine the quality of the papers
7838325 i think that adam has separated himself with the performance that he had on friday night

7838327 its a world we better figure out because we cant ask our students to come into a classroom put those things aside and sit in a row and think were interesting
7838328 there has been a tendency to use technology as a substitute for curriculum
7838329 technique and how to ideas have taken the place of deciding what it is exactly we want these children to learn
7838330 but i have nothing against the technology if its in the service of grown ups facing their responsibilities to decide what the students need to know precisely if they did that these technical gadgets will be valuable
7838331 it gives kids a chance to use things they already use in real life and make that connection in school
7838332 we did have to take a hard line approach to that
7838333 you can restrict all kinds of stuff and you can drive yourself nuts trying to police all of it they culbreth are probably kind of opening themselves up to something
7838334 these teachers say this pilot signals their commitment to our students to meet them where they are as opposed to where the teachers are comfortable

7838349 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7838350 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner

7838366 saakashvili chose genocide for resolving his political problems saakashvili has thus killed every hope for peaceful coexistence of ossetians abkhazians and georgians within one country
7838367 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7838368 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7838369 will continue to stand with the people of georgia and their democracy and to support its sovereignty and territorial integrity
7838370 i dont think any georgian government can accept losing those territories
7838371 absolutely in the future this is a recipe for future clashes if it is accepted by the russian government sooner or later the fighting will re erupt
7838372 recognition by russia of the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia is the necessary condition for ensuring the security of these peoples
7838373 investigations by unama united nations assistance mission in afghanistan found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men

7838375 this is matter of grave concern to the united nations i have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
7838376 the impact of such operations undermines the trust and confidence of the afghan people in efforts to build a just peaceful and law abiding state
7838377 what it took for him to get here was something i never thought id see in my life
7838378 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7838379 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7838380 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7838381 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7838382 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7838383 to discuss ways in which his foundation is addressing some of the worlds most pressing problems
7838384 president clinton understands this is sen obamas convention and he is here to do all he can to make sen obama our next president
7838385 were talking about the nominee for the president of the united states
7838386 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7838387 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7838388 we may be faced with the extinction of another one the vaquita in mexico

7838392 no one with common sense can expect to cooperate with russia in one part of the world while acting against it in another
7838393 its not in russias interests for nato to be defeated and leave behind all these problems
7838394 we would prefer nato to complete its job and then leave this unnatural geography
7838395 but at the same time well be the last ones to moan about natos departure

7838411 once in the small intestine the nanoparticle gets sticky and bonds to the intestinal wall it then leaks its contents directly into the intestinal cells which allows them to be absorbed directly into the blood stream

7838422 its important to test any scientific tool because all have limits some situations are more suited than others for barcode use
7838423 this research could help clarify the answer to that question
7838424 to have that kind of data is hugely valuable and the list of applications is endless and spans all of biology
7838425 but it all hinges on building an accurate database our study is a cautionary tale if were going to do it lets do it right
7838426 building a genetic library of all life is a great goal
7838427 but we need to pay careful attention to the data that go into that library to make sure they are accurate
7838428 we thought it prudent to increase our liquidity during this time of general market uncertainty
7838429 however we are also sensitive to dilution of our shareholders so we were careful with the amount of capital raised at this time we are proud that this offering was completed entirely from current shareholders and senior management

7838432 calipers test results from the initial phase of the toxcast screening program provided high quality data and demonstrated a substantial number of positive results or hits that may have potential relevance to environmental toxicity or adverse effects with this new funding we will expand our testing to determine the potency or concentration response of these bioactivities using all 230 of the initial assays
7838433 this follow up screening is an important step in the progress of the toxcast program we look forward to continuing our research efforts and supporting the epas efforts to better understand the impact and minimize the threat of environmental contaminants

7838460 if your vice president had to be an athlete who would you pick
7838461 well ill tell you what im a chicago guy so im thinking walter payton sweetness that guy had durability he could block as well as run michael doesnt lose and since i havent won the presidency yet that wouldnt be a bad teammate to have id just keep on feeding him and figure hed hit the last shot
7838462 because of human rights issues there was a loud cry for president bush to boycott the opening ceremonies of the beijing summer games if you had been president faced with that what would you have done
7838463 well i said very early on that i dont want olympics to be overly politicized but when a host country is violating human rights i think we have to say something it would have been an appropriate statement for the president to say that i will not go to the opening games unless we have seen some progress on the issue of tibet if all of us are silent all the time then human beings all across the globe are being silenced and being oppressed in ways that i dont think captures the olympic spirit
7838464 congress played a vital role through its hearings and baseball union and players union into more frequent testing for performance enhancing drugs and stricter penalties when you were watching the hearings what did you think of them

7838468 hummer production trucks give us a competitive advantage in desert racing
7838469 our ability to win each of the production classes at the past two races demonstrates the durability of these trucks in long distance grueling conditions
7838470 driving the entire race much more arduous than it appears
7838471 its grueling enough when things are going well but when things go wrong it becomes even more difficult to stay focused i could not have finished this race without the team hummer support crew
7838472 as industry innovators we are delighted to be able to work with rocco fortes browns hotel to produce this super sized snack the ostrich egg is the latest and largest addition to our range so it only seemed fitting to let lee streeton have a bit of fun with it and cook up something rather different for the albemarle carving trolley
7838473 genuine scotch eggs epitomise good honest food so what could be better than making an extra large version using the best of british as a chef that is passionate about sourcing local fresh foods it has been enormous fun to re create this much loved picnic staple and champion a food that has been part of our history for hundreds of years

7838475 nadat ik je sloeg schreef je in het zand nu ik je gered heb schrijf je op steen waarom doe je dat
7838476 wanneer iemand je kwetst en je schrijft het in zand dan zal de wind van vergeving het uitwissen als iemand iets goeds voor je doet zou je het in steen moeten schrijven de wind kan het dan nooit uitwissen
7838477 nee dat zullen we niet mama dat is niet wat je zei vanmorgen
7838478 vanmorgen wanneer zei ik dat we door de regen konden rennen en niet nat zouden worden
7838479 weet je dat niet meer toen je met papa praatte over zijn kanker toen zei je als we hier doorheen geraken samen komen we door alles heen
7838480 lieverd je hebt gelijk laten we door de regen rennen als het zo moet zijn dat men ons vanuit hierboven nat laat worden wel dan hadden we misschien juist een wasbeurt nodig
7838481 all the difficulties of the past 10 months made it difficult to make decisions about my future but if you ask me whether i am considering taking a step back the answer is yes
7838482 i do not consider the word withdrawal as meaning goodbye
7838483 i assume that i will be with the team also next year

7838491 frank marshall davis alleged communist was early influence on barack obama
7838492 although identified only as frank in mr obamas memoir dreams from my father it has now been established that he was frank marshall davis a radical activist and journalist who had been suspected of being a member of the communist party in the 1950s
7838493 my reporting conclusion was the role of frank had been hyped out of all proportion both by obama himself in his book and some others later he did not play a role in really shaping obama

7838498 when adults stop smoking you see immediate benefits in heart disease with impacts on cancer and lung diseases starting to appear a year or two later
7838499 we confirmed these results with a wide range of model reliability tests and sensitivity analyses to make sure that the findings we found were not a result of some unobserved third factor
7838500 for example including differences between california and the control states on a variety of risk factors did not materially affect the results
7838501 the methods in this study can be used to forecast future costs and will provide important additional means for validating program evaluations that previously did not exist

7838520 he is a bit of an egg and is always out drinking and smoking
7838521 im very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain england
7838522 its a huge honour and a terrific challenge for me at this stage of my international career
7838523 i have learned a great deal about leadership from playing under both michael and paul and fully appreciate the level of responsibility that comes with the job of captaining your country
7838524 my immediate priority will be this weeks fourth npower test and i will be devoting all my energies to ensuring that the team are properly prepared and play to their full potential starting on thursday
7838525 in choosing a new captain we were keen to identify a player who could lead the team in all three forms of cricket and bring fresh enthusiasm and ideas to the role of captain
7838526 kevin is a world class player who will command the respect of the dressing room and i am sure he will be looking to lead from the front and work closely with both the players and the coaching staff to bring england success in the future

7838528 its useless to cry over spilled milk we are looking ahead with eight races to go at the end well do the maths we just passed the half way point of the season so its important to always gain points
7838529 i was particularly disappointed after montreal magny cours and silverstone in each one of these races i had the possibility to win but because of one thing or another things didnt go the right way and i lost
7838530 its still early to make any forecasts for the championship considering that the first three drivers are only seven points apart the positions can change in a single race
7838531 why should i hurry i have a contract for 2009 which i will fulfill i always keep my deals
7838532 unfortunately ive had too many consecutive crashes and these have caused me to be afraid of the bike im not the same person i was at the beginning of the season
7838533 at this competitive level if you are a bit afraid of the bike and lose just a little bit of confidence then you are finished normally im not afraid of crashing and getting injured but now im in a crisis and im working towards getting rid of this fear
7838534 i must learn to understand where and when i can risks i must start going a bit slower
7838535 i put my hands up to that one i screwed up it was very close between several of us going down to the chicane and i just hadnt given myself enough room
7838536 ive apologised and i feel sorry for the team as theyve done a great job this weekend and i could have given them another good result
7838537 welcome to the world of winning the first of many well done
7838538 there have been various incidents this season that have happened when ive been in a position to fight for a victory
7838539 at the end i tried to put pressure on massa and hoped something would happen and it worked out that way
7838540 the team have kept pushing and im very glad to get this first win
7838541 its fantastic a great moment something ive been targeting for many years hopefully this is the first of many
7838542 i couldnt believe it when i saw felipes engine go and i was p2 so this is remarkable after the race in hockenheim and the big crash
7838543 we could have managed to do the race a little better and i was stuck behind alonso all the way to the second stop
7838544 im a little bit lucky with other people going all over the place
7838545 we have the speed in the race but if i cant get qualifying right then we will always end up like this
7838546 we just need to sort out the problems and then we will be fighting for wins

7838594 the old style message tended to be on energy conservation which was about being stingy or mean
7838595 these days we think of it as being energy efficient most of us dont want to use energy per se but we want the services
7838596 none of us wants to use electricity but we want our lights to work our computer our tv its the same with heat none of us wants to burn oil or gas just for the sake of it but we want to be warm
7838597 its really about having the heating on when you need it where you need it and at a temperature that is comfortable
7838598 theres a classic irish heat management system which is to overheat a room open the window and then end up back at square one
7838599 its not very accurate at regulating the temperature but it works on a comfort level and it is very effective
7838600 theres very little point in over heating a hall because actually youre only ever passing through and quite often you have a coat on because of the fact that youre opening the front door youre constantly losing heat anyway
7838601 people often dont know what rooms theyre going to use so it might be as well to leave the central heating system on but use a thermostatic valve on radiators to keep the temperature to a comfortable but efficient level
7838602 some people leave the immersion on all day because they want a shower when they come home from work thats like constantly re boiling a kettle except its a very large kettle

7838611 the bowery was very gritty when we first visited it
7838612 we were a bit shocked but we were also impressed that a contemporary art museum wanted to be there
7838613 ive made the decision to stand down as england captain
7838614 its the hardest decision ive ever had to make but also the easiest
7838615 the hardest because im giving away the job ive loved for the last five years one ive put my heart and soul into but also the easiest because my mind has told me to pack it in
7838616 i felt if i kept going my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this can prolong my career
7838617 i will carry on playing because i think there are a lot more runs in me
7838618 this decision will prolong my career im moving better than ever in the field so hopefully this decision will make my last few years a very exciting time
7838619 i will take a break from the game so i wont be playing at the oval
7838620 i wish i could have given it one more go ive had five unbelievable years felt the emotion of all the aspects of the captaincy but i feel its the right time to move forward with a new captain a new direction
7838621 weve lost three big series and just think it is time for someone else to lead the team in a different direction
7838622 i really do believe these could be the best years of my playing career and i can go on and score plenty of runs
7838623 it is a difficult job but a fantastic job but not many people get to do it which is a real privilege ive loved every minute of it
7838624 i think the decision came as a surprise to the players perhaps the one regret is that i didnt say it in front of all the players i hope they all respect me but i hope they can understand it is the right move for me
7838625 i just kind of knew that it would be the right time to step down if this series ended in defeat
7838626 obviously i am taking a break out of the game and then will come back and play for yorkshire this was an instinctive decision that this was the time to move on
7838627 i have some great memories leading out my country for the first time and of course everything that happened in 2005 in the ashes
7838628 whoever gets the job will need a little bit of time i was pretty average at the start and got better as time wore on
7838629 but the england team need a leader to guide them in the right direction
7838630 if the new man rings me up of course ill answer the questions but i wont be ringing the future captain of the country
7838631 i didnt aspire to be captain david graveney duncan fletcher and nasser hussain maybe had an inclination
7838632 to be a good captain you need good players and i have had really good players and good bowling attacks without them i wouldnt have lasted so long
7838633 ive tried to be me through the whole period of being england captain whether its in the dressing room or talking to you guys
7838634 but i havent been me at home and i guess thats why ive come to this decision i want to be me again
7838635 its a big disappointment not getting through until next year but theres no point carrying on when you know its time to go
7838636 michael led from the front and led with honesty and integrity every step of the way
7838637 he took the england captaincy to new heights michael was the best possible ambassador for the game and his record as captain speaks volumes for the character he instilled in the dressing room
7838638 paul feels this is the best decision in terms of benefiting the england team and his contribution to the team
7838639 we are extremely grateful for way paul led the one day side since last year
7838640 the selection committee is currently considering the squad and captain for the fourth test and natwest series these squads along with the captain will be announced tomorrow
7838641 i didnt think a split captaincy would work but it has in the dressing room
7838642 in an ideal world i think having one captain one voice is good for the team
7838643 i think it would help the new guy if he did all forms of the game
7838644 im looking forward to being the senior player with little chats i give to players and little bits of knowledge i can pass on
7838645 i just wont be stood at mid on waving my arms around and moving players around
7838646 we live in a country where we all become a little bit cynical and thought i was moving that way

7838682 we payed good money for danny and he has done well for us
7838683 he played 20 odd games in the premier league last season and scored three goals
7838684 he might have started last week if he hadnt been suspended
7838685 and im excited by a number of the players that weve got
7838686 he swanson has had a really really good pre season for the first time in his life i think hes done all the running hes run himself over the summer maybe he doesnt look it but hes a bit stronger and i think hes a little bit quicker
7838687 so he is a huge part of my plans but hes player in certain games that he might not be of any use to us
7838688 i think he will play i would think a lot of home games this season and i dont know so much away from home
7838689 they have taken monitors out of the dugout but if i had seen the replay of the first challenge on the keeper that would have stopped me throwing my toys out of the pram because i would have said fair enough i can see why he didnt give it a few things happened after that and then the penalty really got me to boiling point
7838690 i understand an offer has been made but neither club has as yet confirmed that or spoken with me
7838691 a number of premier league clubs have asked about ali and there is no shortage of interest so news of a bid is not at all surprising
7838692 it is now up to bolton but we would hope that they would allow ali the chance to move on
7838693 we have played two league games and we have taken three points
7838694 i couldnt have asked for a better tie especially going back so soon but hopefully ill come out a winner
7838695 its been a long time since i played for them but you still go back there with fond memories its an interesting tie for me
7838696 im sure nicky will enjoy it regardless im sure they will give him a good reception if he can get a goal or two and not celebrate then it will be a good day for him

7838699 and that no state without its consent shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the senate
7838700 the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people
7838701 well all the states do have equal suffrage because they still each have two senators

7838728 being nice costs nothing so why is that londoners so rarely take the time to see and acknowledge the people who share their city on public transport in the supermarket walking down the street we often hang our heads and avoid eye contact we can be slow to acknowledge our fellow londoners as people just like us but we can change we can make london into the open and friendly city it should be and that is what niceties tokens is all about niceties tokens is a campaign to make london a nicer place to live the concept is very simple it isnt about rewarding niceness its about engaging and acknowledging others the tokens themselves are just that tokens that are passed from person to person carrying their message with them recipients are directed to this website where they are invited to record their part in the tokens journey in a logbook we now have almost 1 000 niceties tokens in existence each token has potential to be passed round hundreds of people spreading the niceness message

7838732 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
7838733 1 the second amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes such as self defense within the home
7838734 we must protect our oppressive bureaucrats from the public they piss off
7838735 the second amendment says that individuals have the right to keep and bear arms without any restriction by government but that right also includes the right to self defense so if you are packing and start shooting up the joint you better hope your insurance is paid up because your life will quickly end by return fire learn to shoot straight and accurate and for crying out loud if you feel depressed angry frustrated homicidal suicidal or just ready to snap be responsible put the gun away and get some help

7838739 that the esv was selected by chinese christian leaders for publication with chinese cuv bible through our partnership with the british and foreign bible society since both the cuv and the esv are essentially literal bible translations they are ideally suited for a side by side comparison of the two languages what a wonderful thing it would be if thousands of people would learn english and chinese by reading the bible in side by side bilingual editions
7838740 it is a great joy for all of us at crossway bibles to have a small part in providing gods word to the church in china through the publication of the cuv esv bilingual bible
7838741 we pray that this is just the beginning of building partnerships with the church in china for the publication of bible resources that will help meet the needs of the chinese people

7838780 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
7838781 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder

7838927 there is no doubt that russia was preparing the military operation and also georgians were ready to accept this russia wont care for the lives of people but in this conflict the ossetians were lucky that russias interests coincided with theirs
7838928 considering that in the 1990s nato led by the u s bombed serbia for kosovo why couldnt russia intervene in the conflict between georgia and ossetia
7838929 the war in the caucasus is a disaster for the three participating nations this has never been the case among georgians russians and ossetians before the conflict broke out unfortunately the leaders of georgia and ossetia are only pawns in the bigger battle that is between the united states and russia
7838930 anybody who has seen the shelling of tskhinvali the capital of de facto south ossetia would agree with me and western politicians do nothing else than scold russia calling it an aggressor
7838931 there is a part of bigger caspian game in which most of the post soviet republics have been involved
7838932 if saakashvili abandons the project btc pipeline that runs from baku through tbilisi georgia to turkish ceyhan and then to europe avoiding russia moscow will forget the georgian separatist territories forever and will happily let the country join nato
7838933 if russia feels itself as the winner it will enhance the image and authority of vladimir putin as the national leader
7838934 however will that be good for russia not really russia has lost the war as it is obvious that the country chose its own way the way that will lead it to a deadlock
7838935 the general situation in the world came close to the brink of the cold war
7838936 georgia wanted to regain the breakaway republics as for russia it counted on a small victory to change the georgian government and force mikheil saakashvili and his allies out of the country
7838937 were hoping that with russias involvement in the conflict and victory over georgia they could finally acquire their independence

7838951 where a physicians negligence reduces or eliminates the patients prospects for achieving a more favorable medical outcome the physician has harmed the patient and is liable for damages
7838952 applying the proportional damages method the court must first measure the monetary value of the patients full life expectancy and the defendant must then be held liable only for the portion of that value that the defendants negligence destroyed

7838954 there is a lot of bid speculation around this now it started last week when some people were still sceptical but that has changed now
7838955 we believe one possible way of looking at this is that simon propertys stake is not a short term trading transaction and may eventually result in a takeover bid
7838956 neither company however has made comment either way on this we come to this potential conclusion because 1 liberty is one of the most expensive property companies in europe in our view 2 our economists believe that the dollar may rise further against the pound 3 simons management is well regarded by our us colleagues and industry 4 simon property has a strong balance sheet and may see strong value creation opportunities in libertys shopping centre portfolio as it could for example bring in international retailers and shopping centre knowledge 5 libertys portfolio is hard to replicate and simon may see this as the only way to get access to the uk and would be happy to pay a premium for that 6 we believe liberty needs a new strategy and simons move may fit in this
7838957 the groups management appears to be running the business for cash rather than profits which we believe is the correct strategy given awful housing market conditions in the uk
7838958 jury racial composition surprising lessons from experimental will be speaking on
7838959 our award was based on the fact that once they figured out they had no choice but to make the label change they chose to stall it in order to make as much as 229 million and we dont want them to stall we want them to tell us the truth and be responsible
7838960 229 million was the amount of money merck would gain if they put off changing the label
7838961 that was a number that they kept saying over and over when youre sitting there for five weeks and that number kept being repeated the number stuck in our minds
7838962 i dont know hes this big black guy you know he frightens me
7838963 we answered all the questions we tore the boxes of evidence apart and we looked at all the evidence we wont have to worry about this later because we did it right the first time
7838964 it was like having a 25 000 piece puzzle dumped on the table
7838965 we had about 34 postit pages i dont mean the little ones you stick on they were like two and a half feet by two feet and they were filled with all the information that we distilled from the testimony we took a long time to do that we took about a week just to get all these little building blocks there
7838966 we didnt start to do a straw vote right away and say

7839032 the men of experiment are like the ant they only collect and use the reasoners resemble spiders who make cobwebs out of their own substance but the bee takes the middle course it gathers its material from the flowers of the garden and field but transforms and digests it by a power of its own not unlike this is the true business of philosophy science for it neither relies solely or chiefly on the powers of the mind nor does it take the matter which it gathers from natural history and mechanical experiments and lay up in the memory whole as it finds it but lays it up in the understanding altered and digested therefore from a closer and purer league between these two faculties the experimental and the rational such as has never been made much may be hoped

7839043 it is invaluable to have an independent monitor who can swiftly question any adverse drug reactions or differences in illness and death rates between groups taking part in the clinical trials
7839044 parents also need to be made aware of the risks of adverse drug reactions when a child takes any medicine so that they can make informed decisions that balance those risks against the possible benefits the drug may provide their child
7839045 there is general agreement by pediatric health professionals regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical industry as well as politicians and parents that drug trials are essential in order to improve drug therapies
7839046 we are calling for all pediatric drug trials to include independent safety monitoring committees to ensure that this vital work is carried out in a way that minimizes risks and maximizes benefits for the children taking part

7839057 la vulnerabilidad de los controles fronterizos a reos terrestres y mar timos son el principal problema
7839058 hay zonas que parecen intocables como territorio liberado para el narcotr fico por ello los grupos internacionales comenzaron a ver el negocio aqu y naturalmente abrieron sus cocinas
7839059 el laboratorio de drogas que se logr desbaratar en ingeniero maschwitz propiedad de mexicanos fue un golpe importante pero apenas la punta del iceberg de un fen meno lamentable ya instalado en el pa s

7839066 all of you are aware of the serious nature of this years fire season and the issues faced by the agency in paying for fire suppression costs
7839067 at this time the only option for financing the shortfall is to use the agencys transfer authority
7839068 the unfortunate thing is that it is across the board
7839069 i recognize that this direction will have a significant effect on agency operations
7839070 however we must be in a position to protect life and property from wildfire and do so within the funds available to the agency
7839071 the fire season in montana and across the country is far from over not to mention we have good paying jobs to fund and projects around the state that need to be completed
7839072 funding should not be pulled from our states resources to help pay for fighting fires in california
7839073 the costs are high and they need to suppress these fires to protect people

7839300 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
7839301 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
7839302 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder

7839326 whats the matter with you why did you do that
7839327 there was a period when we talked about men and women doing the same things as the basis for equality and i dont think its ever as easy as that
7839328 what were actually seeing now is a different kind of equality that comes out of complementarity and a more complex set of negotiations based on peoples different circumstances
7839329 the indications are very strong that theres a much greater sense of convergence between men and women now in the work that theyre doing
7839330 very modern partner who is there 110 per cent for me

7839333 wider conception of what it means to care for children
7839334 previous studies on fathers were just looking at who was doing the cooking and the cleaning
7839335 while those are important aspects of care and domestic work its much wider than that the care of children doesnt just happen in the home it happens in the community
7839336 if we try to judge the care that fathers give by the standards used to study mothers and women we miss some of the creative ways that fathers are caring for children
7839337 women feel guilty for going back to work and men feel guilty if they take too much time off work
7839338 its going to take a few more generations for that to become more nuanced
7839339 men earn more per hour doing the same work as women do

7839370 students do not think education is of much relevance to their lives the job world is more complicated with every passing year and students cannot imagine what they will need because they no longer do much reading
7839371 the biggest problem is inept local and state leaders who are neither reformers nor educators
7839372 it is little wonder that students fail to see the wondrous opportunity of a free public education the system they face has a watered down 50 year old curriculum run by people who do not understand teaching as a result the high school students ive seen spend about 60 percent of their time socializing and only about 40 percent doing anything that remotely could be described as academic

7839659 linksys is conscious of the environment actively participating in waste take back programs and reducing hazardous wastes in our products we are now redoubling our efforts with the new packaging and have received energy star ratings on select routers modems gateways and adapters
7839660 this change is driven by our responsibility to better how we manage the environmental impact of our products and operations our overall use of paper is significantly less than what we were using but the cost of using recyclable products and bio degradable inks is about the same costs as what we were using we hope our efforts will encourage other companies to take a look at their packaging and do what they can to reduce resource usage and waste
