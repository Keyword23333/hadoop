950126 talked with a lot of returning gis who tell us the surge is working and were winning over there but the news media is not showing it
950127 its time to let the iraqi government take care of their own country
950128 the surge has worked but its time to say were coming out how many billions of dollars has been spent there i think about how that money could have been spent on things like improving our roads and putting people to work
950129 whether we can win this war or not weve been there for a long time already and its time to turn the country over to the iraqis
950130 our economy is hurting right now we need to take care of ourselves first
950131 we should have focused our efforts there rather than going into iraq
950132 no matter what were not going to win in iraq
950133 were fighting an idea and you cant win a war against an idea with guns and bombs
950134 im a believer of taking care of our own first

950137 theres no real consensus yet on which is the best health care reform to do other than we are committed to universality
950138 we believe that as you make health care more affordable people will be able to buy health care thats the basic principle how we get there is a matter of the legislative process
950139 it was important that that was stated quite clearly in the platform
950140 political tap dancing that attempts to mask his plans to expand government is what we expect from an inexperienced candidate like barack obama
950141 while there are differing approaches within the party about how best to achieve the commitment of universal coverage we stand united to achieve this fundamental objective through the legislative process

950183 theres been about a 20 percent decrease in sales at lunch people are doing away with larger lunches the 40 to 50 steaks theyre going down to lighter burgers

950188 is there enough infrastructure to send the ethanol to and blend with gasoline in as of yet untapped regions esp the southeast
950189 will mounting political pressure over food grain costs force the epa to lower the mandate
950190 in the long term the debacle in geneva marks a break of immense importance the rules governing trade will become more inscrutable because agreements between individual states will replace the framework that had been globally accepted up to now the wto will lose its influence as the referee in disputes the price will only gradually be perceived by businesses but it will be high the trade system is losing the dependability that exporters urgently require
950191 above all the failure of the wto talks reflects the changing power relations in the world gone are the days when the us and europe could set the tone and largely draw up the world trade agreements amongst themselves china and india took a tough stance they fight hard for their interests and only support free trade when it suits them the old industrial powers will slowly realize the bitter truth of this geneva was just a foretaste

950199 continuing strength in international markets coupled with healthy demand in the u s helped drive higher worldwide sales of semiconductors in june
950200 key demand drivers for semiconductors especially personal computers which account for 40 of semiconductor sales and mobile phones which drive about 20 percent of demand continued to show double digit unit growth
950201 emerging markets are a major factor in driving worldwide semiconductor sales
950202 pc unit sales in emerging markets are expected to grow by 19 more than double the growth rate in developed markets this year in 2008 developing countries with sales of over 153 million units will account for half of worldwide pc sales in mobile phones developing countries are expected to account for 66 of total worldwide unit sales of over 1 3 billion up from 61 last year the emergence of large middle class populations in china india eastern europe and latin america has more than offset the effects of slower growth in the u s economy we expect that demand for consumer electronic products in these new markets will continue to outpace growth in developed markets for the next several years
950203 inventory for the industry is in balance with minor excess in a few product sectors
950204 advances in semiconductor technology continue to deliver huge benefits to consumers as semiconductor devices deliver higher performance and increased functionality at lower cost
950205 at the same time rapid price declines for microchips tend to mask the real growth of the industry the cost of 1 gigabit of dram has declined by 43 during the past year while the price of 2 gigabits of nand flash has declined by 61 in the last 12 months lower prices enable increased memory content in consumer devices micron estimates that the memory content of the average pc will increase at least 50 this year while the memory content in the average cell phone will increase by more than 150
950206 there are clear cost advantages to installing solar panels compared to having transmission lines particularly in areas that are not easily accessible
950207 moreover solar cells are easier to manage and maintain than other sources such as wind or nuclear
950208 polysilicon prices are as high as 200 per kilogram since silicon which forms the base substrate for most solar modules is currently experiencing heavy shortage
950209 the dearth of raw materials is preventing many manufacturing plants from operating at 100 percent capacity driving up the prices of solar modules and hence deterring potential investors

950222 reasonably well albeit with less momentum than in the recent past
950223 ultimately the real economy will recover from this crisis although it may get worse before it gets better
950224 this is great news but only if people have the finances in place to really enjoy their post career years
950225 with more and more people reaching 90 and beyond and with 90 becoming the new 70 in terms of healthy ageing it has never been more necessary for the industry and individuals to understand the true cost of modern retirement
950226 as a rule of thumb most pensions will pay you an annual income of 5 of the amount of money youve saved
950227 at whatever age you start saving save half your age in income so if you start a pension at the age of 30 save 15 if youre 40 you need to put away 20
950228 the combination of falling employment confidence and rising inflation expectations is a lethal cocktail for consumer spending
950229 the survey results suggest that spending growth is likely to slow sharply in the months ahead if people dont feel safe in their job and high prices are putting incomes under pressure then demand for discretionary purchases will naturally slow
950230 the survey shows that consumers are bracing themselves for the worst when it comes to the squeeze on the household purse
950231 should the monetary policy committee be forced to increase rates over the months ahead then at least this will come as no surprise to consumers and limit any negative reaction
950232 i wonder if we can knit while we hula hoop
950233 everyone knows the japanese dont wear shoes in the house
950234 but i had no idea there would be so many instances outside the home where i would be asked to take my shoes off
950235 bare feet are considered unsanitary and impolite so i was always careful to wear socks but then i worried whether they were socially culturally or fashionably acceptable the worst of course is when after a long day i take off my shoes in a restaurant and theres this big hole around the toe very embarrassing
950236 this is because so many japanese traditionally suffer from foot trouble
950237 flat feet for example are rampant among men and one in every three women over the age of 20 suffer from some degree or symptom of a condition known as hallux valgus
950238 when the big toe is deformed and is twisted inward
950239 young women who come in dragging their feet in pain the combination of high heels and long commutes plus working 8 to 10 hours a day in air conditioned offices are murderous on the feet
950240 im out there stomping the streets five or six hours a day and i look upon these things as comrades in arms

950247 we told the boys we would support them if they wanted to stay or if they wanted to come back and they said they wanted to come back

950249 whats my secret i may look tough on the outside but really i scream like a girl
950250 we feel that it is consistent with the governments approach that it wants to listen and learn from the experiences of people in this country
950251 we will continue to work with the energy companies and others to make sure that we provide help including social tariffs for those groups
950252 protecting those who struggle to heat their homes is an absolute priority for the government

950294 hire a pro get a font you love and stick with it dont change fonts over time at least not often the right font becomes your handwriting
950295 use the same font set throughout your entire slide presentation and use no more than two complementary fonts e g arial and arial bold serif font are said to be easier to read at small point sizes but for on screen presentations the serifs tend to get lost due to the relatively low resolution of projectors

950310 combined with our existing cash reserves that ensures we will have more than sufficient funding on hand to continue launching falcon 1 and develop falcon 9 and dragon there should be absolutely zero question that spacex will prevail in reaching orbit and demonstrating reliable space transport for my part i will never give up and i mean never
950311 have you ever been so stressed out that you crocheted a series of small gnomes
950312 being involved with the olympic handover celebrations and playing in front of buckingham palace to thousands of people is going to be amazing

950314 this will truly be one of the most memorable events that we have ever performed at and we are so happy to be involved
950315 he touched me it was nothing horrific but it could have been
950316 as an adult you look back at all the details you didnt understand then now i know what he wanted its frightening
950317 it was the start of a sexual assault there were three of us and youd think thered have been safety in numbers but we were so frightened of him wed have done anything
950318 he made us stand on a wall said stay there and went looking for somewhere to take us
950319 then he came back and tried to get us into the house he was desperate and really agitated
950320 we managed to attract the attention of some people at a bus stop and ran away i thank god those people were there because we were so scared
950321 the finest oral argument we have heard in the history of this competition
950322 there is considerably less transmission of the infection within trust hospitals
950323 this is a reflection of the nature of the illness that can reoccur in some patients for several months depending on the patients primary condition and whether there is a need to prescribe further antibiotic treatment
950324 all of these patients have low levels of immunity to infection we are also seeing an increase in the number of patients developing symptoms within 48 hours of admission to hospital which indicates that they were infected when admitted
950325 we havent changed the direction of the development were making the ps3 version first and then porting to the 360 later

950330 you know were going to take good care of our guys so were pretty conservative with this stuff the bad injury was the acl
950331 this isnt going to be easy its going to be a dogfight and i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
950332 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate
950333 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
950334 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
950335 im excited its good to have him back in the house
950336 the referees have done an awesome job of making calls
950337 there are balls and strikes sometimes it goes over the plate and sometimes it doesnt
950338 we were all warned about being off plane i sped up and so did theoret but then he went off plane again
950339 i hit a roller and got a little air under the right sponson
950340 i had to leave the pit box i was afraid he was going to punch me in the neck
950341 carl said what would you do if you thought we would get the track cleaned off and keep running
950342 the enormity of what were doing just blows me away
950343 he said he felt good this is the first step just the fact that he felt good throwing and didnt have any discomfort thats a great sign
950344 just hit the glove and get used to throwing again
950345 hes been doing a lot of shoulder conditioning a lot of stuff in the weight room a lot of core work and a lot of leg work hes working probably two to three hours per day doing a lot of different things
950346 when bryan gets an infield hit its probably not because hes done something right
950347 the f word a fianc e shares her story from
950348 you know the very first time you had a warm chocolate fudge brownie with ice cream sprinkles whipped
950349 well its not really a case of is there any chance its the fact that we are privately we are i mean we have to really keep it private as hes married and he does have kids
950350 i spoke to him yesterday in the hospital his two fingers are pretty mashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it in the story
950351 we had a little heart to heart the week before when he bought a brand new motorcycle and i said dude
950352 mr mac is responding well to treatment and will be released soon we asked that his privacy and that of his family is respected while he gets well
950353 they had to fight to get to me to get to me is like getting to the wizard of oz they had to prove themselves they had to walk down the yellow brick road
950354 but the show isnt about just seeing if i could find someone to work for me its about people chasing their dreams i dont say it in a cocky way but i take pride in being one of the best at doing what i do
950355 its all part of my strategic plan to take over tv
950356 youve got your superstars youve got your celebrities and then youve got your people who i call infamous like who i know
950357 shes got a look that a lot of younger girls liked and copied but she has no talent im sure paris would tell you that herself the timing was right for her a lot of younger women looked up to her
950358 shes a very sweet nice girl but thats it then you put a full stop its over
950359 the number of reality shows is terrible isnt it do you know what its like i said to ozzy people will just have go get over it i havent seen most of them ill watch maybe five minutes of something and check it out
950360 im totally amazed at how shameless people are they will repeat something thats been done over and over again and act as if its unique
950361 i think that the younger generation thinks all they have to do is get on tv and act a bit crazy and things will happen for them
950362 theyve got it wrong because you need to have a talent to get really famous
950363 theyve been keeping the relationship quiet for months and trying to pass each other off as just good friends
950364 but theyve decided it isnt a fling its for life so they want to make their romance public dina is still working on the date of the party but its looking like towards the end of the year
950365 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate
950366 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody thank god and evidently has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
950367 there are certain times during the course of a season where exceptions should be made for night games on weekends
950368 well see it makes sense to me it would help the situation from a winning and losing standpoint
950369 but then it started getting a little more consistent when he finished up
950370 whats important is how it feels monday if it feels fine we can step it up and get him ready to pitch
950371 now all of a sudden a team wants me im pretty excited about that
950372 the explosion of jellyfish populations scientists say reflects a combination of severe overfishing of natural predators like tuna sharks and swordfish rising sea temperatures caused in part by global warming and pollution that has depleted oxygen levels in coastal shallows
950373 jellyfish relatives of the sea anemone and coral that for the most part are relatively harmless in fact are the cockroaches of the open waters the ultimate maritime survivors who thrive in damaged environments and that is what they are doing

950378 the main difference between contemporary anthropology and my work is that i claim that all cultures scapegoat and victimize someone while it is fashionable to say that only western culture did that if one talks about ritual killing in the amazon it is seen as a pure fancy of western prejudice
950379 claims that you are doing away with the object and in some sense you are scapegoating it
950380 i do not see why god cannot be compatible with science if one believes in god one also believes in objectivity a traditional belief in god makes one a believer in the objectivity of the world i still operate within a traditional epistomology which considers things as real and sees god as the guarantor of that reality therefore i do not understand why it should pose a problem to discuss my theory within a scientific framework
950381 readers do not realize how unphilosophical i am and they dont realise the fact that i have been guided by the idea of contributing to a science of human relationships always starting from actual and real human relationships moving away from the myth of the all powerful subject
950382 to postulate the a priori truth of religion from the start your reasoning would have a far weaker apologetic value the mimetic theory has an apologetic value in terms of christianity only if you assume all restrictions of knowledge of the scientific attitude
950383 in his view we have to renounce the inner violence of cultural progress as conceived in modern western philosophy to criticize and to discriminate are acts of expulsion of division of scapegoating
950384 there should be some critique of the subject it does not have to be total negation i have to say that personally polemic does not trouble me much if i am treated polemically i will respond accordingly it is true that it is a phenomenon of doubles but i think it preferable to total silence if you do not discriminate you cannot distinguish and to start thinking you have to learn to distinguish the more we speak about dialogue in our time the less we seem to practise it being polemical means acknolwedging the existence of the other as one who does not think like me but going back to serres position it is clear that we are still in a critical world there are aspects of our culture that we cannot transcend we are circumscribed by our limitations but ultimately i dont see this as an issue of great importance

950400 and when we eat its very poorly because our situation is very difficult here and i can tell you this we and our children and our grandchildren will have to eat each other when were hungry
950401 twenty years ago the international institutions told us that there was no sense you know in producing grain
950402 we better buy them and bring them from outside in the last two decades grain producers went broke
950403 as bad as wars are its even more dangerous not to have enough food
950404 we believe in this government that the first thing we need to do is provide food for our population
950405 its a global response and from our own part were scaling up our support for agricultural development particularly in africa
950406 i wish id thought of suing when my university recruited me for history and then i flunked

950417 there was a lot of shouting and pushing people fell down and could not get up they just suffocated
950418 the police did not allow people to step back meanwhile people started coming down from above shouting go back go back
950419 since the police did not allow the people to go back this tragedy happened
950420 i think weve emerged at the end of this conference with some quite surprising results a surprising level of sheer willingness to stay together and a surprising level of agreement about what might be necessary to make that happen
950421 for all that the details of the covenant proposal still need a great deal of clarification nonetheless there is a following wind for that there is also a wide degree of agreement about the need for moratoria on both sides where divisive actions are concerned

950428 temperatures are so high much of drilling equipment would melt and joins would not work anymore
950429 the high temperature of the venting is especially interesting as this mid ocean ridge does not spread very rapidly
950430 so one can presume that this portion of the south mid atlantic ridge is in a very magmatic phase and has been for a few years
950431 the explanation could be that theres lot of magma but after a few more years of high temperatures its going to get to the point where it will be embarrassing how much magma there needs to be to maintain them for that long
950432 if that turns out to be the case then we will have taken down some very very holy grails

950680 this agreement presents an excellent opportunity for emission reductions beyond that which the texas commission on environmental quality tceq would have required
950681 the greenhouse gas reductions 50 are particularly significant because the tceq does not consider carbon dioxide a pollutant and does not regulate or restrict carbon emissions
950682 we applaud nrg committing to offset a significant part of its co 2 emissions from the limestone 3 plant co 2 is the gas that scientists tell us is the principal cause of global warming
950683 offsets such as the projects that nrg has committed to invest in are a low cost way to get the large reductions in greenhouse gases that are necessary to prevent catastrophic impacts of global warming and nrg has established a precedent for other electricity companies to follow
950684 the limestone expansion is part of our program to invest in texas with a balanced portfolio of nuclear gas wind and coal
950685 we have appreciated working with environmental defense fund and the tcacc to bring this additional power to texas in an environmentally responsible manner and dramatically lower overall average emissions including co 2
950686 we commend nrg for their willingness to work with the citizens of texas to produce a plant which adds power while reducing emissions from the site
950687 with its commitment to undertake a utility scale solar project in texas either on its own or with other electric generators nrg can help lower the cost of this emerging and abundant clean energy resource and continue their efforts to advance technologies to reverse the threat of global warming
950688 nrgs new build portfolio is focused on helping to meet the growing energy needs of texas with significantly less emissions per megawatt hour of power produced
950689 these projects also include investments in wind and natural gas generation and ultimately bridge to zero carbon zero emission nuclear power collectively the carbon intensity of these new repowering projects will be 70 less than the current average in texas by working with tcacc and environmental defense fund and implementing the steps listed in these agreements we will reduce our carbon intensity even further it is an important step in our efforts to be a leader in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions

950725 in een huis van 9 ton zet je niet drie studenten dat geld rendeert veel beter op een spaarrekening
950726 panden die worden aangekocht door particulieren en voor veel te veel geld in gedeeltes worden doorverkocht vaak zonder eigen sanitair maar wel met hypothecaire plichten juridische wespennesten zijn deze verenigingen van huurders omdat de verkoop van een klein deel van een pand op papier een hels karwei is er heeft namelijk geen kadastrale splitsing kunnen plaatsvinden deze particulieren zijn de nieuwe huisjesmelkers die onwetende ouders afzetten voor een ogenschijnlijk te overzien bedrag
950727 bij elke oversluiting wordt bovendien flink aan de oude en nieuwe bewoner verdiend gemeenten is het een doorn in het oog omdat ze het gebruiksbesluit omzeilen en dus kamers kunnen aanbieden beneden de maatschappelijk bepaalde minimumeisen voor huurders om nog maar te zwijgen over wat er gebeurt als een of meerdere van je huisgenoten hun betalingsverplichting niet kunnen nakomen
950728 vandaar dat veel mensen hebben geklaagd over de zorgbijdrage die in nederland wordt ingehouden en inkomensafhankelijk is men voelt zich door de kwaliteit van de zorg bij de seguridad social genoodzaakt zich bij te verzekeren en daardoor betaalt men dubbel
950729 de zorg in de particuliere sector is juist uitstekend meestal beter dan in nederland
950730 mensen vallen vaak om van verbazing dat ze in spanje direct geholpen en geopereerd kunnen worden
950731 daardoor maak je in het begin op papier geen winst ook al draai je goed alleen hebben de banken daar niet altijd oog voor
950732 dan nog is het problematisch vaak wordt het inkomen gemiddeld over de laatste drie jaar n gemaximeerd tot het laatste kalenderjaar als je dus het laatste jaar een grote afschrijving hebt gedaan zit dat je hypotheekaanvraag behoorlijk in de weg
950733 geldverstrekkers bundelen pakketjes hypotheken en verkopen die weer door aan investeerders met de hypotheekcrisis is in die praktijk de klad gekomen vooral risicovolle leningen waar die aan ondernemers onder vallen kunnen niet worden doorverkocht banken zijn daarom erg kritisch geworden aan de poort en als ze al iemand accepteren doen ze dat tegen hoge rente of strenge voorwaarden
950734 bij de een kon ik omdat ik zelfstandige ben nog geen ton lenen net voldoende voor een parkeerplaats de ander wilde alleen gaan rekenen als ik accountantsverklaringen van de afgelopen drie jaar zou overleggen ik laat mijn boeken wel controleren door een boekhouder maar niet door een accountant dat kost me anders zon 2000 per jaar dat vond ik wat overdreven en bij de bank kreeg ik te horen dat ze me graag een hypotheek zouden verschaffen als ik geen zelfstandige was geweest
950735 al was het ook nog lastig een verhuurder in het duurdere segment te vinden die een ondernemer accepteert
950736 maar als dat geen optie is dan gaat kopen niet lukken
950737 bedrijfspanden zijn lastig te financieren net als woon winkelpanden een hypotheek voor een woonhuis is goed te krijgen mits je alle spullen maar op orde hebt werk daarom met zo recent mogelijke gegevens overtuig de boekhouder dat hij geen uitstel voor de belastingaangifte moet aanvragen als je die nodig hebt voor je hypotheek
950738 als ondernemer wil je niet iemand hebben die continu over je schouder mee zit te kijken
950739 daar hebben de handelsbanken nogal een handje van ze kunnen wellicht een tiende procent gunstigere rente geven dan traditionele woonhuisfinanciers maar ze stellen geregeld als eis dat je als ondernemer ieder halfjaar met je billen bloot gaat en cijfers inlevert bij woonhuisfinanciers is de toelating wat strenger maar die kijken n keer of je in het plaatje past en stellen daarna geen vragen meer dat is op termijn een stuk voordeliger
950740 niet alleen je hypotheek ook je rekening courant en verzekeringen lopen dan allemaal via n loket daarmee heeft de bank meer macht over je onderneming dan je eigenlijk zou willen
950741 ondernemingspanden vormen een hoog risico voor de bank dus zijn ze streng in de acceptatie en rekenen ze een hoge rente zon 6 7 bovendien financieren ze vaak maximaal 80 van de waarde
950742 geldverstrekkers helpen alleen grotere bedrijven die financieel erg sterk staan janssen kan momenteel alleen een nieuwe loods kopen als hij eigen geld inlegt of elders geld leent
950743 het successierecht voor buitenlanders niet residenten is hier echt heel hoog
950744 aangezien dit in de praktijk moeilijk controleerbaar of jaarlijks wisselend is wordt vaak voor de meest gunstige fiscale regels gekozen
950745 over deze inkomsten betaalt u inkomstenbelasting in nederland het verdrag ter voorkoming van dubbele belasting regelt dat u over die inkomsten niet nogmaals in spanje belasting hoeft te betalen
950746 tot 1 januari jongstleden gold voor mensen met een relatief groot vermogen en lage inkomsten dat de belastingdruk in spanje hoger was zij konden beter fiscaal resident blijven in nederland dit kwam door de combinatie van 18 vermogenswinstbelasting en vermogensbelasting terwijl in nederland alleen 1 2 vermogensrendementsheffing is verschuldigd de spaanse regering wil echter de vermogensbelasting met terugwerkende kracht per 1 januari 2008 afschaffen voor mensen die alleen inkomen genieten is de belasting op arbeid pensioeninkomen in spanje in algemene zin lager dan in nederland
950747 residenten betalen daarentegen na 5 jaar in eerste lijn bijna geen successierecht meer de huwelijkspartner is dan in veel regios voor 99 van de erfenis vrijgesteld en betaalt nauwelijks successiebelasting meer
950748 de heffing loopt in dat laatste geval op tot extreme tarieven tot 68 bij grotere vermogens zelfs tot 81 je bent in spanje welhaast verplicht om te trouwen
950749 gehuwden betalen maximaal 34 en als ze 5 jaar resident zijn zelfs dat niet meer
950750 aan zowel inkomsten als vermogensbelasting ben je dan voor je huis circa 0 4 kwijt dat is echter nog te overzien residenten betalen in praktijk helemaal niets aan belasting dankzij hoge vrijstellingen
950751 je moet zorgen dat het netto bezit in spanje zo laag mogelijk is heb je een huis van 3 ton komt de hypotheek in mindering op de waarde de nabestaande betaalt alleen spaanse belasting over het netto vermogen n spanje

950777 there are other republics that were part of the old soviet regime that are also prime for development for instance in belorussia or belarus which also has a reputation of excellence in oncology research we are realizing that we are definitely losing time by not going there because belorussia and russia are considered one state in terms of political views and regulations we would be able to operate there more easily

950846 we have no evidence that any intrinsic moral community exists
950847 the truth value of moral observations dont explain why the observation was made
950848 in considering whether moral principles can help explain observations it is therefore important to note an ambiguity in the word
950849 that this act is wrong is evidence that causing unnecessary suffering is wrong
950850 guns are designed to kill people gt killing people is morally wrong gt guns are morally wrong

950902 last fall one of my high school teachers who ironically i now sit beside in many of my seminary classes pointed out to me that i like a significant majority of my classmates listed john 3 16 as my favorite bible verse in our yearbook
950903 what hes doing is telling jesus that the pharisees the very people who want to see jesus killed actually do know who he is
950904 if you find jesus response confusing youre not the only one jesus responds by telling nicodemus that the pharisees who criticize his ministry are doing so because they are not born again
950905 jesus is referring to baptism but hes not saying that a person must be baptized in order to be saved rather it has to do with what baptism represents the water itself does nothing but it does represent the cleansing or purification of the heart carried out by the holy spirit

950916 this is a place where the niv has offered a very poor translation of the hebrew
950917 rises in market premiums and a relatively benign claims experience over the last 18 months mean that for the first time in seven years we see a real prospect of falling underlying loss ratios in our core uk business

950951 with the nowadays conventional commercial use of nuclear energy the uran sources will be finished in about 60 years
950952 you can put it also like this it seems to be cheaper to built breeders than to employ more costly exploitation methods
950953 in short if mankind is unable to deal with this rapid expansion it probably doesnt matter how we blow up our planet
950954 thus the worlds present measured resources of uranium 5 5 mt in the cost category somewhat below present spot prices and used only in conventional reactors are enough to last for over 80 years
950955 seawater up to 4000 mt which would be uneconomic to extract in the foreseeable future

951648 my mother was truly a victorian lady and i think shed be in total shock total shock as would my father and i think my daughter is to an extent but shes grown up with it so i think shes learned to divide it away
951649 he had to be funny for me to like him he had a very dry humour but everyone in my family is funny melissa is funny my grandson is funny my father was funny my sister is funny shes a lawyer but shes funny i think its dna you cant develop a sense of humour
951650 were very complementary shes not a comedienne shes much more of an interviewer so we werent competing
951651 no because she grew up knowing i never would even as a child she was never the butt the boyfriends were never brought into it i think she worried a little when she got divorced because i was so angry and i would have gone out and absolutely demolished my ex son in law on stage and thats the only time she said to me im pleading with you be careful she said itll just be harder on me so i didnt
951652 diane keaton was very angry with me which was disappointing especially as i wrote a chapter for her stupid book on clowns for free tommy lee jones very angry whats her name the heavy one in titanic kathy bates she took it very seriously cher took it very seriously
951653 because qvc when i started was disgusting it was the lowest if your career was in the toilet you went on qvc
951654 i will never be done if i look in a mirror and i get very depressed i will probably do something right now im fine but who knows one day i might wake up and go oh god i cant look at myself
951655 you could see the women who had done something surgical and the women who hadnt
951656 you see thats interesting because i bet shes going to be averse to it were very opposite she wears very little makeup she wears casual clothes she lives in a very pretty house but totally different from how i live very casual living i always say to her when i die sell everything youre not going to want 130 service plates and 240 finger bowls and 1 000 wine glasses

951662 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
951663 they went crazy realising karadzic was making a fool of them
951664 hes been spreading it for 12 years through his friends now hes making it personally it would have been morally reprehensible and illegal to do such a thing we made no deal

951680 cela veut dire arr ter de se concentrer uniquement sur les capacit s de leader de gordon brown et trouver des id es qui r tabliront la coalition qui a permis au labour de gagner trois lections
951681 regrettable qu un moment o le parti tente de se rassembler les amis de tony blair essaient de cr er des tensions internes avec leurs fuites de m mos et leurs attaques personnelles contre gordon
951682 tony devrait dire ses amis darr ter de cr er des probl mes
951683 i believe that beijings olympics are now facing real threats from terrorist attacks
951684 i think the olympics are the most important international sports event in four years
951685 and its the biggest focus of the international media in four years so this might draw some attention from terrorist groups
951686 the threat remains moderate but slightly elevated because of the olympics
951687 the chinese have been on these people a long time
951688 the surveillance system deployed by china for the olympics which includes key pieces of western technology is the most comprehensive and sophisticated surveillance system ever
951689 properly used it will definitely increase security at the olympics and western companies will have contributed to that security
951690 whereas the legacy of previous olympics was sports stadiums the legacy of the beijing olympics will be a high tech police state
951691 quand vous arrivez une chelle si petite chaque millim tre compte
951692 ce matin jai entendu une explosion ensuite quand jai voulu aller au bureau la rue seman tait bloqu e cest en face du bangchen hotel je ne sais pas sil sagit du poste de police ou du restaurant les rumeurs parlent effectivement de 16 ou 18 policiers tu s la rue est rouverte d sormais
951693 on a juste vu qu la gare il y avait beaucoup de policiers en armes et de militaires mais personne ne nous a dit quoi que ce soit
951694 ciblant des points n vralgiques li s aux jeux olympiques
951695 it wasnt this divisive when i grew up protesters shout french people get off our territory at our meetings flemish authorities refuse to give contracts to our french speaking schoolteachers they give flemish children here 179 euros a year for school trips and other expenses french children 68 euros if we want subsidies we are obliged to stock our library with 75 percent of the books in flemish but its ridiculous to have a flemish library in a mostly french speaking town
951696 in belgium the two cultures know very little about each other because they speak different languages there are singers known in one part not in the other television is different newspapers books
951697 there are six million dutch speakers and theyre angry about francophone influence but meanwhile they care nothing about the influence of english and anglo culture
951698 so its not rational weve forgotten our true cultural history in the 15th century bruges was the most vibrant city outside italy because it was full of foreigners then it was antwerp when the foreigners left bruges today the national movement in flanders is in complete denial of the past
951699 french dominated and it would have meant they would need to learn flemish educated flemish spoke in french but then the electoral system changed and allowed everyone to vote and more power went to the non french speaking flemish middle and lower classes
951700 i dont think it will but for the first time i really believe belgium could disappear
951701 flemish people today revere their writers because for them language is a symbol of independence
951702 i was shocked that my french speaking counterparts didnt know their neighbors
951703 put it to me this way flanders has nothing in common with holland except language and the flemish and walloons have everything in common except language but theres almost no communication between the two communities except through rock music which everybody sings in english and sports which transcend everything
951704 flemish culture is dynamic today flemish intellectuals are fluent in dutch and french and english and they arent part of the separatist movement many of them come to live in brussels because we here are the last belgians most people in flanders now say im flemish not im belgian its as if flemish speaking belgium wanted to leave europe and if they werent poor walloons would probably want to secede too
951705 all cultural movements have a history and the nationalist movement in flanders started long ago when left wing liberals from french speaking belgium promoted flemish as the language of the people in flanders
951706 they believed promoting the dutch language would help educate the poor who could learn french afterward
951707 they put me in a dutch catholic school i learned french in the street i write in dutch but refuse to publish only in dutch so i translate myself into french but its difficult to have a public on both sides flemish writers want to be published in holland francophones in france
951708 its gotten to the point that landlords want to rent only to flemish speakers
951709 i used to hire flemish workers for building projects in francophone areas but now french workers need to speak dutch to be hired by flemish bosses at my bank documents are in flemish and if you ask for them in french youre told theyre out
951710 years ago many flemish went to places like li ge in wallonia to work and never got the reciprocity francophones in the flemish parts of belgium now want even today there is still a feeling among francophones that french is so important they dont need to learn dutch
951711 its a moral question does a culture have a right to stand up for itself more than that do unity and nationhood take priority over ones culture thats not just an issue for belgians but everyone
951712 yo no me acuerdo pero bebo dice que toco desde que ten a tres a os
951713 un tono muy complicado imag nate hasta los cinco o seis a os la segu a tocando tocaba tambi n otras cosas pero en casa todo el mundo la ped a
951714 hubo un momento que pens que nunca m s nos bamos a ver
951715 yo no ten a forma de viajar y ya l hab a hecho otra vida se hab a casado hab a tenido hijos y eso era un dolor grande fue un milagro cuando nos pudimos ver 18 a os despu s en nueva york

951718 donde fue realmente emocionante fue en calle 54 cuando est bamos tocando los dos a m no me interesaba tocar quer a o rlo a l me parec a que est bamos en casa como hac a muchos a os
951719 yo quer a hacer un trabajo con sinf nica como tributo espiritual a las v ctimas del katrina

951721 cl sicos cubanos tocados como yo los siento a mi manera ah est n en una sola cosa juan sebastian bach chopin art tatum bebo vald s lecuona yo el tratado de la mano izquierda en ese concierto pienso yo que est para estudiarlo
951722 generalmente los pianistas improvisamos con la mano derecha se me ocurri invertir los t rminos cantar con la izquierda y acompa ar con la derecha a veces la mano izquierda cumple la funci n de ambas melod a y acompa amiento mientras la derecha toca otra cosa y parece que son dos pianos
951723 tienes que jug rtela a menudo toco cosas que si las escucho despu s grabadas no s c mo las hice el piano es mi gran confesor
951724 compongo canciones y nadie lo sabe canciones complicadas que nunca se hab an cantado y que nada tienen que ver con el estilo de irakere
951725 creo que represent un nuevo camino para la m sica popular bailable cubana y el
951726 ser hijo de bebo me dio la oportunidad desde muy ni o de escuchar en vivo a los grandes pianistas lecuona peruch n frank emilio eran amigos de bebo y todos iban a mi casa uno aprende escuchando pero se aprende m s cuando escuchas y puedes ver lo que est n haciendo y yo lo vi vi a lecuona tocando su malague a s c mo pon a las manos su gesticulaci n su temperamento

951732 para remediar el da o que me hizo ese expolio me promet entonces que lo volver a a escribir pero fui incapaz de hacerlo
951733 la magia de la novela consiste en reflejar algo de uno mismo pero enmarc ndolo en una historia universal
951734 y mi familia inmediata result milagrosamente intacta pero pas mucho miedo y estoy rodeado de gente que perdi brutalmente a sus seres queridos
951735 antes de convertirse en un genocidio los acontecimientos de 1994 son experiencias individuales subjetivas
951736 por qu un buen d a se agarra un machete para matar a unos vecinos de otra etnia pero con los que se viv a en armon a
951737 hay que inventar la verdad para que por fin brote
951738 la familia de mi t a fue aniquilada aunque ella sobrevivi
951739 para desatascar las c rceles su asesino fue como otros muchos liberado antes de tiempo regres al pueblo y acudi a visitar a mi t a para pedirle perd n
951740 hay tal abismo entre mi pasado y mi presente que a veces pienso que no soy yo mismo
951741 es como una estrella de rock no tiene sustancia y me asusta es demasiado de izquierdas los asesores de ted kennedy y de jimmy carter le est n llevando la campa a
951742 por qu obama se convirti al cristianismo justo antes de entrar en pol tica en este pa s si eres musulm n no puedes ser presidente
951743 podemos hacer discursos y declaraciones pero lo importante es dialogar con el pueblo americano y obama lo ha rechazado
951744 responder a vuestras preguntas y comentarios e incluso a vuestros insultos bromea para eso estamos
951745 no trabajo para un partido ni para un grupo de inter s trabajo para vosotros y para el pa s al que amo
951746 quiere aumentar el tama o del gobierno y subir los impuestos

951748 the most painful thing for us is when we see people selling up and leaving
951749 each person who leaves makes it harder for those who remain
951750 i dont think i could survive a third forced move
951751 because that means they trade in pigs like we do
951752 an albanian neighbour joked to me recently that the power supply was more reliable before independence what kind of country is this without electricity
951753 somewhere over the rainbow blue birds fly and the dreams that you dreamed of dreams really do come true ooh ooooh
951754 the procurement has been substantially delayed and this schedule introduces more delays
951755 we need procurement decisions in 2008 to keep to the service introduction date
951756 we really believe we have come up with a contracting profile that responds to the commissions concerns and that we could negotiate a final contract much sooner
951757 if you tell me how many bids we are going to receive for each work package i can give you an idea of how quickly we can conclude the negotiations
951758 but the commissions rules on this are very clear and i do not see at this point how we can save a lot of time from the current schedule
951759 later as it leaves the supercluster it should lose exactly the same amount of energy but if dark energy causes the universe to stretch out at a faster rate the supercluster flattens out in the half billion years it takes the microwave to cross it thus the wave gets to keep some of the energy it gained as it entered the supercluster
951760 with this method for the first time we can actually see what supervoids and superclusters do to microwaves passing through them
951761 dean pirkul was selected not only because of his leadership of the school but also because of the accomplishments he has achieved therein
951762 he has drawn an exceptional staff and created influential programs which have attracted high quality students having him as a resource is a big plus for the residents of collin county
951763 our goals are to be a nationwide leader in management research and education and to produce graduates capable of business leadership on a worldwide basis the universitys location in this region a living laboratory of vibrant business activity is important to our success
951764 were proud to have earned the mark of quality from naeyc and to be recognized for our commitment to reaching the highest professional standards
951765 the accreditation lets families in our community know that children in our program are getting the best care and early learning experiences possible
951766 the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the beginning we called the shots
951767 the number of new corporate blogs among the companies forrester tracks has dropped from 36 in 2006 to just three in 2008
951768 how about something that shows the emotional bond between the pet and owner
951769 we trying a new management strategy we talk to each other
951770 the reason we are tapping influential bloggers like yourself is because
951771 in summary a successful social media strategy is one that involves two elements listening and participating
951772 social building relationships that encouraging learning from each other and together that might be friend to friend or customer to brand manager
951773 dispirited unmotivated underappreciated workers cannot compete in a highly competitive world
951774 im not going to suffer through this like my parents
951775 the challenge is figuring out how all these things can be practical
951776 weve discussed the fact that bloggers by publishing their opinions and inviting readers to comment or contact them basically agree to open themselves to unsolicited information
951777 if you dont want to hear from us again we wont bother you again
951778 do we want to talk to people differently from how we did in the past
951779 things dont always turn out to be your fantasy thats why you need friendships that are real to get you through it all
951780 we have created this webstore for our group project in edge a course that explores how technology and globalization are transforming the business landscape opening markets redefining industries and erasing boundaries our projects specific goal is to connect readers with business related books that are recommended by industry experts one hundred percent of the proceeds from the sale of all books through our experts choice webstore will be donated to the kiva a charity that lets you lend to specific entrepreneurs in the developing world empowering them to lift themselves out of poverty scott white we went into this having no idea how many replies wed get but were happy with the quantity and quality of the responses we received
951781 we learn to write the way we learn to play a guitar any guitar teacher will tell you to practice every day
951782 some insurance companies make their clients have proper companies service the fire suppression system and provide a letter that states the system is functional and meets all codes prior to insuring them
951783 the reason clients can continue to trust our company for this type of work is because we participate in ongoing training all industries change and you have to keep up with the changes
951784 mybanktracker com realized that there was a need for an online banking services information destination that allowed users to comparative shop for a service that was best for them while leveraging the knowledge and experience of the millions of existing banking customers
951785 with the launch of my bank tracker were taking the personalization and social networking movement a step further by leveraging the power of the internet and of consumers to inform and educate in ways that were up until today lacking for traditional institutions such as banks
951786 we get to relieve consumers of their unwanted iphones and prevent hazardous waste from entering landfills by recycling rechargeable batteries
951787 they were ok but then this other car hit them
951788 there was a heavy deluge and that caused a significant amount of surface water
951789 i intend to build pride into a multi faceted manufacturer of defense and homeland security products that are needed by our united states government and its allies for our defense be it land sea or air
951790 i anticipate a significant and rapid turnaround in prides operations through organic growth and acquisition followed by a concomitant increase in shareholder value in short it is my objective for our investment in pride business development holdings to truly be defined by its name pride
951791 she was a fabulous artist she had a wonderful sense of color and design
951792 our revenue growth in the first six months of the year was driven by both our traditional products namely flour and our newer soybean products in fact with the strong growth of our soybean powder business we have recently decided to add soybean milk into our product line we believe that soybean milk can generate higher margins than the food business and creates a new avenue of growth for the company the production and sale of soybean milk will likely commence during the first quarter of 2009 we continue to explore ways to leverage our current strengths to uncover new opportunities for growth
951793 the second quarter of 2008 was our 15th consecutive quarter of year on year top line growth and our 7th consecutive profitable quarter considering the input cost increases that our industry has seen thus far this year we believe that our cost of goods sold has been kept at a reasonable level and we are committed to keeping our costs as low as possible to maintain stable margins although the bottom line was impacted by non cash items on our income statement we continue to grow and the health of our business remains intact demand for our high quality products is strong and we are well positioned for continued growth during the remainder of fiscal 2008
951794 we had very good signs which was the presidential election on 21 may and then the nomination of the prime minister
951795 and we said to ourselves we are going to make the baalbek festival so that everybody knows that lebanon is all right because once the festival of baalbek goes on this means we are in good shape
951796 we are facing financial competition from the gulf for the pop artists the pop artists are asking really terrible amounts of money but nobody could give them the setting that the baalbek festival provides
951797 the very least we can benefit from these festivals is to see the name of baalbek in the media
951798 for us baalbek is a symbol of culture of history the programme was not quite what we were expecting because we used to come here to see fairuz and the big celebrities
951799 but the festival is a symbol of life and that is why we are happy to be here now it gives us hope to deal with the problems in lebanon
951800 hey we know guys cant really fly and do all this stuff were just having fun with it
951801 u s presidential candidate barack obama talks about 16 months that we think would be the right timeframe for a withdrawal with the possibility of slight changes
951802 so far the americans have had trouble agreeing to a concrete timetable for withdrawal because they feel it would appear tantamount to an admission of defeat but that isnt the case at all if we come to an agreement it is not evidence of a defeat but of a victory of a severe blow we have inflicted on al qaida and the militias
951803 man f r ju sk mmas f r andra f r ldrar p s der
951804 theyre for defensive purposes were not going to attack anybody
951805 courage to change project a ptsd recovery program utilizing education and tat at fort benning georgia
951806 i have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from this community
951807 we are prepared to deal with any kind of security threat and we are confident we will have a safe and peaceful olympic games
951808 the new mobile site reflects the areas of redesign on the website
951809 as each section of the website gets a new look and feel it will be added to the mobile site as well
951810 the iocs priority is to ensure that as many people as possible get to experience the magic of the olympic games
951811 for the first time in olympic history we will have complete global online coverage the iocs channel will make fantastic olympic footage available where young generations of sports fans are already going for online entertainment
951812 the department for culture media and sport agreement that governs the help scheme urgently has to be reviewed
951813 the help scheme should not open the floodgates for marketing practices and advertising of additional products or services to older and disabled consumers which can leave them stressed and confused
951814 it is inappropriate for the scheme to select as standard such a confusing commercial deal when it is geared to encourage vulnerable customers to opt for a potentially confusing or costly installation
951815 the dshs must never act as a trojan horse for pay tv services to be promoted to vulnerable groups
951816 we have made sure that what people get for their 40 is clearly set out in the options pack as well as what is extra and what is taken away after two months and that they are under no obligation to subscribe
951817 we are concerned that the sky deal does not meet the usability requirements that had been agreed with government and that were applied rigorously to other products
951818 we understand that sky are being allowed to offset product energy inefficiencies by providing energy efficient light bulbs to customers this makes a mockery of the governments own policy on the energy efficiency of electronic devices
951819 we call on the government to stop and think again the whole aim of this programme is to ease the transition for vulnerable groups not to make it more complex or costly
951820 sky is committed to making the help scheme a success in the border region
951821 its a sluggish economy and its difficulties are felt all over
951822 that does suggest those folks are important for the spending outlook and the overall economic outlook
951823 consumer spending makes up 70 percent of gross domestic product and when one group accounts for a very substantial share of consumer spending they also account for a large share of the economic activity that creates jobs
951824 a lot of our clients stop by a deli on the way to the airport rather than have a catered meal on the plane
951825 were down to a total of two crews for three airplanes
951826 we face a very different environment for luxury indulgence in 2008 as compared to 2007
951827 a very difficult marketplace for luxury goods over the next five years
951828 people are examining do you keep the yacht do you go to the classic car auction do you take the private jet
951829 those sound like nice problems to have but at the same time they are issues
951830 the high end buyers out there are maybe more selective now but im willing to wait out the storm

951835 the first half of 2008 saw the most difficult financial markets for several decades marked by significant declines in profitability throughout much of our industry
951836 the continuing strength in the retail businesses in the developing markets
951837 we can take a helicopter up there to drop medicines and supplies but carrying out an operation is very difficult
951838 if there are any survivors up there they are pretty much on their own
951839 its very likely that these people are dead but small miracles happen all the time in the mountains
951840 it had to do with the very specific characteristics in the dna of the letters and what was in bruces labs
951841 i give them words that they have to look up in the dictionary integrity responsibility morals
951842 he stressed the fundamentals he puts a lot of time into it i cant even imagine how much time he puts into it
951843 my third season with him our team got off to a terrible 0 5 start the worst as start in something like 21 years
951844 he pounded that into us over and over and over perhaps too much
951845 but we began to win and we ended up winning 17 straight games after that which i think is somewhere in the record book
951846 the as are his life and he takes his job as coach very seriously
951847 it would have been nice to see him grow up
951848 he was very respectful i think he would have been someone very special
951849 just wanted to please john he always tried his hardest just so he wouldnt let john down john perry is one of those people who command respect rather than demand it
951850 this guy cares about baseball but beyond that he cares about children
951851 baseball is just the tool he uses to teach kids about life
951852 hes just a quiet guy hes so unassuming hes totally not in it for himself
951853 theres such value to what john does intrinsic value like the credit card commercial says its priceless
951854 obviously i am upset and worried for my familys safety in the future
951855 once we rebuild our house and move back in i dont know what more we can do
951856 i would like to see the citizens of santa cruz and our elected officials including the mayor step up and condemn this kind of violence
951857 if their father is willing to continue risking his livelihood in order to continue chopping up animals in a laboratory then his children are old enough to recognize the consequences
951858 this guy knows what he is doing he knows that every day that he goes into the laboratory and hurts animals that it is unreasonable not to expect consequences
951859 to put this on par with any of the human rights issues is an absolute insult to the integrity of the people who fought and went through the human rights movement
951860 this is what people do when they have an inability to articulate their point in any constructive way they resort to primal acts of violence any reasonable person would need a logic transplant to begin to understand this level of degraded thinking
951861 animal abusers everywhere beware we know where you live we know where you work we will never back down until you end your abuse
951862 the one thing we care about is when it is finished it looks good people from the whole world come up here to look at the hollywood sign
951863 it was a big disaster our view of it was the worst we looked right down at it
951864 that tree was stripped it was horrifying looked like a totem pole people thought we did it but we didnt
951865 because so many pilgrims were gathered at the shelter the way up and down was blocked
951866 when pilgrims started pushing down and the way was very crowded the stampede took place
951867 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
951868 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
951869 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it
951870 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
951871 in order to get beyond racism we must first take account of race
951872 john mccain has always been opposed to government mandated hiring quotas because he believes that regardless of race ethnicity or gender the law should be equally applied
951873 we will hit those points in a few years and that will help in many ways
951874 we just have to survive through this part of the cycle
951875 more delinquencies look like they are on the horizon because so few of them have reset
951876 some insurers can make a decision in the same day or right on the spot
951877 as health care moves into the digital age there are more and more companies holding vast amounts of patients health information
951878 most people dont even know these organizations exist unfortunately the federal health privacy rule does not cover many of them the lack of transparency with how all of this works is disturbing
951879 would be able to know that you have a very high near intractable cholesterol problem
951880 i had a patient on amitriptyline for migraines and they were denied life insurance because its also an antidepressant
951881 i had to explain it wasnt being used for depression
951882 i wrote an appeal letter and they still wouldnt give it to her
951883 weve got to stop these practices before the marketplace is fully developed and patients lose all control over their medical information
951884 a lot of insurance companies are starting to use this type of data
951885 they said all right prescription data is working lets go and look at other types of data too its because of the success of one that were going after others
951886 the message that it is okay to ignore the law
951887 but consumers will likely continue to have no real meaningful choices if they want insurance
951888 ooh this is a 60 minutes story in the making generally they wanted to make it a super secret database restricted to underwriting
951889 theres a huge case for it being opened up for all legitimate access
951890 whats even worse than the shift itself yes sometimes compromise is necessary is the ridiculous claim that it will bring gas prices down its never necessary to say something you know isnt true
951891 never offend people with style when you can offend them with substance
951892 i was asleep this morning and next thing i know i looked out the window and i see the swat team over in the ditch pointing the guns at the house
951893 weve made a verbal promise to the senior citizens that they will always have a place to hold their lunches
951894 the strength of a city is measured in its quality of living
951895 we try to get in guest speakers once a month to talk about senior citizen issues
951896 all we want is somewhere for the senior citizens to go monday through friday
951897 a lot of seniors donated their time to build this center
951898 every big town i know of has a community center
951899 its important for the elderly on low incomes to be able to buy a gift like spending a nickel to buy a coffee mug
951900 imidacloprid thats gaucho left a small residue in nectar and pollen but there was no evidence of a link with the drop in the bee population
951901 if we were to follow the teachings of miss carson
951902 we would return to the dark ages insects vermin and disease would once again inherit the earth
951903 mans attitude toward nature is today critically important simply because we now have acquired a fateful power to alter and destroy nature but man is part of nature and his war is inevitably a war against himself
951904 paradoxically as the clinical value of norvir was increasing dramatically its financial value to abbott was declining
951905 for one reason to get more revenue from the sale of norvir
951906 on behalf of his family and friends in galveston we are grateful for honoring dougs memory in such a wonderful way
951907 ghf is really pleased to see this type of interest in our employees and naming it for doug is a special incentive to recognize the role of volunteers in the mission of ghf
951908 the doug kanoy fund really sets a great model for others to follow
951909 we hope that other donors step forward to add support to the philanthropic vision of mr leopold and mr evans so that the fund will increase in years to come allowing for greater participation
951910 the environmental summit is a perfect way for us to get input and ideas from the community and elected officials
951911 by gathering ideas from the community we can continue to improve the services our dedicated staff members provide to the residents of galveston county
951912 community input will allow staff to meet goals that were established in a strategic health plan adopted in 2004
951913 the plan approved by the galveston county united board of health is designed to make measurable improvements in the health of galveston county
951914 the capacity of local communities to set their own autonomous goals to pilot their own strategies to develop the relationships they want is constrained and curbed by central governments nationally set targets challenges and protocols
951915 in 2002 the gap between the performance of free school meal pupils and non free school meal pupils in maths at key stage 2 was 10 percentage points its now 15 in science the gap was 16 points its now 20
951916 and in the last year for which we have figures nearly half of all pupils eligible for free school meals didnt get a single gcse at c grade or above 47 of fsm pupils thats 33 909 pupils without a single qualification at the basic level the government deems acceptable
951917 by contrast the number of free school meal pupils at the other end of the achievement spectrum the number getting 3 as at a level was just 176 thats fewer than 1 of those getting 3 as
951918 the sad truth is that if youre eligible for free school meals youre almost 200 times more likely to leave school without a single gcse pass above c than you are to get 3 as at a level
951919 michael gove really has to be careful not to denigrate the high quality of education in englands schools in order to make his arguments schools are tired of being described as failing by politicians who simply want to create clear water between themselves and other parties
951920 his proposals to increase choice and diversity and introduce a form of quasi voucher will undermine the social capital that he argues for and increase social segregation all the international evidence he refers to points to the damaging effect of choice and diversity on the efforts of countries to meet all childrens needs
951921 david cameron would do far better to focus on improving autonomy of decision making for teachers rather than boosting a market between parent and parent and school and school
951922 i was in contract talks before the euros but i stopped it because of the euros and we can sit down together one of these days again
951923 that is my intention always to commit to the club
951924 i love this club it is a great team and it is really nice to be in this team because everyone loves the game
951925 like me i love to play lots of combination football so i am in the right place but you never know unfortunately
951926 the eclipse had a convertible top was pretty much a two seater and got about 18 miles per gallon
951927 the prius is getting about 45 mpg and that allows us to go to dallas to visit relatives again affordably
951928 i have a beautiful cadillac sedan deville an 89 with 19 000 miles on it
951929 i chauffeured a friends niece to her prom in this white cadillac it cost me 44 11 just for gasoline

951940 the mind once stretched by a new idea never returns to its original dimensions
951941 its a film that is just rewriting the record books every day and redefining our notions of what a blockbuster can be
951942 the movie has grown in terms of its base audience from primarily what was conceived as a young male movie to a movie for everybody from 8 to 80
951943 theyre going to see it because of the reviews theyre going to see it because of the word of mouth theyre going just to see what its all about and they all like it
951944 it looked like we could do somewhere between 45 and 50 million but no one could have foreseen the juggernaut the dark knight has become
951945 the capacity of local communities to set their own autonomous goals to pilot their own strategies to develop the relationships they want is constrained and curbed by central governments nationally set targets challenges and protocols

951955 last night sunday everything came together and i am now moving to real madrid
951956 as everybody might know i have always wanted to move to spain because i have a strong bond with that country now im going to play for real madrid its a dream comes true
951957 looking back at the last couple of years im extremely happy that ive had the chance to experience playing for hsv no club and no set of fans will treat you with more hospitality than they do thanks very much for that sylvie and i will never forget you
951958 tomorrow afternoon tuesday i will be presented at real madrid this will be the start of a new chapter in my life i will do everything to help the team and the club to win trophies
951959 what joe has found are artifacts that link will eisner to the beginning of his career
951960 how about something solid like um brick batson yeah thatll work
951961 i think she probably went down head first and landed on her back
951962 i wasnt expecting anybody alive at the bottom of the shaft so i was shocked
951963 well die we fight and we die thats how it goes
951964 why do you think so many people even fellow democrat strategists are saying this was incredibly insulting and elitist
951965 well die we fight and we die thats how it goes
951966 why do you think so many people even fellow democrat strategists are saying this was incredibly insulting and elitist
951967 well die we fight and we die thats how it goes
951968 why do you think so many people even fellow democrat strategists are saying this was incredibly insulting and elitist
951969 you dont have to hate someone to mercilessly deride their every move
951970 you dont have to hate someone to mercilessly deride their every move
951971 i wanted a more experienced goalkeeper and rhys had the advantage of being here before
951972 i spoke to the millwall manager and goalkeeping coach and they high recommended him
951973 the transfer negotiations are still going on as far as i know
951974 i think so ive no reason to believe he wont andy johnson is a player with great quality wherever hes been hes done very very well hell give us balance up front that were looking for
951975 everything is important europe is important the premier league is important the fa cup and the carling cup so we will try to win every trophy and you never know
951976 we will try to win from the first game and then see the situation
951977 clearly we have confidence in ourselves and have the quality to try to win every game but you never know what can happen in any competition
951978 we started really well and finished really well last season
951979 if we can do the same this time then hopefully we will be better in the middle of the season
951980 but we will be working really hard to be as competitive as we can
951981 it was quickly rectified and there were no safety implications at any time she said
951982 we experience these sorts of delays right across our business
951983 the pre flight inspections are done as part of the safety systems within qantas and every other airline for that matter for this exact reason to find anything the crew or the engineers are not happy with a casa spokesman told aap
951984 there are so many potential problems that can be picked up before the aircraft is in the air it was a hydraulic leak a very routine event
951985 it shows that the safety system is working as it should in fact we should all be encouraged that the systems are working well
951986 on the top right of the speech bubble and they are gone
951987 i have seen god face to face and yet my life is delivered

951990 dit is een aanval in de rug als je met zoiets komt midden in de bouwvak heb je duidelijk de vooropgezette bedoeling de zaak te verzieken in een weekje tijd willen ze er een protocol doorheen stampen waar je normaal maanden voor uittrekt en dat in een periode dat niemand thuis is
951991 en dan is het niet kies als wij dat nieuws niet direct bekend zouden maken
951992 nee er is dan geen inspraak de beslissing de gevangenen te plaatsen is geen democratisch proces en de komst van de kliniek staat vast dat is definitief
951993 uitsluitingsmechanismen richting nieuwkomers gecre erd die tot uitval en vertrek leiden
951994 blauwe vrouwen hebben traditioneel minder kansen gehad dan hun mannelijke collegas blijkt uit onderzoek
951995 mannen die nu op een tweede plek zitten zien dat ze niet meer aan de beurt komen daar gaan intern de grappen ook over
951996 en dan hebben die grappen ook iets venijnigs met het risico van uitsluiting dat zijn mechanismen in iedere grote ambtelijke organisatie ik heb dat meegemaakt in amsterdam en dat speelt natuurlijk ook in de politieorganisatie
951997 i see it cousins arrival as a real positive for our playing group and our club to have someone of bens standard as a footballer to really set an example on the training track
951998 ben really wants to be a part of the playing group he wants to get back into the club environment and he really wants to be able to see where hes at from a football perspective
951999 the message we sent to the parents of our colts players and so forth is that well make the best informed decisions thats in he players best interests and clubs best interest
952000 we wanted to make sure its a positive experience and not something that is distracting
952001 theres no doubt about the way ben cousins prepares himself as a footballer
952002 you see the condition that hes in currently and hes certainly well and truly prepared himself
952003 has also led a one man crusade to keep the american people ignorant about what is at stake in the debate over off shore drilling

952008 its like the time i caught a 10 pound marlin but the line snapped i checked in my change saw a build get triggered shortly afterwards and i waited for the build to complete my change was there in the list of modifications but the qa team said that change wasnt in that build
952009 i just had to wait 10 minutes for the foolib project to build whats going on
952010 you know theres only one integration test server now so does the cruisecontrol build next time you go fishing with the cto you can tell him about the delays to the project and ask if we can spend some of next years budget on for another test server
952011 there are some days you could go into that gym and meet every major player operating in the costa region criminals from different gangs are all training together and discussing business while pumping iron
952012 following brain stem testing that was carried out earlier today ben mullany has now passed away
952013 all of a sudden i could hear my wife screaming her head off
952014 i thought there must be a snake or something i went to be confronted by this guy running round like lightning with a gun then it was horrific
952015 he made me lie down and made my wife tie me up with ribbon from the curtains this bloke was not on drugs he was quite calm and articulate he took my wife into the kitchen i could hear her saying not that not that at that point he had only touched her
952016 i then heard this enormous crack and my husband was sniffling and snorting
952017 with the husband concussed the robber made the wife go to the bed
952018 he raped me all the time i was concerned that my husband wouldnt see what was going on i was just saying to him stay down stay down the robber then finished what he was doing i didnt dare make eye contact
952019 the officers didnt treat her differently than anyone else they explained it was against the law and gave her a stern talking to
952020 kelly became really tearful and seemed incredibly embarrassed she was apologising over and over again
952021 she wasnt looking for any special treatment despite being famous and accepted the ticket in good grace
952022 as soon as she got teary she put on a massive pair of shades and quickly regained her composure it looked like shed been at a business meeting because she was wearing a smart black suit
952023 over the last few years there has been a boom in the number of market and social research firms in new zealand exacerbated by a number of australian and transnational firms who have outsourced operations to auckland in order to take advantage of the low minimum wage and deregulated work environment
952024 australian market research workers 3000 of whom are union members receive around twice the pay rates their fellow new zealand workers are paid
952025 the calling for change campaign seeks to take an industry wide approach to lift workers wages above poverty levels clean up conditions and build working peoples ability to organise to protect their interests at work
952026 this is the first time in new zealand that call centre workers have benefited from trans tasman solidarity and a campaign that seeks to unify all workers to gain industry standards on pay and conditions
952027 the willingness and ability of global companies to move operations across the world in a shameless search for the lowest wages will result in an endless race to the bottom unless checked by transnational worker organising and solidarity
952028 these global corporations while siphoning millions dollars of profit offshore undercut many smaller new zealand owned and operated companies that have better rates of pay and take an interest in the conditions of their workers
952029 i truly hope the decision to carry out this absurd crazy pathetic comic and useless retouching has been carried out without berlusconis knowledge
952030 yes that config file the config file on the hard disk that doesnt work anymore this post will outline how to manage your configuration for cruisecontrol without fear of losing it like many tools cruisecontrol becomes useless without configuration

952061 students are increasingly aware of the wider economic climate and this is filtering down into their decisions when they are choosing their university and also when deciding whether to take a part time job during term time
952062 students are discouraged from working during term time as terms are short eight weeks
952063 the holiday periods are therefore long giving many students the opportunity to take up paid work outside term time if a student is worrying about finances the university and colleges would prefer they came to talk about the wide range of financial support available
952064 as we compared his dicaprios photos with those of lenin the similarity was striking i should even say that leo could play the role of the revolutionary leader without make up

952089 in response to further press speculation the board of imperial confirms that it has received another approach in relation to a possible cash offer for the company

952101 the consequences of a possible military confrontation are so heavy that everyone is trying all other options to find a solution
952102 the iran u s crisis is spinning out of control tehran is willing to buy time in the coming four months to avoid a crisis
952103 he came here to convey the message of the french president
952104 it is absurd because at maximum he can convey this message that the threat of the west is serious which already is known to iran
952105 meltdown the inside story of the north korean nuclear crisis
952106 its interesting that the transcript remains classified but it appears that a north korean official used much more ambiguous language and also tabled an offer to negotiate which kelly rejected
952107 there are parallels and differences obviously with the way the intelligence became a source of controversy in iraq but unlike iraq the actual intelligence that the americans had in north korea in the spring and summer of 2002 was pretty solid
952108 but the combination of internal politics and media generalization created an impression that it was somewhat different from the reality
952109 they wanted to use this as a flaming red star cluster into the sky that the north koreans cheated abrogated the agreed framework we always told you this was a bad idea

952116 believed that the funds were in grave condition and at risk of collapse rather than disclosing the true state of the funds to investors and lenders thus allowing an orderly wind down

952119 there was no instance in my 20 year career where jimmy didnt always make himself available and happily
952120 if in the last few years he slowed down and wanted to play some golf who can begrudge him that he loved being in the game and to suggest otherwise is ridiculous the guy had bear stearns in his blood
952121 that was a period of not seeing the light at the end of the tunnel
952122 it was not knowing what to do its not being able to make a definitive decision one way or the other because i just couldnt tell you what was going to happen
952123 its just incredible to me that this could happen to the fifth largest securities firm in the united states
952124 the firm always had a good reputation ace greenberg was all about that he always said he would rather make 2 a day than risk losing more then this turkey
952125 chose not to do that and put all his eggs in one basket
952126 i didnt stop it i didnt rein in the leverage
952127 the thing i just would leave you with on jimmy is that from the outside ace had this reputation of being this lovable ceo and jimmy this tough guy its ironic when i see jimmy being billed that way because we all have such admiration for him although that opinion is not 100 uniform

952137 the first half of 2008 saw the most difficult financial markets for several decades marked by significant declines in profitability throughout much of our industry with consequent recapitalisation and restructuring
952138 the outlook for the near term remains highly challenging with significant uncertainty
952139 globally consumer confidence is declining and despite the short term success of the recent fiscal stimulus the us economy continues to be weak driven by continuing housing market difficulties
952140 the uk and other economies in europe which had enjoyed housing market booms have also weakened the decline in credit availability is accelerating this process

952258 about two months later i was signing autographs he said dead serious why would anyone want your autograph he said youre not any good youre just average

952273 im giving the maximum donation to obama then it might have been hypocritical this wasnt an announcement it was a reporter doing his job and kpd i think you are simply looking for an argument if you believe that article was in any way slanted towards either of the candidates

952289 um i guess i just wanted to know if there was anything more out there its like we spend all our lives being expected to believe in things we cant see and i just wanted to see one of them for once it doesnt have to be so big or so special or anything i cant expect to see truth or justice or the american dream or whatever just i want to see one time in my life that theres more to everything than like mcdonalds and womens studies

952388 un sistema como este con dos objetos muy masivos muy cercanos el uno del otro es precisamente el tipo de extremo laboratorio c smico necesario para poner a prueba la predicci n de einstein

952396 we will come out of the financial crisis but we still have to confront that problem of a changing balance between growth and inflation or what we like to call stagflation
952397 with corporate adjustments just beginning the euro area is at risk of significantly underperforming the u s and global economy for some quarters to come
952398 we expect the fed to stay on hold at 2 0 percent at the next four meetings
952399 as inflation eases and the economic recovery fails to materialize we expect the fed to make two quarter point cuts in the first half of 2009
952400 i would never turn round and say i was totally satisfied with our pre season but one thing i know now is we are ready for the league season and competitive football
952401 you can play lots of pre season games and still be scratching your head

952412 i think the accounting background will be very beneficial its a way of thinking that will be very useful something that i think our churches are lacking is good solid administrative skills so that we can more easily and effectively proclaim the word of god
952413 the prospect of going to prison is a daunting one but e ons proposed new coal fired power station poses such a threat to the climate that its something were willing to face
952414 we want to go to the camp to talk about how we find solutions to the climate crisis but the authorities have made us the subject of this ridiculous ban
952415 were being told we are not free to sit in a workshop and talk about global warming because of our involvement in a peaceful protest some months ago and several hundred miles away from kingsnorth
952416 were going to go to the climate camp even if it means jail because we dont believe its a crime to meet with others to try and find solutions to the gravest threat humanity has faced in recent times
952417 we took five young pros in at the beginning of the season sometimes you get surprised and one or two of them might be pushing for a starting place but its not quite worked out that way
952418 we might add another one or two depending on who becomes available and if thats the case then one or two might have to leave here to make room for players coming in
952419 they are good tests for us but thats why i picked the good sides because i want us to be a bit sharper there wont be a team in our league who are as good as maidstone or canvey island
952420 i cant fault the players work rate the desire is there but its just that bit of quality when we are on the ball people have got to start taking responsibility and have a bit more courage when they are in possession but thats what pre season is here for
952421 we have a bit of a crisis going on at the moment losing three goalkeepers to injury up until the injury to dan we had played well once lee went in goal things went astray i think he threw three of their goals in
952422 i had to look on the funny side jamie riley should be fit this week and as for josh and dan they should be fit in about a week
952423 therefore with heavy hearts but mindful of our responsibilities with regard to wrongful trading the board of wrapit plc set the insolvency wheels in motion
952424 hsbc now have it within their power to minimise the pain caused to 2 000 couples and probably 100 000 of their guests and ensure that no wrapit customer loses any money and as things stand they will not take it
952425 over the next fortnight the situation should become a lot clearer

952429 build confidence and trust among nations through collective maritime security efforts that focus on common threats and mutual interests
952430 housing prices have already fallen 15 percent and they need to fall 10 percent more this bill isnt going to change that equation
952431 this legislation will not perform miracles i want the american people to have realistic expectations about what were about to do
952432 but as others have said it is a step and an important step towards putting our nation on the road to economic recovery
952433 this is not the bill he would have drafted on his own but its time for action
952434 who have been caught between rising mortgage payments and falling home values and are in danger of losing their homes
952435 everything is so unstable and people are so panicky that i see a lot of this as an effort to calm people down
952436 the whole bill is an attempt to change the equilibrium
952437 clearly in areas where home prices have dropped its going to be utilized more
952438 it also depends on the borrowers unique financial circumstances why are they struggling did they lose their job if its a temporary hardship then youre not going to use this program at all if its something of greater significance then this may be the best option
952439 how effective can the fha refinancing program be in light of how slow and ineffective mortgage servicers have been so far
952440 theres a lot of vulnerability out there and we need to remain vigilant
952441 consumer spending was reported as slowing or sluggish in nearly all
952442 sales at most other types of stores especially discretionary or housing related items were typically characterized as weak or falling
952443 i would say in some sense that consumers are responding rationally
952444 sure theyve got these rebate checks thank you very much but im going to be very careful about when i spend and how and on what
952445 boston characterized sentiment in the sector as decidedly morose and industrial markets were especially weak
952446 office market conditions in the richmond district continued to weaken and were bleak in the washington dc area
952447 many districts reported on manufacturers plans to raise selling prices as a result of higher input prices with several commenting on fears of a corresponding decrease in customer demand and overall sales volume
952448 growth seems likely to slow in the second half of the year so it makes sense to wait and see how things are going before raising rates
952449 at the same time if those inflation numbers begin to get worse they recognize they may have to move sooner rather than later
952450 we cannot and will not allow a wage price spiral to develop
952451 if fed credibility looks a bit shaky with a weak dollar and high inflation expectations a one off rate hike could be a way to shore up your credentials
952452 over the course of the last couple of weeks the situation has gotten shakier on the growth front but we still think its a feasible option
952453 i think were too early in the process to know whether what the federal government is doing will be both necessary and sufficient to stem the crisis
952454 there is a lot of anxiety and it is being fueled by a lot of people for those of us who are longer term investors its been a challenging time
952455 there is a general expectation that were going to see more failures
952456 the big question is how many more and how many biggies will there be
952457 they did not resolve the problem they dealt with damage control
952458 we know the patient is not going to die but what is the eventual outcome is he going to loose a leg
952459 we have the power to respond if there are crises
952460 what we are looking for are rules that will make the crises less likely
952461 and i hope that early next year we will be able to complete it
952462 that will clearly take some time to consider and to get the legislation through
952463 i gather what youre saying is it is better in this very complex and very important set of issues that we do it right than that we do it very quickly
952464 were not saying take forever but we recognize the fact that the regulatory structure hasnt been changed in a long time and that its not going to be easy
952465 a major advantage of this structure is its timelessness and its flexibility
952466 because it is organized by regulatory objective it can more easily respond and adapt to the ever changing marketplace
952467 i would do it again i think it was necessary to protect the financial system i dont want to do it again
952468 a lot of issues that have long confronted low wage workers are now increasingly facing middle income workers
952469 i dont think we want to live in a country where people are working and doing what they are supposed to do but yet they cant get the basics
952470 unlike many well capitalized savings and loans and commercial banks fannie and freddie have chosen not to manage that risk by holding greater capital
952471 the availability of affordable mortgage financing is essential to turning the corner on the current housing correction
952472 we are at the early stages of what should be a promising path where the nascent u s covered bond market can grow and provide a new source of mortgage financing
952473 it remains to be seen whether the current restrictions and inherent execution costs on covered bonds will allow the vehicle to become a viable substitute for alternatives
952474 someday this capitalistic economy or what we used to call the capitalistic system needs to get back on track and that means failure
952475 i hope that we will look back on this announcement and say this was a very important moment in breaking the back of a lot of market fears
952476 but its way too early to say that and we must remain vigilant
952477 the federal government has done what it can to assure that fannie and freddie are too big to fail
952478 significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy lasting more than a few months
952479 if they raise interest rates that might slow economic growth which is already fragile and if they lower rates or hold constant theres a danger of inflation accelerating
952480 i happened to witness a bank run in midland texas one time
952481 ill never forget the guy standing in the bank lobby saying your deposits are good we got you insured you dont have to worry about it if you got less than 100 000 in the bank the problem was people didnt hear
952482 my hope is is that people take a deep breath and realize that their deposits are protected by our government
952483 we will come through this challenge stronger than ever before
952484 i think the system basically is sound i truly do
952485 and i understand theres a lot of nervousness but the economy is growing productivity is high trade is up people are working its not as good as wed like but to the extent that we find weakness well move
952486 one front right now is going better than the other and thats iraq where were succeeding and our troops are coming home based upon success
952487 afghanistan is a tough fight and its really important we succeed there as well as in iraq we do not want the enemy to have safe haven
952488 and if you do more things you set yourself up to have to choose among them and trade off what happens when concern for housing finance conflicts with the need to pursue price stability
952489 its reasonable to ask is it optimal to have the same organization perform both a financial stability function and a price stability function
952490 and if so how do you structure the organization so it can perform both
952491 the fed has several missions and monetary policy is the primary one
952492 but they also have a mission to stabilize the banking system and were in the process of expanding our view of what the banking system is
952493 but the economy is growing productivity is high trade is up people are working its not as good as wed like but to the extent that we find weakness well move
952494 i think the problem now is a general confidence crisis that is complicated by some global contagion thats now spreading
952495 need to act promptly and forcefully to break the psychology
952496 i think the treasury needs to be a bit more clear about what theyre planning to do to shore up fannie mae and freddie mac the details are still vague and there is no room for that now
952497 ongoing strains in financial markets declining house prices a softening labor market and rising prices of oil food and some other commodities
952498 the possibility of higher energy prices tighter credit conditions and a still deeper contraction in housing markets all represent significant downside risks to the outlook for growth
952499 at the same time upside risks to the inflation outlook have intensified lately as the rising prices of energy and some other commodities have led to a sharp pickup in inflation and some measures of inflation expectations have moved higher
952500 my own sense is that we are still trying to assess the effects of the first round
952501 it might be yet a bit more time before we fully understand the extent to which additional stimulus may or may not be needed
952502 seems likely to move temporarily higher in the near term

952525 congress may wish to consider whether new tools are needed for ensuring an orderly liquidation of a systemically important securities firm that is on the verge of bankruptcy together with a more formal process for deciding when to use those tools
952526 the feds decision to lend to investment firms although it was necessary to avoid serious financial disruptions could tend to make market discipline less effective in the future
952527 we have an established system for liquidating assets and its called bankruptcy
952528 as soon as you set up a special government system for dissolving one of these institutions youre signaling youre prepared to take them over and bail out the creditors
952529 to fulfill its responsibilities the fed would also need to have the ability to look at financial firms as a whole and the authority to set expectations and require corrective actions as warranted in cases in which firms actions have potential implications for financial stability
952530 im not sure if its realistic to expect it to be possible to eliminate financial instability
952531 im a little wary of being given a mandate for financial stability without some understanding of what in the world that means
952532 legislation may be needed to provide a more robust framework for the prudential supervision of investment banks and other large securities dealers
952533 it requires consultation between the sec and the fed in areas that the sec had thought previously were its exclusive business but the world has changed
952534 once you try to do a major overhaul you get into a lot of turf wars and you can get very bogged down
952535 this is working within the existing system which can be a more effective way to go
952536 information and analysis regarding the financial condition risk management systems internal controls and capital liquidity and funding resources
952537 this agreement will permit the expanded sharing of information on a confidential basis
952538 and help ensure that regulated entities receive a coherent message from uncle sam
952539 i have to do what i think is right for america but i want to add very quickly i understand the pain people are going through i understand the challenges
952540 i take stands on principle and i dont switch positions depending on what audience or what time it is in the electoral calendar
952541 for me to give up my advocacy of free trade would be a betrayal of trust i think the most precious commodity i have with the american people is that they trust me
952542 the presidents bring a wealth of knowledge acquired from their regional contacts
952543 thus in making policy we are able to view the economy not just from a washington perspective or a wall street perspective but also from a main street perspective
952544 we ought to wait and see what the bill looks like when we finish it to make a determination of whether its something good for the country or not
952545 there is nothing that is as important to this country as this bill is at this moment
952546 there is a strong bipartisan desire to complete this housing measure
952547 doesnt help the consumers and the people who are trying to stay in the homes
952548 we do think that there are some really good aspects of that senate bill
952549 and we have been working closely with them to try to change the bill in a way that we think it could be something that the president could sign
952550 there have been rumors of more write downs in financials oil is above 140 and so investors are selling before the end of the quarter
952551 i think the market doesnt like uncertainty and right now we have got a lot of uncertainty we have earnings coming up in july the continued high price of oil concerns about inflation stagflation and so there are still a lot of concerns and the market is pricing in those concerns
952552 it sure feels like a bear market and if you are in financials it is worse than that financials have just really been taken apart and it has been a difficult week for investors
952553 it is almost as if people have decided the second half of the year is not going to be better whereas before the light at the end of the tunnel was more visible people are concerned that it is going to take longer
952554 i have already paid for the flights and accommodation and i have managed to get a few tickets to a few events but obviously the tickets that i bought through this website are gone
952555 we are sending out requests today to outlets and shops to pull the games off their shelves and we will replace them with other games

952566 our nation has come to expect the federal reserve to step in to avert events that pose unacceptable systemic risk
952567 has neither the clear statutory authority nor the mandate to anticipate and deal with risks across our entire financial system
952568 we should quickly consider how to appropriately give the fed the authority to access necessary information from highly complex financial institutions and the responsibility to intervene in order to protect the system
952569 so they can carry out the role our nation has come to expect
952570 we must limit the perception that some institutions are either too big to fail or too interconnected to fail
952571 if we are to do that credibly we must address the reality that some are
952572 americans will rightly ask how high gas prices have to rise before the democratic controlled congress will do something about it
952573 president bush and john mccain are not serious about addressing gas prices
952574 if they were they would stop offering the same old ideas meant to pad the pockets of big oil and work with democrats to reduce our dependence on oil
952575 mccains capitulation to big oil could hurt him among independents and clinton supporters particularly in communities that depend on a clean ocean and beaches for their jobs and small businesses
952576 bushs announcement of support today makes it clearer that senator mccain is running for bushs third term
952577 when drivers are paying 4 for a gallon of gas and theres the perception that the economys going to hell in a handbasket voter attitudes regarding offshore drilling can change pretty quickly
952578 were saying that we feel a lot worse than we did at the depths of the last recession when we had had 2 or 3 million job losses that we feel worse than we did after 9 11
952579 at some level that just doesnt make a whole lot of sense
952580 things that you buy more frequently and that have large percentage increases will weigh more in peoples perception of inflation
952581 these partnerships will stimulate american jobs and contribute to our countrys economic growth
952582 signing these contracts is an example of the strong commercial bonds being forged between the united states and china
952583 these rising mortgage rates are going to push back any kind of housing recovery
952584 the federal reserve cant make corn grow and cant make somebody produce more oil when there isnt any
952585 will strongly resist an erosion of longer term inflation expectations
952586 im not saying the fed is going to raise rates because of this in june
952587 but it does put them a bit more on the defensive in terms of continuing to say that core inflation and inflations arent taking a turn for the worse
952588 under senator obamas plan americans of every background would see their taxes rise seniors parents small business owners
952589 ive said john mccain is running to serve out a third bush term but when it comes to taxes thats not being fair to george bush senator mccain wants to add 300 billion more in tax breaks and loopholes for big corporations and the wealthiest americans
952590 the substantive contrast between the candidates is deep and stark arguably sharper than between contenders in the last two presidential elections
952591 the mortgage crisis currently facing this nation was caused in part by misrepresentations and misunderstanding of the true value of mortgage securities
952592 by increasing the independence of the rating agencies ensuring they get adequate information to make their ratings and increasing industry wide transparency these reforms will address one of the central causes of that collapse
952593 we continue to operate in a volatile and uncertain environment
952594 since the crisis came about theyve made about 9 billion
952595 when you think about how much money others have lost during that same four quarters i think thats a pretty powerful statement
952596 i think this past four quarters demonstrates they are different
952597 goldmans not doing it so completely different from everybody else that theyre just going to be immune to all of these problems
952598 i think the severity of that is going to become evident over the next few years
952599 ive never said that financial speculation is behind all of the recent price increase here but even if its some of the reason its something society needs to look very hard at
952600 we could hire an extra 100 people and put them to work tomorrow given the inflow of trading volume
952601 we are doing the best we can in difficult circumstances this is something that we are obviously concerned with the potential for manipulation
952602 this is a reminder that working families continue to bear the brunt of the failed bush economic policies that john mccain wants to continue for another four years
952603 the wrong change for our country would be an economic agenda based upon the policies of the past that advocate higher taxes bigger government government run health care and greater isolationism to help families at this critical time we cannot afford to go backward as senator obama advocates
952604 theyre the worst in 22 years im told americans are hurting american families are hurting american homeowners are hurting this is a very very serious situation
952605 sadly it seems that is all president bush understood in the economy
952606 senator mccain is going to be faced with some difficult votes
952607 he has supported the bush economic policies and that will put him on the wrong side of some important economic issues in the coming weeks
952608 the federal government has never in history extended unemployment benefits with the unemployment rate this low
952609 its going to be the economy stupid all over again
952610 i think we have to do all of those things i think we have to search for ways to give short term relief i think we need to examine every option to try to help the american economy at this time both short term and long term
952611 for now at least we do not find any signs that they are discouraged enough to go back home
952612 construction paid me 32 an hour and with this i could pay my house bills and invest in my children

952618 will help alleviate some of the feds concerns over an uncertain inflation outlook
952619 to what extent and when the energy price onslaught embeds itself into core consumer prices is an open question
952620 bear stearns has forced an issue that we should have been thinking about anyway
952621 the issue isnt just that the fed did this thing in march its that the fed did what it did in march because investment banks posed risks to the overall financial system and the economy
952622 once the fed starts investigating and looking at the risks that theyre taking the market could back off and say well the feds in there so there cant be much risk
952623 we have to realize that this slowdown has generated a pronounced deceleration of consumer and business spending
952624 and i believe domestic spending is likely to stay sluggish that isnt such good news
952625 todays trade numbers show the strength of americas exporting companies in the world marketplace and highlight the critical role that exports play in helping the u s economy overcome challenges in other sectors
952626 the basic story that has brought oil from 20 to 130 dollars is that world demand is growing robustly when world supply is not
952627 as a result we need ever higher world oil prices to kill demand in the industrialized countries which is exactly whats happening
952628 the american taxpayers are paying for too many things that the iraqis ought to pay for out of their surplus
952629 they export 2 million barrels of oil a day that oil brings in about 120 a barrel it is unconscionable it is inexcusable it makes no common sense for a country that has that kind of wealth and that kind of surplus in our banks and their banks to be sending us the tab
952630 this is the first significant bipartisan change in our policy toward iraq
952631 pretty much out of the business of very large reconstruction projects in iraq
952632 theres no doubt that the high gas prices are motivating people to change their travel behavior
952633 thats a stunning thing and says to us that demand is there even if we raise fares
952634 we havent had this situation before where the ground is shifting underneath us fuel prices are at a totally different level than ever before and we are facing surging demand
952635 folks who are not regular transit riders to make that first step
952636 were engaged in a painful experiment in discovering how high the price has to go before it really really hurts before it hurts enough to slow demand globally
952637 represents an increase from 5 percent of household income to 8 percent
952638 there is clearly no shortage of oil in the market
952639 during a time of economic uncertainty the senate should recognize that the fed needs full leadership and we encourage them to swiftly confirm the pending nominees
952640 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
952641 the science team is trying to determine whether the water ice ever thaws enough to be available for biology and if carbon containing chemicals and other raw materials for life are present
952642 send this to smart women who need a laugh and to men you think can handle it

952657 one year on do you think the anti smacking bill has proved to be effective
952658 this is the voice of kiwi parents the opposition to the anti smacking law is just as strong as it was when it was first pushed by the prime minister and sue bradford
952659 and follows on from other polls which have recorded similar opposition
952660 the anti smacking lobby has tried to argue that nzers have changed their mind on the legislation and that the 390 000 nzers who signed the petition were either misled or have changed their mind these arguments have been found wanting and smack of desperation
952661 its time to tackle the real causes of child abuse violence and crime without criminalising the efforts of good parents raising productive and law abiding citizens of the future

952759 ill be dead when they finally figure it out theres no such thing as short term history so i am very confident in telling you that ill be long gone before somebody finally figures out the true merit and meaning of the bush administration
952760 seven years after attacks on america as the bush administration slips into history it is clear that what began on september 11 2001 as a battle for americas security became and continues to be a battle for the countrys soul
952761 the bush administration invoked the fear flowing from the attacks on september 11 to institute a policy of deliberate cruelty that would have been unthinkable on september 10
952762 the bush administrations descent into torture will be seen as akin to roosevelts internment of japanese americans during world war ii it happened in much the same way for many of the same reasons fear and anxiety were exploited by zealots and fools

952813 it is about showing that we are here that it is time that lesbian women who walk hand in hand in the street are not gawked at or spat on as happened to a friend of mine
952814 the parade serves a dual purpose to celebrate that we can be who we are and that we can do it in the open and to be visible building acceptance of homosexuality
952815 we are here for the party but also for the struggle
952816 the number of incidents of discrimination and of violence against gay people has increased in the past year

952827 i have wanted a child of my own for as long as i can remember
952828 so i thought i had better take the matter into my own hands if i were to ever have a precious wee one to cuddle and raise as my own

952832 i met gregory in a little fishing village in cornwall called weymouth weymouth is more of a working mans village or town actually not as upscale and touristy as bournemouth and southampton as a matter of fact weymouth was larger than a village had a shopping mall and all that not like our shopping malls but called that all the same it was a town actually villages only have a few shops and a grocer a pub and a post office so weymouth was a fishing town and gregory was a fisherman i used to walk along the quay and breathe in the marvelous sea air and watch the fishing boats unload their daily catches and would most times sit on the wall and have a crab sandwich one day gregory came out of the george inn across from where i was sitting carrying two beer steins filled to the brim and he asked me if he could join me said hed be honored if i would relieve him of one of the drinks he was carrying of course he wasnt really a two fisted drinker he had brought the drink to me purposefully hed been watching me every day that first week going to the george at lunch for a sandwich had become a habit
952833 i didnt want you to know because i didnt want him to know
952834 but it would have helped me to know who my father was
952835 hes your father we were in love didnt want to fall in love but i did
952836 desire to have my own child stronger than love maybe did the wrong thing dont think so
952837 i never contacted gregory after i returned from that wonderful summer on the south coast of england i had told him when we first met that i lived in new york and didnt tell him any different will you forgive me

952845 virtualization is already widely used but primarily for the first order benefit namely server consolidation
952846 the second order benefits of agility availability and manageability of the it stack are now becoming better understood
952847 and as a consequence virtualization has moved from a tactical tool for gaining immediate savings to become a key strategic theme for every it department

952858 people dont starve in this country its ok compared with other countries here you dont go hungry because you can just go and get money for free
952859 say 3 000 a month in their hands and theyre somewhere miles up north theyre not going to earn that sort of money so wheres the incentive for them to go out to work
952860 i work hard ive got two boys and i want to provide for them
952861 i really object because what it does is take the whole emphasis and focus away into something thats totally irrelevant and wont help a poor person at all

952864 groundhog day is coming lets put out a coupon for that the more shadow the higher the discount
952865 you never say never to someone new coming in but if we dont sign anyone if looks like people may be happy with what weve got
952866 ill keep looking but weve got less than seven days and a lot has to happen for that person to come in and do enough to play in the first game
952867 we did a lot of work on organisation and shape so that nicky could make the right runs we even had a practice match so he knew the players we have around him it proved a morning well spent
952868 naturally were all absolutely delighted that gareth will be staying at villa park and relieved to find a resolution and closure to the saga
952869 we had a very positive meeting on monday when it was agreed between gareth his agent mr randy lerner villa chairman and myself that a deadline should be communicated to finally resolve the situation
952870 liverpool were informed and that deadline came and passed now we can all look forward to the coming season with relief anticipation and ambition
952871 tremendous news about barry staying he looked a class act on saturday and thats with minimal preparation he will make a huge difference
952872 we thought that was it because we had a prior agreement with gareth and his agent
952873 its as clear as daylight that gareth will go we felt we had this agreement yet when that deadline passed it didnt seem to exist the chairman and myself are particularly disappointed as liverpool will get their wish and gareth will get his wish at some stage
952874 i could probably bring ole on for the last ten minutes even now and he wouldnt let us down
952875 it was a very emotional day for him and fully deserved
952876 i have had more than a year to get used to not playing but it doesnt get any easier and i knew this would be my last game at old trafford
952877 it has been a great day for me and my family though the 20 minutes that i played towards the end of the game are something i will never forget
952878 theo is ahead of what he was doing at this period last season and he is still 19 i hope theo will be a big part of the squad this season
952879 i have confidence in him of course but it is down to performances his first touch his much better and he moves the ball quicker his penetration and final ball is better there is goalscoring potential in him and i hope he gets it out of him
952880 we cannot put any limitation on his participation in the team the quality is there i dont look too much at his age just what he is doing on the pitch and at the moment the quality is good
952881 my priority is to get into the starting 11 for the first game against west brom and go from there
952882 i will just keep working hard in the pre season games and training
952883 i found it quite tough in the first week but now ive settled in a bit i want to get my full cap for wales ive always wanted to play for wales so its a massive target to get into the team for the qualifiers
952884 theyve been up against million pound players and crowds regularly of between 20 30 000 so this surpasses last year
952885 i have no problem investing further in blackpool football club
952886 this was always part of the long term plan we talked about when i first got involved with the club
952887 im enjoying the tv work and in discussing matches it is a big help that i played in every position on the field except keeper right at the top with united because i know closely the problems and needs of playing with so many different numbers on my back
952888 we have four competitions this season and i will try to win four competitions my players will do the same its very difficult but we have the players for this we have everything that chelsea have given to me and everything that i want
952889 i say to the players look you have confidence in yourselves and after this the rest is my problem the players have confidence they arrived last year in three finals thats very good for me i want to arrive in finals if we arrive in finals i am happy after this i know the way to win and the players know that too
952890 clearly we have confidence in ourselves and have the quality to try to win every game but you never know what can happen in any competition
952891 we started really well and finished really well last season
952892 if we can do the same this time then hopefully we will be better in the middle of the season but we will be working really hard to be as competitive as we can
952893 i think we can win everything we are very very close now that the champions league final has become an fa cup final the team who is very strong in england has a good chance to win the european cup the premier league title goes down to one game won or lost i believe overall quality going forward we were the best team in the league
952894 if success has gone to anyones head and they show signs they are ready to rest on their laurels they will soon be on their way soon i will look into the eyes of my players to make sure they have retained the hunger they need to succeed then we will look forward if i dont see the appetite and ambition then the bus moves on without anyone who has lost the spark

952901 debate on abortion is not a conscience pricking thing its a dead horse stop trying to beat it it took far too long to legalize it in the first place no need to try and send us back 30 years we as a society are trying to progress and it seems all religion has to offer is regression

952905 the nature of canada to this nations tolerance of individuals and ideas that reach to the nether regions of our traditional comfort zone
952906 this is a good thing this is why canada is much admired around the world
952907 what is wrong with informed and reasonable discourse on controversial issues
952908 are our universities into intellectual censorship or is debate on abortion a moral and conscience pricking thing and therefore deemed educationally incorrect
952909 i got a call from simon davey and that was that id been impressed by barnsleys performances in the fa cup last season and its clear the club has an ambition to get into the premier league
952910 there is nothing sweeter than promotion and ive managed to do it four times but there are probably 14 teams in this division with the same ambition and there is not a lot between the successful ones and the unsuccessful ones there is a very thin line and the key next season will be getting some momentum and doing it on a consistent basis
952911 you dont get to the semi finals of the fa cup without having the ability to beat decent teams and there is the nucleus of a very good side here all i have ever done as a player is give it 100 per cent and work my socks off
952912 it is excellent and i find it helps give me peace in the pressurised results based world of football it helps to keep my feet on the ground
952913 this is a big chance and i hope i can profit from this opportunity
952914 if you have a small restaurant then you try and make sure all the tables are busy at night before you move on to the next restaurant
952915 its not revolution its evolution i do think we need one or two areas strengthening we may be in a situation where we can bring one or two in that may change the picture
952916 theyre favourites to win the league this year but ive not had a bet on them anyway theyll probably win it now
952917 the feeling i get from the new owners i think they will be a top four side maybe not here but when they move on whoevers got the money are going to get the best sides obviously
952918 weve had fantastic demand for season tickets theres a huge feel good factor at qpr at the moment and were absolutely delighted with that i think were very conscious that people are starting to talk about a recession not everyone can afford a season ticket so we certainly want to have tickets available for those people that potentially cant afford a season ticket
952919 i think its the right thing to do were trying to grow the fan base and really grow the club from the really strong base that weve got
952920 we have almost 6 months until christmas why rush it

953029 we all know what simon jenkins means that chinas communist party leadership is winning the short term race to host the olympics on its own terms but it may face trouble running the marathon the longer term struggle i broadly agree with this analysis
953030 but when we use the word china to refer to the small group of party leaders who wield power then we play the communist partys game
953031 saying china when what we mean is actually the tiny group of men who run the country is a shorthand that weve all used myself included before you roll your eyes and accuse me of being picky i would argue that it is extremely important now in 2008 to make this distinction
953032 t his use of an all inclusive china is the most potent method of control that the leadership has over its own people to raise questions about one party rule indeed to raise questions about pretty much anything is to be anti china a dissident
953033 i have lived in china for about 15 years my sense as i spoke to people about the things that were happening was that there were far greater differences of opinion than at any time since the demonstrations and massacre of 1989
953034 we must distinguish china the nation from the communist party leadership which dictates policy

953129 black aids institute reported that if african americans with hiv aids were their own country they would make up more hiv aids cases than seven of the countries currently receiving emergency funding for aids think about that there are almost 600 000 african americans living with hiv and there are still 30 000 newly infected cases every year as things stand now aids remains the leading cause of death among african american women between the ages of 25 and 34 and the second leading cause of death among african american men between 35 and 44 years of age
953130 today 47 of the hiv cases in the united states are in african americans even though african americans make up only 13 of the population if you peer deeper into certain cities you find of all the hiv cases in washington dc 80 percent are among african americans in jackson mississippi 84
953131 the loss of set aside will undoubtedly have a negative impact on many of our farmland birds but we are particularly worried about corn buntings in fife and tayside
953132 in these areas corn bunting populations already depend largely on set aside as a low proportion of farmers take part in other agri environment schemes unless there is encouragement for farmers to manage a percentage of their land for environmental purposes it may be difficult for them to justify keeping some areas in more extensive management in the long run this is just not good habitat for corn buntings but benefits a range of other species
953133 its great that england has recognised that the loss of set aside will have catastrophic impacts for rural biodiversity and the scottish government needs to do something quickly if it believes in protecting our threatened rural wildlife it is a shame that we lost so much set aside this year fast action is needed if we are to implement measures in time for farmers to plan for 2009

953156 so now we must choose someone else to take judass place it must be someone greek aner meaning gender specifc man who has been with us all the time that we were with the lord jesus from the time he was baptized by john until the day he was taken from us into heaven whoever is chosen will join us as a witness of jesus resurrection
953157 therefore it is necessary that of the men aner who have accompanied us all the time that the lord jesus went in and out among us beginning with the baptism of john until the day that he was taken up from us one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection
953158 excessively faulting all jews for the suffering and execution of jesus
953159 history will record that the scholars and the president of the american bible society who published the first bible that contained no anti judaism in nearly 2 000 years were the first to record accurately the historical events of the first century
953160 are evangelicals who accept the bible as the inspired word of god
953161 this probably isnt the best idea as they might just do it
953162 an obvious recent change is in the area of gender inclusive language this creates problems for modern translators of the ancient biblical text which was originally written in a male oriented culture
953163 the translator must respect the nature of the ancient context while also accounting for the concerns of the modern audience
953164 no one who is asking us to look into this says we should ignore the scriptures
953165 the conscientious historian who is accustomed not to affirm anything except on the basis of careful and sustained research is surely obliged to question the naive assurance of those for whom everything is simple and clear at first glance
953166 were there deaconesses in the church of the first two centuries
953167 quo magis necessarium credidi ex duabus ancillis quae ministrae dicebantur quid esset veri et per tormenta quaerere
953168 we are permitted on the basis of the title given to these ministrae to associate them with the women who are themselves associated with deacons in 1timothy 3 11 but in so doing we must not lose sight of the fact that this association remains a very fragile and contingent one
953169 the disappearance of deaconesses and the memory of them that remained
953170 accompanying women wishing to speak to the bishop priest or deacon
953171 my goal was to present my understanding of bestiality and necrophilia to the class so that later on we can discuss how christians can do a better job of loving and understanding their beasty and necrophiliac friends family members and acquaintances i presented the bestial and necrophiliac orientation as both a fallen and yet unchosen condition a definition that stays true to both biblical teaching and peoples experiences it is in accord with augustines view of original sin that is further expounded upon in the westminster standards larger catechism to which our denomination the pca subscribes
953172 chemical baby killing what are you some sort of fanatic my parents used the pill back in the sixties are you saying they killed some of my brothers and sisters thats absurd why dont you go become a catholic you arent secretly going to mass are you matter of fact tell me your views on justification would you are you all imputation or are you sympathetic to infusion and speaking of imputation single or double dude no sneaking away and hiding behind a rock which is it en garde
953173 we may find ourselves with whole regions of the country where virtually every pharmacy follows these limiting discriminatory policies and women are unable to access legal physician prescribed medications
953174 were talking about creating a separate universe of pharmacies that puts women at a disadvantage
953175 these are uncharted waters since the issue of so called pro life pharmacies are so new
953176 contraception is essential for womens health a pharmacy like this is walling off an essential part of health care that could endanger womens health
953177 rape victims could end up in a pharmacy not understanding this pharmacy will not meet their needs
953178 weve seen an alarming development of pharmacists over the last several years refusing to fill prescriptions and sometimes even taking the prescription from the woman and refusing to give it back to her so she can fill it in another pharmacy
953179 if you are a health care professional you are bound by professional obligations
953180 in general i think product differentiation expressive of differing values is a very good thing for a free pluralistic society
953181 if we can have 20 different brands of toothpaste why not a few different conceptions of how pharmacies ought to operate
953182 contraception is essential for womens health a pharmacy like this is walling off an essential part of health care that could endanger womens health
953183 if you are a health care professional you are bound by professional obligations
953184 you cant say you wont do part of that profession
953185 their feet run to evil and they hasten to shed innocent blood
953186 could not be more wrong it does not cause abortions
953187 is that really a buck or is it a man im mistaking for a buck
953188 if you guys dont use birth control youll end up having twelve kids
953189 not really ever since you started crying whenever we talked about using the pill saying you never knew all those years that you were playing russian roulette with your babies my libidos been gone
953190 but sweetheart you know we can use a diaphragm or condom come on to bed sweetie and lets make love
953191 im tired honey cant we do it later this week
953192 but john this is the way youve been for months now ever since i asked you if we could use some other form of fruitless sex than the pill are you ever gonna wanna make love again or do i have to start taking the pill again so you think im pretty again
953193 oh no dear youre beautiful i promise you theres no one as beautiful as you its just im so tired anymore thats all
953194 so why did it all start when i said i wanted to stop using the fruitless sex method that works sometimes by killing my babies thats when you stopped wanting to make love
953195 alright yes whats the big deal talk about risk dont you realize each time we give our children a snickers bar its risky and they could die each time you put johny on a see saw or swing he could die every time you get him out of bed he could die whats the big deal life is dangerous get over it i dont want more kids my job isnt secure weve got 50 000 in credit card debt we havent even gotten our house equity up to the point where we can stop paying pmi and no im not going to run the risk of having more children by using a condom i dont like it and its only eighty or ninety percent effective and you yourself know how much we dislike the lack of spontaneity involved in using a diaphragm why cant you just chill out and think like a man everythings a risk so the pills a risk so what get a life honestly you women are wacko so you have a tiny chance of killing your baby so what theres risk everywhere everywhere and im telling you i dont want another baby not one more
953196 well yes they cause abortions but its so rare that you shouldnt worry about it
953197 naw were done no more kids i dont know if my wife agrees but were done lifes too wacko you know dude
953198 a risk is a risk and we take them every day
953199 well our friends who did in vitro but they made the clinic sign some sort of statement that the left over embryos would be adopted by a surrogate someday and not disgarded or experimented on
953200 but we all know that what ive written is the reality in a thousand homes and bedrooms for every one home or bedroom where theres a real risk to the mother thats so serious that everyone would approve of the couple making their lovemaking fruitless
953201 encourages bible believing christians to accept that the bible was the work of both humans and god
953202 holy men wrote as they were moved by the holy spirit
953203 graduate degrees from harvard he had tenure and he is
953204 repent repent repent i stand on the word of god repent
953205 when someone stands up and says homosexuality is an abomination does that make you want to get to know god
953206 i think god wants us to be bold i think god wants us to take risks i dont think god wants us to be afraid
953207 everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the lord and he delights in them
953208 this research once again dispels myths about 40 and 50 somethings
953209 the lack of brand loyalty coupled with their purchasing power makes the 40 59 audience an extremely desirable target that should not be overlooked
953210 job growth at the executive level is not moving in lockstep with the rest of the employment market
953211 thanks in part to an aging workforce and global economic growth the demand for executive talent continues to increase while the threat of a recession looms
953212 the closing of the salary gap based on gender is a welcome surprise
953213 studies have shown the gap closing over time but im thrilled to hear the playing field has leveled out
953214 we have seen job cuts increase in the majority of industries that we track
953215 uma grande perda para toda a r ssia estamos orgulhosos de que tenha sido nosso compatriota e contempor neo
953216 what are all these pr firms to do after years of doing things the same way everythings mixed up and whos there to explain this weird social media phenomenon
953217 there are things that will happen which i have no control over there are things that happen which are totally under my control
953218 what is the most important one thing i can get done now
953219 regardless of all of these work goals and any career paths that you might have in mind there is one goal that everyone should work on but yet few do your personal brand the concept might honestly sound funny to most people it is easy to confuse personal branding with attention seeking and a shot at stardom or at least your 15 minutes of fame but that is simply not it although many famous individuals do have strong personal branding you know you have attained strong personal branding when you are irreplaceable with someone else who has similar talents or job description and this is largely recognized in your community

953234 the pakistani commando division trained by the united states is an elite special operations force similar to the u s armys special forces or green berets
953235 the pakistan government wants to show that we want to bring terror in our region to an end and that we want to work with the united states for that purpose
953236 but we also believe that there is more that the united states can do as well and that we have asked it to do
953237 they have agreed to take certain measures but it would not be appropriate to make them public so that results could be achieved but we are discussing and have agreed to take certain actions to strengthen relations between the two countries and to fight the war against terrorism more successfully so our mutual objectives could be achieved
953238 of course the u s government should pay compensation its the u s militarys fault
953239 we feel detailed investigation should be done by the u s government itself
953240 the no gun ri incident became one of the milestones to take on this kind of incident in the future
953241 u s forces napalmed numerous small buildings and strafed children women and old people in the open area
953242 there were many similar incidents refugees gathered in certain places and there were air strikes
953243 everybody came out of their houses to see these low flying planes and everyone was hit
953244 the u s air force regarded all people in white as possible enemy
953245 civilians in villages cannot normally be identified as either north koreans south koreans or guerrillas
953246 i ran forward and all i could hear were people coughing and screaming and some were probably already dead
953247 how could they not tell the cows the pieces of furniture
953248 this is a matter of deep concern to the korean people
953249 the killings of korean civilians were extensive intentional and indiscriminate

953266 this car paid back its design and development costs many years ago allowing it to now be sold at a lower cost than a more recently developed car
953267 it usually takes a few years for revenue from sales to repay the development costs of a new car
953268 in developing markets the availability of ed cars is much lower creating the market opportunity for low cost new cars
953269 the u s has a ready supply of cheap cars but they are ed cars not small low powered and poorly equipped new cars
953270 the market five years ago was much smaller than it is today but there are still buyers with between us 5 000 and us 10 000 to spend on a car
953271 that demand is being met by new small cars with small engines and limited equipment becae there isnt an alternative
953272 a lot of the stuff i do is pretty basic
953273 its the type of stuff that a lot of people try to do but maybe its that im doing them all rather than just one or two
953274 i think one of the reasons i entered the contest was because it would be a great way to learn about what other people are doing and to raise awareness about being green
953275 its been a little bit overwhelming because its not like i do it for a certain purpose
953276 its just part of my life so its a little weird but its good as well because the more people that know about this stuff can do the same sort of thing and get involved in their communities
953277 i did it with totally no emotion whatsoever and i just about forgot the important thing so i said hang on ive got to do something else so then i went through all of them again forgiving them for what they did to my husband and then i broke all up and started crying from my very guts but i said it
953278 if we dont forgive then its like poison in our own systems were just like an emotional slave to the people who have hurt us
953279 there are so many so many women who have gone through what ive gone through there
953280 theyve had nobody to hold them theyve had nobody to tell their story to them and theyve had nobody to cry with
953281 i dont anticipate going back to kenya but uganda is waiting for us to come tanzania is waiting for us to come
953282 theres just so much work to do weve all heard about the bloodshed in rwanda in uganda in the days of idi amin just one nation after another that has had such bloodbaths
953283 we have a long road ahead of us in terms of going to all of the groups that have talked about having us come and share with them our vision as well as our experience with this incident and the state of the african child
953284 we have no idea how many months its going to take us to go over that road both in the united states and in canada there are unbelievably many opportunities open to us
953285 operatiunea de concentrare economica notificata a fost analizata prin prisma prevederilor legii concurentei si ale regulamentului privind autorizarea concentrarilor economice in urma analizei autoritatea de concurenta a constatat ca desi operatiunea notificata cade sub incidenta legii nu exista indoieli serioase privind compatibilitatea acesteia cu un mediu concurential normal pe pietele relevante identificate
953286 exista o corectie a pietei imobiliare n o vad in legatura cu decizia de dobanda a bnr nici cu normele de creditare corectia este legata de altceva piata imobiliara a fost emergenta disproportionata cu zone care ajungeau pana la 5000 de euro pe metrul patrat iar acum are loc o omogenizare
953287 nu avem inca statistici foarte corecte dar din ce am citit in presa inteleg ca au fost varfuri de neexplicat omogenizarea pietei imobiliare este benefica si ceea ce trebuie sa ne dea de gandit sunt tocmai acest fracturi in zonele limitrofe ale bucurestiului sunt zone cu 5000 euro metrul patrat iar la doi trei kilometri de 100 euro
953288 the us remains a difficult market with rising unemployment and falling house prices and we have recognised this with an impairment charge of 527m on the goodwill of our north american personal financial services business at group level
953289 hsbcs management insists that household can be salvaged by cuttting costs and downsizing the business we disagree
953290 todays results come as no surprise to us hsbc has a thriving and extremely valuable business in asia which is why its share price has performed as well as it has in 2008 relative to that of other banks
953291 we would point out however that the subprime and other credit related losses incurred by hsbc in north america since the beginning of 2006 now exceed 32bn that is to say more than all the profits earning in the emerging markets and hong kong over the same period
953292 on the positive side the rate of deterioration has definitely slowed but we have had two quarters of seasonally good factors with tax refund season at the beginning of the year and the fiscal stimulus package in the second quarter
953293 hsbc management suggest that the deleveraging of the financial system plays to their strengths the problems in the us were well flagged but many investors may focus on underlying group revenue up 2 suggesting that the strong growth in developing markets has not been strong enough to offset weakness elsewhere
953294 you can rest assured that there will be no failure in your plan
953295 though thisss is not something i approve i am in your debt
953296 tell me daniel is there ssssomething you want ssssomething that liesss heavily on your heart

953302 sssshould i kill the bird and cut off their contact completely
953303 you are not to lay a finger on that bird

953305 then ill retrieve legendary but you must do one thing for me
953306 ensure that you do not form a friendly bond with chrys
953307 im sure it will make esssscapee feel more sympathetic towards you plus make him look bad in her eyes
953308 i want you to form a quite clossse bond with essscapee not exactly on the verge of romance but enough to make chrysss feel upsssset
953309 now i must depart heed all i have said and you will be rewarded

953311 he has his duties to fulfill and you have yours as well you cant just follow him everywhere

953319 but dont go thinking thatll make me forget about chrys
953320 but that is your problem and i cannot help you with that
953321 can we go back to the lake please please please
953322 the theory is that if gas prices go up people walk or bike more or they take public transportation which requires walking to and from stops on either end
953323 also people eat out less when gas prices are high because they would have to drive to the restaurant and they have less disposable income
953324 i found that a permanent one dollar rise in gas prices is associated with a seven percent drop in overweight and a nine percent drop in obesity
953325 achieving just the minimum 35 miles per gallon fleet wide average by 2020 would cut oil use by 1 1 million barrels a day
953326 cutting the cost of gasoline at todays prices by more than a dollar per gallon
953327 further achieving a 35 mpg fleet wide average would create 149 000 new jobs nationwide in 2020
953328 ive started taking fewer trips out to see him but i stay for longer periods of time
953329 and when he comes here next month hell be here for 10 11 days

953332 we are working against the clock not just politically but out there in the real world because every year that passes we get more invasions and those invasions stay forever
953333 by the time the ship finally makes it into shore most of what you got rid of will have regrown
953334 you dont know what new or additional invasive species youll pick up
953335 there is no doubt that ballast water legislation that stems the tide of invasive species entering our waters from ships needs to be passed immediately
953336 disappointed that we have not yet been able to move this bill out of the senate

953351 least of all can one sympathise with teenage rebels without a cause who think it would be nice to be the next leader of the labour party they seem to understand nothing about the depth of crisis in which their party and government find themselves grow up or shut up is the best advice to them
953352 a year ago the conventional wisdom was yep there are problems out there but theres still significant value
953353 this morning we have deployed about 350 400 soldiers of the italian army at institutional sites and sensitive sites
953354 it is surely useful and people feel safer it is important that they dont exceed in their duties but i am sure that it will be so
953355 the forces deployed amount to 3 000 units from the army the navy the air force and carabinieri with military duties
953356 of these 2 000 are destined to the surveillance of sensitive sites and targets in particular 1 000 are destined to exterior surveillance of the immigration centres or cie centres for identification and expulsion formerly known as cpt centres for temporary stay
953357 we have fewer robberies in apartments in italy than the uk and we have fewer homicides than the rest of europe

953382 to be focused more on the priorities of the ministry than radio station management
953383 we are in a state of good relations with the clubs and im a little bit surprised that the clubs are taking such a strong stance not only against fifa but also against the players
953384 i think the players deserve a little bit of respect when they are asked by their national teams to play
953385 the accreditation process has already been completed and they cannot be replaced
953386 the three players are here they are training so please let them play
953387 the olympic games is something which enhances a players career former striker juergen klinsmann said that the best thing which ever happened to him in football was winning bronze at the 1988 olympics
953388 the olympic games started in 1896 and i think the olympic spirit should be maintained im sure they the clubs can afford to be without one player
953389 perhaps when they come back from the olympics they will be new players and a more valuable asset to their clubs
953390 last night everything came together and i am now moving to real madrid
953391 i have always wanted to move to spain because i have a strong bond with that country now im going to play for real madrid its a dream come true tomorrow afternoon i will be presented
953392 dogs were doing what animals usually do defecating and peeing
953393 there were lots of dogs and they have left lots of things behind and nobody even tried to collect them
953394 i have no idea how can i train in such conditions and who would clean the discus after every throw
953395 my dad made me realize what things are really worth
953396 just coming to america there are so many things it makes me really appreciate
953397 i used that to kind of motivate myself and see how hard people work and how proud people are to represent their country
953398 from that point on i was like man i want to go to the olympics
953399 the best thing that could happen for me is winning the gold for the united states
953400 being an american is not something im going to take lightly when i took that oath i meant every piece of it
953401 when i told them i was going to run they were actually kind of mad at me like what are you doing
953402 but when they noticed where this could take me they changed they became totally supportive
953403 this is very special running tonight now im part of the usa going to beijing im very excited
953404 yangs age is not an issue at all since the gymnastics team are already staying in the olympic village
953405 the aim has always been to start the race everyday i go out and plan to start the race
953406 im getting more and more confident because every day you run more on it and it gets stronger
953407 i feel good i feel happier even to be at this stage
953408 i know from the stuff that ive done that im in good enough shape to be on the start line
953409 i do hope that even if and when the ruling is against the players that the clubs would say ok we are now right and we were right to attack
953410 but let the players play this is what im asking
953411 im a little bit surprised the clubs are taking such a strong stance i would say not only against fifa but also against the players
953412 the players deserve also respect when they are asked by their national teams to play
953413 when cas is taking a decision we are bound by that decision
953414 im looking to do something different that the sport has never seen
953415 a couple of weeks ago it was all about usain and i was enjoying myself in the background
953416 i showed the world that asafa powell is still here
953417 i honestly think bolt can run 9 6 seconds asafa can run 9 6 and a healthy tyson can run 9 6
953418 four athletes ran faster than 9 90 seconds in 2004 but that might be like sixth place here

953499 doctors are duty bound if they see one of their colleagues doing something untoward to report it mr robertson said
953500 what has happened in this case is that over a two year period between 2004 and 2006 this individual has been allowed on occasion to operate without appropriate supervision mr robertson said
953501 that was a result of a breakdown of communication between the college of surgeons the medical board and indeed queensland health
953502 what this report suggests is that a critical lack of communication between industry and government agencies is putting patients lives at risk mr langbroek said in a statement
953503 the fact that a doctor with serious question marks over his head as to his clinical capability was allowed to operate without any supervision is beyond belief in this post patel era

953554 siempre tienes la presi n como delantero de que tienes que tirar a puerta y marcar goles y cuando no lo consigues empiezas a sentir una presi n extra y a plantearte qu pasa

953580 we tried to reach the parents the moment we discovered they were on the flight but the plane was already on the runway

953584 not only do i see the change but its like theyre moving the goalposts toward me and its an amazing thing
953585 we might see an ice free arctic ocean by the year 2030 within some of our lifetimes
953586 there are some scientists out there who think that even might be optimistic
953587 as near as we can tell looking at the historical record theres been ice in the arctic in the summer for at least 16 million years
953588 theres a group that makes a very strong case that in 2012 or 2013 well have an ice free summer arctic as soon as that its astounding whats happened
953589 as the ice recedes its opening up not only the arctic passage but all the resources in the arctic ocean
953590 we could think of the arctic as the refrigerator of the northern hemisphere climate system
953591 what were doing by getting rid of that sea ice is radically changing the nature of that refrigerator were making it much less efficient but everything is connected together so what happens up there eventually influences what happens in other parts of the globe
953592 the arctic really can feed back into the global climate system
953593 you know what happens when you get feedbacks you get surprises and we dont like surprises
953594 a race has developed between the waning sunlight and the weakened ice
953595 a combination of these two forces led to what we observe now and we should not ignore either forces
953596 there have been numerous models run that have looked at that and basically they cant reproduce the ice loss weve had with natural variability
953597 you have to add a carbon dioxide warming component to it
953598 we should care in the sense that what happens here is coming to us and sometimes you know a warning is a helpful thing to mobilise people
953599 then they said 2070 and then they said 2050 and then they said 2030
953600 not only do i see the change but its like theyre moving the goalposts toward me and its an amazing thing
953601 we might see an ice free arctic ocean by the year 2030 within some of our lifetimes
953602 there are some scientists out there who think that even might be optimistic
953603 as near as we can tell looking at the historical record theres been ice in the arctic in the summer for at least 16 million years
953604 theres a group that makes a very strong case that in 2012 or 2013 well have an ice free summer arctic as soon as that its astounding whats happened
953605 as the ice recedes its opening up not only the arctic passage but all the resources in the arctic ocean
953606 we could think of the arctic as the refrigerator of the northern hemisphere climate system
953607 what were doing by getting rid of that sea ice is radically changing the nature of that refrigerator were making it much less efficient but everything is connected together so what happens up there eventually influences what happens in other parts of the globe
953608 the arctic really can feed back into the global climate system
953609 you know what happens when you get feedbacks you get surprises and we dont like surprises
953610 a race has developed between the waning sunlight and the weakened ice
953611 a combination of these two forces led to what we observe now and we should not ignore either forces
953612 there have been numerous models run that have looked at that and basically they cant reproduce the ice loss weve had with natural variability
953613 you have to add a carbon dioxide warming component to it
953614 we should care in the sense that what happens here is coming to us and sometimes you know a warning is a helpful thing to mobilise people
953615 this increase reflected higher outlays of 27 1 million and 11 4 million on contributory and non contributory benefits respectively the increase in contributory benefits was essentially the result of an 18 8 million growth in pensions in respect of retirement which amounted to 154 6 million during the first six months of 2008 this increase was primarily underpinned by additional outlays amounting to 12 3 million on the two thirds pension in part reflecting a rise in the number of beneficiaries
953616 the board of imperial confirms that it has received another approach in relation to a possible cash offer for the company

953631 the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
953632 while we are naturally disappointed to see british airways suspend their services having had close dialogue with them throughout we understand the circumstances
953633 since british airways came on the route the market for air travel to and from london grew significantly increasing by 20 last year confirming our belief that there is scope for additional capacity on the newquay london route
953634 however it is a tough environment for all airlines in the current economic climate with oil prices at an all time high
953635 carriers around the world have been forced to cut capacity and routes and newquay is not immune from these global conditions but we know there is a strong sustainable market for air services to london we are confident that we will see services developing further as economic conditions improve

953726 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

953745 the us remains a difficult market with rising unemployment and falling house prices and we have recognised this with an impairment charge of 527m on the goodwill of our north american personal financial services business at group level

953747 todays results come as no surprise to us hsbc has a thriving and extremely valuable business in asia which is why its share price has performed as well as it has in 2008 relative to that of other banks
953748 we would point out however that the subprime and other credit related losses incurred by hsbc in north america since the beginning of 2006 now exceed 32bn that is to say more than all the profits earning in the emerging markets and hong kong over the same period
953749 on the positive side the rate of deterioration has definitely slowed but we have had two quarters of seasonally good factors with tax refund season at the beginning of the year and the fiscal stimulus package in the second quarter

953766 in our opinion the indicative proposal of a 4 40 a share is a low balled bid that significantly undervalues asciano

953769 doctors are duty bound if they see one of their colleagues doing something untoward to report it mr robertson said
953770 what has happened in this case is that over a two year period between 2004 and 2006 this individual has been allowed on occasion to operate without appropriate supervision mr robertson said
953771 that was a result of a breakdown of communication between the college of surgeons the medical board and indeed queensland health
953772 what this report suggests is that a critical lack of communication between industry and government agencies is putting patients lives at risk mr langbroek said in a statement
953773 the fact that a doctor with serious question marks over his head as to his clinical capability was allowed to operate without any supervision is beyond belief in this post patel era

953802 this is a very painful failure and a real setback for the global economy when we really needed some good news
953803 the breakdown of these talks is bad news for the worlds businesses workers farmers and most importantly the poor
953804 opening of markets removal of tariffs and withdrawal of state intervention in agriculture has turned developing countries from net food exporters to net food importers and burdened them with huge import bills
953805 this process which leaves the poor dependent on uncertain and volatile global markets for their food supply has wiped out millions of livelihoods and placed nearly half of humanity at the brink of hunger and starvation
953806 basically suggests that the poor countries should remain agricultural forever
953807 in order to receive the agricultural concession the developing countries basically have to abolish their industrial tariffs and other means to promote industrialization
953808 the tariff cuts demanded of developing countries would have caused massive job loss and countries would have lost the ability to protect farmers from dumping further impoverishing millions on the verge of survival

953934 in an urgent memo sent to gop members and staff saturday
953935 its not a request we make lightly but the american people are suffering
953936 the consequences of continued congressional inaction on gas prices are unacceptable weve called on the speaker to call congress back into an emergency session this month and schedule a vote on the american energy act we must continue to make a stand until the speaker complies
953937 ultimately unless you are prepared to buy the car without doing that theres really no benefit
953938 dont bother inventing you are only wasting resources human ingenuity will keep energy prices low and if it wont human ingeniuity will provide better insulation
953939 peak oil is not an economics concept it is an engineering concept as such it leaves out the role of prices and innovation why does anyone think it important
953940 were made wealthier when china and india produce valuable things that they trade us for oil
953941 we should achieve a certain goal through the political process
953942 we should work together to make the world a better place
953943 we should tax everyone in america a dollar and give it to me
953944 in order for china and india to have an effective demand for oil they have to give up something for it they are producing valuable things for this oil we are made wealthier as a consequence so our increased cost of acquiring oil is offset to some extent by the goods and services produced by these countries most of those gains though are captured by the oil producing nations
953945 im not so sure its a second order effect i took it to be an example of how oil is becoming more and more productive
953946 as an aside what about the fact that the rise in oil prices is also increasing the excise tax revenues that uncle sam is quartering away
953947 for oil price rise its increased value reflects its increased productivity
953948 in order for china and india to have an effective demand for oil they have to give up something for it
953949 were all made better off as a consequence of those exports

953954 theres all these people hiring cars at a cost of x why dont we offer a bus service at a price less than x

953958 s ignaling value of a university of california degree versus a cal state degree
953959 speculative manias gather speed because of an expansion of money and credit
953960 what it goes back to in a representative money regime or a fiat system like ours is the trust that our dollars can be redeemed for a dollar worth whatever that is of certain goods we want a stable store of value in a gold system gold can only represent a portion of all money obligations after all there is only about 4 trillion of gold in existence certainly not all money is going to be redeemed at once about half of the dollars in circulation are in foreign countries that means in a gold system gold probably would only represent the monetary base while the bank money would still be represented in interlocking balances backed by fractional reserves of gold at the fed or some other institution am i right about that
953961 no what is being argued for and the only thing that could tame the business cycle is 100 reserves yes gold is worth 4 trillion at current market prices but it would be worth a lot more in dollar and real terms if the dollar was backed 100 by it if a free market in money was instituted if all legal tender laws were repealed without the government backing up the dollar in some way the dollar would become worthless very quickly vis a vis competing commidity currencies

953976 ah so you must let youre dvds sit on the table for weeks
953977 in the short term price exclusively depends on the preferences of individuals and on the available stock there is no dependence on costs so there is no direct relationship between the price of a good and its marginal cost but finally even if we were to accept that prices have converged to marginal cost it must be noted that this cost is of no relevance to the decisions of the capitalist

953998 i swear to god i dont know what nothing is i know italy looks like a boot i learned that
953999 i know washington redskins linebacker london fletcher we did a football camp together so i know him
954000 thats the closest thing i know to london hes black so im sure hes not from london im sure thats a coincidental name
954001 hes already been recognized for his career fortunately hes come back to tack on more to that and he has a good team this year hes really one of the i wouldnt say the founders but a coach that took the one back offense and took it to a level far above what it was when he started there at washington
954002 what theyve done there under coach belichicks leadership is theyve acquired the right talent as everybody knows all the way across the board theyre very very solid you could look forever and i dont think youre going to find a weakness
954003 theyve done a great job of acquiring talent they do a great job of coaching it and i think to be able to put that together takes everybody working together so theyve done a marvelous job as far as im concerned in all the different aspects and thats hard to do i have a great appreciation for it its extremely hard and theyve just done a phenomenal job and at the current pace theyre probably going to set almost every football record you can imagine
954004 its just another way that we can utilize our personnel the best that we can use it
954005 were really rotating all three of them we start one over the other based on maybe different things during the week or what we want to start out in personnel wise or what theyre in personnel wise weve been playing some three safety defenses so really its not what james and rodney give us really all three of them are kind of in a rotation
954006 we just have to do a better job of tackling
954007 it wasnt any particular group it wasnt any particular individual it was kind of us in general we just have to keep our foot down keep going hard and not let up and i think at times we did that a little bit in the second half last week
954008 put on nancy grace any time at night and youll see people that have it worse
954009 we could be in iraq i try to find somehow to make myself feel better
954010 i mean it looked bad and felt bad it felt worse than it looked
954011 without a doubt i wouldve bet on it obviously we didnt and in the fashion that we did lose is really not acceptable to any of us
954012 you try to keep all of this out of your head but its so hard
954013 it seeps in after the first half its hard to go out there for the second half because 42 points wow i dont know how to explain it its hard to keep your juice your energy thats what makes it tough

954015 now an old man he teran can once again appreciate the colours of the sky and the forest to enjoy the smiles of his grandchildren and to watch football games
954016 but surely he will never be capable of seeing the difference between the ideas that drove him to murder a man in cold blood and the ideas of that very man
954017 no one will remember him tomorrow as it happened four decades ago when he hit the news i ask you not erase this name mario teran from your memory so no one will forget and all will judge
954018 remember this name mario teran a man trained to kill that sees again thanks to the doctors that followed the ideas of his victim
954019 now an old man he will be able to see the colors of the sky and the forest again enjoy t e smile of his grand children and watch soccer matches

954021 the customer management market sizing report 2007 2012 if its analysts do not understand that crm stands for relationship management not customer management
954022 looking back at the last economic downturn in the 2001 to 2003 time frame the customer management market suffered as projects were cut and vendors were acquired or went out of business
954023 however the effect on would be buyers was even more devastating as customer satisfaction ratings plummeted for years after the economy recovered

954088 i give apple two years before theyre turning out the lights on a very painful and expensive mistake
954089 people havent been willing to invest this much time and money or engineering in a store before
954090 its not important if the customer knows that they just feel it they feel somethings a little different
954091 our stores were conceived and built for this moment in time to roll out iphone
954092 it was like we have to do something or were going to be a victim of the plate tectonics
954093 we looked at it and said you know this is probably really hard and really easy for us to get our head handed to us so we did a few things no 1 i started asking who was the best retail executive at the time everybody said mickey drexler who was running the
954094 one of the best pieces of advice mickey ever gave us was to go rent a warehouse and build a prototype of a store and not you know just design it go build 20 of them then discover it didnt work
954095 and it cost us i dont know six nine months but it was the right decision by a million miles
954096 when we launched retail i got this group together people from a variety of walks of life
954097 as an icebreaker we said tell us about the best service experience youve ever had
954098 we said well how do we create a store that has the friendliness of a four seasons hotel
954099 lets put a bar in our stores but instead of dispensing alcohol we dispense advice
954100 were trying to get as fast as the dry cleaner
954101 weve gotten it down so theres only three materials were using glass stainless steel and wood
954102 we spent a year and a half perfecting that steel stainless steel can be cold if you dont get the finish right see the bounce see the blues up there
954103 were used to working on projects with very high standards
954104 how much better a mac is but windows users werent going to drive to a destination
954105 didnt have to gamble with 20 minutes of their time they only had to gamble with 20 footsteps of their time
954106 when we launched retail there was a real cult of the mac mentality
954107 but our goal was never to have a store for a cult it was to be a store for everyone so if you look around here
954108 apple has changed peoples expectations of what retail should be about
954109 after theyve seen apple how do they feel looking at a drugstore or the jeans section in a department store
954110 more contemporary more interactive look and feel like an apple store

954127 i plan on winning this fight and i will let the cosmic order take care of the rest
954128 within a very short period of time chessboxing has expanded the realms of the performing arts
954129 because you can train to become a good boxer but you need to know chess for a long time
954130 you really think i could have won in the boxing
954131 people are too focused on classifying sport in only one way life is much broader than that

954143 i will agree to lift these satellites into orbit if you agree to grow such and such more food and give it to hungry children
954144 i hope you dont have many sins left to be forgiven because if you let go of that youll only have sixty seconds to list them
954145 the only way were going to get action is if those who stand in the way of action come to be perceived as not just wrong but immoral
954146 were in shock theyre very responsible and organised top notch people apparently each one relied on the other and this is what happened
954147 it is usual that travellers in a rush forget their luggage but not a child this never happens
954148 i was sitting in the lecture where there were about 30 or 40 people but i saw some taking out their phones and taking pictures of me i decided it was getting too crowded so i went outside
954149 i went into the street and they started to follow me i saw them sending text messages and calling more people there were more and more crowds i was about to cross the street and a car mounted the pavement
954150 more cars came and people were following me shouting it was a riot
954151 the police car turned into the street and as soon as i saw the marked car i started shouting police help me help me the police asked what was going on and i said they were trying to kill me
954152 police saw a disturbance involving around 200 chasidic jews who appeared to be attacking somebody once he was removed the disorder ended

954154 these things are happening all the time but the rabbonim prefer to take a quiet road
954155 can someone please explain the warped rationale behind the attempt to lynch the man who is trying to bring child molesters to justice
954156 outside the chasidic community no one has heard of rabbi rosenberg but all the chasidic communities know of his work
954157 can someone please explain the warped rationale behind the attempt to lynch the man who is trying to bring child molesters to justice
954158 our industry right now is hungry for another round of innovation
954159 64 bit versions of windows will begin to find their way into high end gaming notebooks which increasingly are being used as high end notebook workstations as opposed to strictly gaming systems
954160 put more simply usage of 64 bit windows vista is growing much more rapidly than 32 bit
954161 based on current trends this growth will accelerate as the retail channel shifts to supplying a rapidly increasing assortment of 64 bit desktops and laptops
954162 he wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game

954164 new study shows 45 of search marketing campaigns are isolated from offline efforts
954165 if you think about how an operating system is loaded
954166 its loaded onto a hard disk physically located on that machine
954167 the operating system is tied very tightly to that hardware
954168 midori is one of many incubation projects underway at microsoft its simply a matter of being too early in the incubation to talk about it
954169 the real savings are around physical management of the devices and associated licensing
954170 within the microsoft environment we have struggled for years with applications that are written so poorly that they will not work with others
954171 virtualising this gives you a couple of new ways to tackle those traditional problems
954172 on the desktop we are seeing people place great value in being able to abstract the desktop from actual physical hardware
954173 people take their application the operating system they want to run it against package it up along with policy and security they want and use that as a virtual client
954174 the value of microsoft windows of what that product is today will diminish as more applications move to the web and microsoft needs to edge out in front of that
954175 i would be surprised if there was definitive evidence that nothing like this was not kicking around
954176 eighty percent of windows sales are made when a new pc is sold
954177 thats a huge amount of money for them that they do not have to go out and get
954178 this sting operation proves that there are gaps in the system and that scam artists can exploit and are exploiting those gaps
954179 if real fraudsters had been in charge of the fictitious companies they would have been clear to bill medicare from the virginia office for potentially millions of dollars worth of nonexistent supplies

954181 obviously spore comes from a very strong pedigree and the title itself looks dynamic
954182 certainly the expectations are very high sales of several million units but i wouldnt put it in the realm of
954183 i think they dont need to appeal to anybody outside the hardcore wright and sims fans
954184 needs to sell in the millions and last a few years to pay back the investment but you know we were probably going to spend the money on something it might as well be on spore
954185 we dont provide financial breakouts for individual titles or any formulas we use in determining financial performance
954186 that said i can tell you that no one at ea is measuring spore with the yardstick created by the sims theyre two totally different animals spore is a game that has a lot to offer players long after they make the original purchase a much different business model than traditional video games
954187 while its important to have an actual game within the game
954188 i think gamers are so fascinated already with the creature creator and the ability to make buildings and spaceships that their expectations are going to be a lot lower than what ea would need in another game
954189 i think part of it will result from word of mouth and viral marketing
954190 is it something that people want to talk to their friends about friends and family taking notice and saying gee i want to do that as well its a little bit premature to say definitively whether spore will do that or not

954198 researchers have concluded that any two people on average are distanced by just 6 6 degrees of separation meaning that they could be linked by a string of seven or fewer acquaintances
954199 msn messenger users are not a random group of people their use of the redmond companys instant messaging tool is already a selection which raises chances they can connect to each other in fewer hops furthermore instant messaging itself is not a measure of real life connections also somebody can have many contacts in their instant messenger client without actually knowing them microsoft researchers considered acquaintances people who sent each other at least one message but with the mass messages going around thats hardly an accurate way of determining connections between people

954257 the biggest response is that they havent found a practice accepting new patients its nice that i can just tell people that they are welcome to come back to us

954271 they have known about these sites for months and months and did nothing
954272 they have dashed the hopes and dreams of thousands of people who have been planning for years to go the games and have already paid thousands of dollars for airfare and what they thought were legitimate tickets
954273 i was sure wed have no problem placing our three new crossbred pups with a family but again i was wrong it seemed no one wanted a crossbred puppy
954274 frustrated and annoyed with the problem of placing the pups i decided to stop mentioning the word crossbreed and introduced the term labradoodle
954275 it worked during the weeks that followed our switchboard was inundated with calls from people who wanted to know more about this wonder dog
954276 the joy of the hybrid is that there is always a little variety in doods and it allows people to choose just the right dog for them
954277 i began to worry too about backyard breeders producing supposedly allergy free dogs for profit
954278 were breeders bothering to check their sires and bitches for heredity faults or were they simply caught up in delivering to hungry customers the next status symbol
954279 i asked a lot of questions and found a breeder who was very understanding and answered all of my concerns and they always keep in touch with me
954280 i think that everyone should carefully consider bringing home a pup of any breed a new dog will impact the family and the home for up to fifteen years
954281 truly truly i say to you unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of god
954282 he was brain dead or something something was wrong with him right there hes probably one of our more intelligent players and like i said hes brain something got crossed up there and he decided to take off but hes a better player than that and he knows thats not a good situation to run in
954283 yeah i mean you know in a ball park such as this we definitely had some opportunities and we really didnt take advantage of them i feel very confident though that were gonna be able to turn this around and start swinging the bats like were capable of
954284 im hoping its a bump in the road not a hill you know if its a bump we should be okay you know some of the guys i dont want to say are pressing but in those situations where we need to get that hit its just not coming right now we just gotta do better we need to get back home get out early do some work and get our stuff together
954285 it was just poor execution the entire game you know we made some mental mistakes we couldnt get anything done with runners in scoring position and we didnt make the pitches when we needed to make the pitches so just a poor day of execution all around

954319 i dont think ive seen you here before first time
954320 i was told this was the sort of place a man like me could finally relax
954321 ive even employed some from time to time and a few of my regulars are mutants
954322 i try and supply an atmosphere where anyone can come and take a load off
954323 youve employed some then on stage they incorporate any special talents into their act
954324 well i think thats how it should be i dont think its very fair to look down your nose at someone just because theyre different its all genetics anyway
954325 i believe the law states that powers are not to be used in public
954326 you dont have any powers of your own do you
954327 so whos a mutant here youre protecting them arent you its sweet really
954328 how do i know you speak the truth you could also be a cop
954329 youre french right whats something you can only get in france that you desperately wish you could get here
954330 will it be open one way to find out paris is what 3000 miles or so
954331 mm i can tell although most women dont like quick finishers
954332 youre not telling me and i just got you this lovely present
954333 now im going to get the information im looking for if you think youre protecting them you are mistaken youre doing them a grave disservice by not introducing them to the world of opportunity that we can provide
954334 one more time who are the mutants working for you
954335 im not telling you thats their right to privacy and i was warned about you that someone might come
954336 youre right you are absolutely right they should come of their own free will im only here to spread the message of brotherhood to
954337 brothers and sisters magneto has sent me here to reach out to you in these difficult times he wishes to extend an invitation to all those who feel they must hide your proprietor has chosen to deny you this important opportunity
954338 but no more must you be a slave to the humans to their rules their fears their definitions no more will you be an object of their hate and their lust magneto holds greatness in store for us all
954339 this cash cow could be in for a period of decline
954340 this is not the old crying wolf kind of stuff
954341 theres been about a 20 percent decrease in sales at lunch people are doing away with larger lunches the 40 to 50 steaks theyre going down to lighter burgers
954342 the damage on wall street is affecting all of our communities
954343 and the effects on our new york state financing are devastating
954344 it was a decision i made on my experience and the information given to me
954345 right now the district is not going to do any further projects with these two entities unless theres a clear demonstration that the quality of their work and services has significantly improved
954346 the district wants to work with organizations that are professional and have the capacity to deliver the district wants no role with mediocre organizations
954347 i suggested to stark that he meet with fox i said in this current political climate it would be good for the avengers to have the presidents blessing to operate freely
954348 to sweeten the deal for fox of course the avengers services would be at his disposal
954349 we never really needed stark conspirators dont let anything slip to outsiders all we really needed was somebody to make the man nervous
954350 that he doesnt want anybody close to him is pretty tellin anyway
954351 we just want him to flinch widow everybody does when they know somebodys watchin em
954352 stark may have done that difficult to say i wasnt there and i heard it from stark so what
954353 stark cant be controlled by the government not yet anyways fox knows that he knows how powerful stark is how much he needs his support his money his weapons
954354 theres a pretty secretary been on the cover of magazines lately pretty secretaries always know somethin dont worry about the failures romanova shit happens just make sure it cant be traced back to us
954355 i can assume a new identity but thats high up they can find me out and if they did find me out that will put my position with the avengers in jeopardy
954356 i can research and find out what personality type shed respond best to
954357 do it i may not use an operative for this but id like to have the option
954358 you got it boss im going to get some alone time with the captain soon as i can see where he really stands on all this ill relay that back to you soon as i get it anything else you need
954359 i have more news that will undoubtedly make you happy
954360 strange has lessened my powers he means to control me by use of two witches
954361 so you what have a mystical chastity belt on or something
954362 something like that and yes a coven your cousin will be in it
954363 but heres the curious thing strange was terribly upset that i brought you back hence the coven and when i first went to him for help after feeling dreadful about sending you off in the first place he wasnt very much help at all why do you suppose that is
954364 couldnt tell you satana maybe he doesnt like zarathos i dont know
954365 id be a bit concerned that the sorcerer supreme didnt mind you were gone did nothing to bring your soul back and was only pissed about the whole thing when you did in fact return to the earthly realm but thats just me enjoy your candy bar
954366 he didnt care that the world was absent a spirit of vengeance
954367 probably he is the guardian between realms isnt he was he glad i sent you back to where your soul belonged did it restore some sort of order did he not send me home so that i would do it myself keeping his hands clean of it hard to say hes a difficult man to figure out where his alliances lie
954368 no hell is miserable i wanted to get out i even tried a few times
954369 he should have known that he knows then the barriers between this world and the next are breeched why did he not aid you it should have been simple for him should it not
954370 me neither but he has me under his thumb as well now
954371 hey laura you trying to escape the suffocation of homework too
954372 you skipped class huh i would have but im like two years behind so im stuck with the kids god its embarassing
954373 what oh just the usual horribleness i hate school to be honest i was never any good at it and no matter what kind of grades i got my dad was never happy so i gave up but they wont let me give up here they practically had mr summers walk my ass to class
954374 no not today i have before but i promised dr mccoy id apply myself this year
954375 dr mccoys pretty cool you will have no problems youd mind works like a steel trap when you get focused on something whenever weve sparred your eyes have never looked anything less than ready for combat i imagine you get the same way with a book in your hands
954376 consider yourself lucky that you never had to go to school but still got an education you more than anyone here can probably catch up in no time
954377 heck i might even have to ask you to let me copy your homework eventually
954378 everyone here wants to help everyone else youll do well
954379 with school and fighting you cant compare yourself to anyone else thats what they tell me
954380 everyone tells me that too they always tell you that it doesnt work in the real world i watch enough television to know that if someones better than you they can beat you and they can kill you
954381 was it logan you two seem kind of close so it sounds like something he might confide im not saying hes a bad person
954382 this guy magneto hes going to start a war and were going to be right in the middle of it if we get attacked it doesnt matter what kind of grades you have they wont go nice on you because youre good at math i keep feeling like im the only one who sees that
954383 no it wasnt logan it was a man named victor creed
954384 this guy must be bad news then he doesnt come around here does he well doesnt matter right
954385 how many skips do you think you can get with a stone
954386 he is and no he doesnt i thought he might look for me be angry and want to find me but no he doesnt come here the professor is too powerful
954387 its comforting to pretend everything is going to be okay and normal its easy to fall for the delusion even for me
954388 i guess i just dont know what that means ive never been able to pretend everything will be alright maybe it makes me odd but someone has to be cautious i suppose
954389 come on give it a try i bet you can get at least six
954390 honestly i think hes a lunatic but hes also got a point mutants get treated like second class citizens like were a bunch of maniacs wholl slaughter innocent people at the drop of a hat normal humans have been murdering eachother for centuries yet act like mutants are somehow worse
954391 i dont believe mutants should rule humans i do think we can all co exist peacefully but there will be a war there is always a war for change to happen on such a scale there will not be peace and quiet it will be a loud painful thing and magneto wont back down
954392 ive been told so many things that are wrong and conflicting
954393 laura i know youre worried about what this could mean for you you told me you were made to be a weapon and i know thats not who you truly are if there is a war theyll ask you to bring out that part of you that you dont like
954394 believe me i understand what it feels like not completely i could never claim that but i do have some idea what it could mean people will die innocent and soldier alike but so many others will live because of those who choose to fight to protect them some mutants would slaughter every human they could but they wont get that chance
954395 war is violent it is destructive and it is chaotic this place wont be safe no where will truly be safe but you cant live in fear of it i wont i would rather die fighting than hiding if i have to kill to protect myself and others i will do it not because i want to but because i will have been left with no other choice
954396 i know youre worried we all are you among all of us would have the best chance of fighting this war and surviving you cant be afraid of that
954397 you can save dozens of lives by taking one if you ever have to do that it will be for a noble reason my dad before he went sour believed so much in the law that he almost died in the line of duty for it not everyone can make that committment but someone has to
954398 this school is something to rally behind if theres a war they will come here for us and to destroy the school its a symbol and weve got to protect it i used to think xavier was a coward for sitting on his hands until i saw magneto theres got to be a balance and the young people of today will be the ones who have to fight to keep it
954399 no its nothing to rally behind not as it is they want us to hide to pretend its foolish
954400 hes making an army you said it magneto doesnt care about calculus he isnt teaching his army art theory hes training them for battle
954401 can we only get behind xaviers ideology because its nice
954402 ive given it a lot of thought lately laura xavier doesnt have the solution but what he does have is hope those kids back there those too young to fight need that hope you cant move into the future if youre too busy fighting to stop and look around xavier gathered us here to protect us from those people who wouldnt understand he isnt forcing us to be nice little pacifists every mutant who learns to properly control their powers is a mutant who can defend themselves
954403 you were trained in your powers from the moment you were born you were conditioned to become what they wanted but youve proven that a person can change can take what theyve learned and apply it in another way of their own choice every mutant here has that choice and theyll have to make one
954404 if a war comes the school will be split some will go and fight others will stay and hope it blows over i will be going to fight because i believe this war is inevitable but how it ends is not thats why i like this school now because it has brought together an army of intelligent young mutants who are smart enough to know what will happen if they sit on their hands while magneto wages war if push comes to shove the school will shove back im sure of it
954405 i havent changed im delusional im pretending the truth isnt there
954406 i know what i am i can pretend to like clothes and boys and tv but i dont i sit in class and i think about how i would kill everyone in the room if i needed to every time i enter a room i calculate all the different ways i could get out again who i would need to take out and how im not anything other than what i am theres no use in pretending like there is no use in pretending everything is going to be okay
954407 laura you may have thought of all that and you may even be thinking it now but you havent acted on it if you were a machine youd do as you were told and none of us would be alive right now but you chose not to that makes all the difference in the world
954408 free will and the ability to decide for ourselves is what makes us human you were trained to be a weapon and the trigger wasnt in your hands but now it is only you can control your actions now
954409 i dont know you as well as others but i know that youre not a killer you dont want to be what you were made to be you dont have to fight if you dont want to and you shouldnt feel like you have to just because you can it all comes down to choice
954410 if it comes to protecting the people here i will feel like i have to because i can
954411 last time i went swimming in the lake on a whim doug had me put on a big t shirt
954412 the bikini jubilee gave me covers about as much as my underclothes though
954413 its been baking outside how can this water be so cold
954414 doug dont think ive met him but he sounds like a good guy most guys would be trying to get you to skinny dip with them if they could
954415 errr i guess it does but youll catch your death of cold well maybe not you
954416 that healing ability of yours is useful mine works slower but it helps keep the more common colds away
954417 yeah the uh the healing works great you uh certainly heal nicely
954418 a girlfriend well once kind of when i was in 8th grade it was only for a couple months and mostly it was me copying her homework and uh hanging out together
954419 i know about it we got sex education when i was in middle school and where i lived before xaviers i had full cable so i got a good idea
954420 like any kid ive done stuff but the big one well i want to wait its the way i was raised and i like having that to look forward to but knowing me itll just happen and ill never think about the vow again
954421 sex is kind of a primal thing its very instinctual and people attach a value to it that having sex somehow makes you cool or more mature i blame the media really but people make their own choices
954422 boys like it more than girls i was talking about it with jubilee only shes never had it either but its probably better when its with someone you like or love i dont know i did it all out of order
954423 well dr mccoy strikes me as the kind of guy whod read stories with strong romance themes in them i heard hes read like every book in xaviers library
954424 sex is a dominance thing for guys like a sign of power most guys brag about it because they think it makes them cool and other idiots cheer them on me i dont think it matters one way or the other
954425 you may not be a virgin any more laura and you may have had sex but it was just a physical act when you are with someone who you genuinely care about youll know and youll feel it past the physical aspects you have the benefit of knowing its not that important so you arent so focused on it like some folks
954426 youre very matter of fact about things i like that
954427 i have to meet this doug guy you seem quite taken by him he sounds like a bookworm too i never figured that was your type
954428 what me lifes too short to beat around the bush im direct because it makes more sense to me people who wait and wait may miss what theyve been dreaming of because the hesitate not me baby carpe diem
954429 im direct too i dont know how to be subtle
954430 then i definitely have to meet this guy and treat him to a drink or something sounds like you made a good find laura
954431 subtley is best saved for sarcasm and comedians you and me were fighters were direct people theres no subtle way to punch someone so subtley holds less importance to us
954432 your type honestly i would have considered logan your type if i hadnt found out hes like your dad you strike me as the kind of girl who wants to be a good girl but you cannot help but be attracted to bad boys i dont know really i just dont see you settling down in a quiet house raising a bunch of kids
954433 you have to point him out to me sometime id like to meet this guy see where he stands maybe hes more than just a bookworm the guy could be a surly brooding anti hero or something
954434 but i wont tell him a thing just check him out cant have you hurting the poor guy if he does something stupid
954435 hes just a bookworm and i wouldnt hurt him he wouldnt stand a chance i protect him
954436 dont tell him that youll damage his pride guys like to think they protect the women they care for its all about ego with us guys
954437 ill find him chat him up see what kind of guy he is who knows he might be cool to hang out with
954438 he knows i already told him id be his body guard
954439 been teaching him how to protect himself too in case im not around and hes pretty cool hes smart
954440 sparring with him huh i can vouch for your skill at training i think ive gotten a lot better from having to keep myself alive and unbeaten when sparring with you
954441 no not sparring not really more of talking to him he doesnt want to fight not really he just wants to be able to hold his own if someone else wants to fight with him his power is understanding languages so
954442 did you say you think id like bad boys because you consider yourself one
954443 just start calling doug al and see how long it takes for him to explain it its nothing bad just a little joke promise
954444 you should have him read some japanese books on martial arts or chinese i read some of sun tzu this week he discusses war in depth if the guy doesnt want to fight then he can learn to avoid fights through a defensive martial and strategy
954445 im not a bad boy laura im just honest and a bit of a jerk at times i think youd like bad boys because you have a wild side to you one that has nothing to do with your upbringing youve got the whole instinctive predator vibe to you
954446 he has hes read just about everything i think hes even read it in chinese
954447 youre tough you like to fight you lived on the streets
954448 damn maybe i should be cheating off him he do tutoring
954449 my mutation is designed for combat i come from a violent home which i got kicked out of if that makes me a bad boy then oh well doesnt mean i think you and i should be going out or anything you still have to find the person you connect with
954450 ive seen logan enough and heard enough about him to see the same in you you have the same cautious almost cocky approach to life you have confidence beyond the average person and the way you move is graceful and instinctive showing how deeply tapped into your instincts you are
954451 im sure hed help you out if you asked i can ask him if you like
954452 why not why arent you or doug the person i connect with
954453 confidence might come from the fact that we cant get killed
954454 ill ask him i mean i should be man enough to approach him and ask ill just tell him you mentioned he was a genius massage his ego a little and hell help if you asked hed do it just to do you a favor and its better not to owe people favors
954455 you decide who you connect with all i am saying is that you can never tell im not a perfect judge of character maybe the bookworm type is just what you need and want its up to you to decide for yourself
954456 you can get killed everybody can die laura but you and logan seem to have a never say die take no prison approach to life i can see it in your eyes
954457 you seem to be a pretty spot on j judge of character if you can see so much in my eyes
954458 you and me have sparred twice and both times ive gotten good looks at you the you behind the talk and smile
954459 like i said thats just me im not a telepath or anything but ive been around a tough crowd and they all had the same habit of showing their true selves in their eyes just the way it is
954460 youre a wonderful woman laura youve very kind and though you wont admit it innocent in a way thats why im glad to be your friend
954461 besides youve beaten my head in twice and havent gloated about it once in front of anyone if nothing else that makes you tops in my book
954462 were going there and i dont even want you to get your socks wet
954463 continue to ask stupid questions please you learn faster that way
954464 have you ever danced taken any sort of dancing lesson
954465 no everything i know is self taught ive lived in an alley all my life
954466 your feet need to be light you need to be able to barely touch the ground you should be a millimeter from flight
954467 it helps to be able to see where youre going
954468 too much of a man for ballet and rescue huh
954469 not as fast as me no but faster than you thought you were
954470 i lied to everyone she didnt die during childbirth she died when i was a kid and i wasnt fast enough to save her
954471 you will be fast enough for the next person who needs you
954472 im not the one you need to worry about disappointing
954473 my mother died in childbirth never had a proper mother or father before finding magneto i dont even know what its like to have one consider yourself lucky for the short time you had with yours
954474 do you think you can make it without the motivation you had before
954475 you wont have the ice to dance over this time
954476 light feet light feet barely touch the water let it rise up to help you dont fight back against it good

954526 i dont think obama was lying in 2005 ive always thought that he didnt expect his campaign to take off the way it did i think he figured hed run a good attention getting primary campaign drop out after south carolina and set himself up for the future i think that the coalescence of the anti hillary democrats around his campaign surprised him as much as it did hillary and that hes been running a brilliant piece of improvisation ever since
954527 maybe its just that we have learned nothing can compare to the perfect moment of the unexpected hookup wet lips on the beach lying in the sand and so we aim to accumulate as many as possible or maybe were simply too immature to commit that has been the rap against guys forever but now women think the same way with the world and the world of sex at our fingertips its difficult to choose to settle to compromise but i do occasionally wonder if we cant get past ourselves and learn to sacrifice to be with another then what is in store a generation of selfish go getters fueled by nothing more than our own egos forever seeking that rare dose of self esteem an era of loneliness filled with commercial wants and mate selection based on the shallowest of criteria

954530 jullie moeten je k van tevoren ori nteren wil je niet voor vervelende verrassingen komen te staan
954531 en er is daarvoor geen betere plek denkbaar dan een restaurant als de soep te zout is of het vlees aangebrand dan krijg je dat onmiddellijk
954532 te horen en zul je er ook onmiddellijk op moeten inspelen
954533 maar dat woord is een containerbegrip je kunt service pas cht leren van de gastvrijheidssector van de horeca dus bedrijven gaan van service naar beleving dat is de trend en daar spelen wij als engel amp colfield op in
954534 de back office is de keuken en die is open
954535 dan train je maar n spiergroep bij pilates ben je met diverse spiergroepen tegelijk bezig wat veel functioneler is in het dagelijks leven je wordt van pilates dus niet zozeer sterker maar je krijgt een goeie lichaamshouding
954536 mensen met kantoorbanen zitten vaak de hele dag verkeerd achter hun computer en dat geldt k voor degenen die regelmatig in de sportschool te vinden zijn met andere woorden ook mensen met flinke spierbundels kunnen nek en hoofdpijn krijgen vanwege een verkeerde houding op het werk en om dat tegen te gaan zijn er pilates oefeningen daarom geef ik corporate lessen op de werkvloer waarbij ik werknemers leer hoe ze langer goed kunnen zitten belangrijk want zo kan het bedrijfsleven miljoenen aan ziektekosten besparen
954537 ik denk functioneel ga dus niet naar een bedrijf toe met de gedachte wat voor leuke oefeningen zal ik vandaag nou eens gaan doen ik wil dat mensen zich na een sessie tien centimeter langer voelen d n hebben ze het goed gedaan ik beul niemand af propageer geen spierpijn
954538 je moet zaaien op goede grond pas d n kun je oogsten
954539 ik wil niet voor een ander de kluitjes uit het riet halen
954540 wie zich vergeet voor te bereiden bereidt zich voor om vergeten te worden
954541 zorg voor een houding van g ven want je h bt ook iets te bieden namelijk een luisterend oor
954542 maar doe dat nooit met een smoes zeg niet ik moet even naar het toilet want je zult zien als je terugkomt staat degene van wie je af wilde keurig op je te wachten om het gesprek voort te zetten pijnlijk
954543 het bouwen onderhouden en optimaal benutten van persoonlijke relaties met als uitgangspunt de ander tot zegen te zijn zodat de resultaten die men nastreeft vrij baan krijgen om zich optimaal te manifesteren
954544 ik voel nog steeds een vlam in mn reet als ik op het podium sta
954545 how fucking dutch is that en ik mijn elfjarige zoon maar uitleggen hoe belangrijk het is dat ik nu tegenover jou zit michael terwijl ik hem had beloofd dat we op vakantie zouden gaan naar hawaii
954546 hij heeft zijn opinie wel op een bepaalde manier verwoord ja maar ik heb hem uitgelegd door interviews te geven kan papa al die fucking spelcomputers voor je kopen jongen ik heb onlangs gelezen dat de elfjarigen van nu de zestienjarigen van vroeger zijn hormonaal gesproken nou die van mij is daar het levende bewijs van en zijn vriendinnetjes ook want er zijn er bij die doet alsof hij een mud aardappelen tegen zijn borst drukt m b my goodness gracious
954547 nat rlijk is het een nederlandse naam want mijn beste vriend is nederlander adrian vandenberg spreek je m weleens
954548 bravo ik zal m gelijk een e mail sturen om m te feliciteren fabulous musician lovely guy
954549 nee w l herinner ik me een monsters of rock festival in arnhem utrecht m b steve vai zat toen ook in de band maar omdat we in holland waren mocht adrian van hem lle solos spelen how generous adrian zag trouwens pas op het podium dat ik een klomp op zn wah wah pedaal had geplakt we hebben ook nog champagne gedronken uit een klomp herinner ik me nu ja klompen en tulpen waren wel de running gags in mijn conversaties met my dear dutchman mister vandenberg
954550 nog slechts zeer sporadisch michael de jaren gaan tellen geen interesse meer in all night parties
954551 dat was in 1973 in clearwell castle toen glenn hughes en ik als nieuwe leden van deep purple aan de pers werden voorgesteld mijn eerste interview was met een japans meisje dat eindigde met de woorden i wish you good ruck with youl lock and loll dat vond ik toch z schattig hahaha de rest van de heren journalisten dacht alleen maar who the fuck is that guy want ik was natuurlijk een totaal onbekende kledingverkoper uit noord engeland working class nota bene dat besefte ik tijdens mijn eerste trip met deep purple naar parijs gingen we exclusief uit eten in het peperdure restaurant george v lagen er ineens twaalf tot veertien stuks bestek naast mn bord ik had thuis niet eens een mes en een vork in dezelfde kleur haha nou ja goed opgelet wat de anderen deden en dat precies zo nagedaan vergelijk het met synchroonzwemmen haha tja das nu op de kop af vijfendertig jaar geleden
954552 nee nee nee nee nee onzin ik ken de geruchten en denk ook te weten waar die vandaan komen jon lord zal wel een keer met een slok op iets tegen een journalist hebben gezegd en met internet gaat zon gerucht tegenwoordig de hele wereld over en krijg je het als waarheid in je gezicht gesmeten er heeft eens iemand op het web gezet dat ik de nieuwe zanger van van halen zou worden volslagen nonsens maar als die sneeuwbal eenmaal aan het rollen is hou je m niet meer tegen
954553 geen enkele interesse ik ben blij dat ik david coverdale van whitesnake ben hoewel ik dol ben op queen toevallig sprak ik paul laatst nog hij is heel enthousiast over die nieuwe plaat die ze hebben gemaakt maar nogmaals niets voor mij als zanger van whitesnake kon en kan ik al mijn muzikale wensen vervullen
954554 dat is niet aan mij maar aan jou om te beslissen michael ik schrijf die songs voor jullie voor het publiek maar persoonlijk ben ik erg tevreden over here i go again daar zit alles in wat whitesnake tot whitesnake maakt stemtechnisch gaat het van bijna fluisteren naar krijsen de melodie blijft in je hoofd zitten en de tekst is goudeerlijk over mijn gevoelens ten tijde van mijn eerste scheiding its a perfect little song and i like it
954555 haha das een goeie maar nee wat anderen doen is nooit voor mij een stimulans geweest om het k te doen bijna elke avond voor ik het podium op stap draai ik my generation van the who w nzinnig vind ik dat nummer lets spend the night together van de stones onge venaard die originele versies zijn zo verschrikkelijk goed waarom zou k die nummers dan in vredesnaam nog op de plaat moeten zetten wat voegt dat toe verbeteren kun je de originelen toch niet en aan mn live set hoef ik ze ook niet toe te voegen want ik heb inmiddels z n enorme catalogus aan eigen songs dat ik daar bijna onuitputtelijk uit kan graaien
954556 how fucking old do you want them i doe burn
954557 het meeste materiaal voor dat album heb ik geschreven toen ik nog in deep purple zat voor de plaat die de opvolger zou worden van come taste the band nou ja zo ver is het uiteindelijk nooit gekomen omdat de hele zooi in elkaar donderde maar whitesnake was dus van origine een song voor op een nieuw deep purple album
954558 pfff het was het beste wat ik op dat moment kon doen ik probeerde maar wat een beetje boogie rock in whitesnake een beetje funk in goldies place je had blindman wat een indicatie was van waar ik met de band whitesnake naartoe zou gaan
954559 waarin ik mijn liefde voor percussie tot uitdrukking bracht inderdaad een ratjetoe aan stijlen dus interessant dat wel maar bepaald geen meesterwerk slecht geproduceerd ook het lijkt wel een demo ach ja ik was hartstikke nerveus toen ik die plaat maakte en niemand wilde er een cent in steken we hadden amper tijd om de nummers in te studeren dus gezien de omstandigheden hebben we er best iets aardigs van gemaakt denk ik maar meer ook niet ik had eenvoudigweg nog niet de technische bagage om ook daadwerkelijk te maken wat ik in mn hoofd had zitten heel anders dan nu dertig jaar later ik bedoel mijn nieuwe plaat good to be bad blaast je omver
954560 ik kwam toen net uit het coverdale page project en vond het prima om weer onder de vlag van whitesnake cds te maken z groot is mijn ego nou ook weer niet maar mijn management zei me misschien is het goed om nu eens iets onder je eigen naam uit te brengen geen slecht idee want dat zou me de mogelijkheid geven om ook buiten het whitesnake idioom te opereren zonder daarbij trouwe fans voor het hoofd te stoten hoewel we natuurlijk ook als band veel verschillende stijlen hanteerden ik heb weleens gezegd dat ik whitesnake zie als een creatieve paraplu waaronder hardrock rhythm and blues en soul samenkomen heel anders dan deep purple met zn vastomlijnde patronen daar moest alles wat we maakten toch eigenlijk van die pompende highway star achtige hardrock zijn dynamisch beslist maar wel belemmerend bij het schrijven van songs toen ritchie en ik voor de verandering eens iets totaal anders componeerden de bijna middeleeuws klinkende ballad soldier of fortune moesten we er een demo van maken om de anderen ervan te overtuigen dat we het op de plaat moesten zetten het album stormbringer uit 1975 m b en toen pas vonden ze het cool ik weet nog dat ritchie tegen me zei dit is de allerlaatste keer dat ik dit heb gedaan hij was volkomen pissed off dat de anderen hem niet op zijn woord hadden geloofd dat het een fantastische song was een paar maanden later was ie uit de band en begon hij rainbow
954561 is die er dan nee ik ben meer ge nteresseerd in mijn eigen biografie mocht die er ooit komen een titel heb ik al how white was my snake
954562 pardon ik meen me te herinneren dat ze m j van h m hebben moeten sleuren hij viel me van achteren aan en dat was een grote fout van hem maar laat ik hier niet verder op ingaan ben veel te blij dat we juist weer een beetje goed contact met elkaar hebben stom toevallig zitten we nu bij dezelfde platenmaatschappij en ik moet zeggen we zenden zo af en toe rather nice messages naar elkaar
954563 ik hou daar ook van kan ik je zeggen eigenlijk is soldier of fortune een voorbode geweest van wat ritchie nu doet maar terugkomend op restless heart dat begon dus inderdaad als een solo album echter toen we halverwege waren wilde mijn toenmalige platenmaatschappij emi toch dat ik m als whitesnake plaat zou uitbrengen daar hadden ze het recht toe want ik stond er onder contract als david coverdale known as the artist whitesnake dus toen heb ik adrian er maar wat steviger gitaarsolos aan laten toevoegen en heb ik de drums wat luider gemaakt maar om je de waarheid te zeggen het werd er niet beter op
954564 h ik ben bijna 57 als ik een nieuwe plaat uitbreng wil ik die graag op een fatsoenlijke manier promoten met een grote wereldtoer maar ik vrees dat ik dat fysiek niet veel langer aankan nu voel ik nog een vlam in mn reet als ik op het podium sta maar hoe zal dat over een paar jaar zijn het mag geen zielige vertoning worden nee wat ik nog w l graag zou willen doen zijn intieme akoestische shows gewoon in een kleine club liedjes zingen en verhaaltjes vertellen dat werk en gewoon communiceren met het publiek vragen beantwoorden en zo ik denk dat mijn materiaal zich daar prima voor leent bijna al mijn bombastische songs zijn gecomponeerd op een akoestische gitaar dus ze zullen best overeind blijven in een unplugged versie sterker de meeste songs van good to be bad heb ik op een speelgoedinstrument van mijn zoon gecomponeerd zon schaalmodel met nylon snaren
954565 oh god ja dat is lang geleden je had ooit van die zogeheten pop shields die er bij woorden als but en put voor zorgden dat je niet in de microfoon spoog nou ja ik haalde op een gegeven moment het nylon eruit en spande er dan een damesslipje omheen was ook ter inspiratie kon ik beter kreunen tijdens de ballads
954566 och van degene met wie ik die dag was ik was een stoute jongen but sometimes its good to be bad michael

954597 our supporters can accuse us of many things but were certainly not boring
954598 youd rather lose a game by trying to play exciting expansive stuff rather than have everyone falling asleep at the stoop
954599 weve changed how we play its a lot more expansive and we use the ball a lot more the by product of that is you make errors and you let the opposition back in and end up on a rollercoaster ride sometimes
954600 weve done this a few times when weve looked very good and played some really attractive stuff but ended up being pipped at the post
954601 you make a great a very great mistake if you think that psychology being the science of the minds laws is something from which you can deduce definite programmes and schemes and methods of instruction for immediate school room use

954617 in somalia back in 1993 climate change according to 11 three and four star generals resulted in a drought which led to famine
954618 one of the worst disasters in history made me want to do something in 100 years new orleans could just be another atlantis
954619 cutting carbon emissions is mainly in your hands since you pass the laws
954620 back 100 years ago women rose up and said we want the right to vote and they were successful
954621 now you are like the green generation and you are rising up and saying we must ensure the planet does not suffer the worst consequences of climate change
954622 the president of the united states with gas at 4 a gallon because of his failed energy policies is now trying to say that is because i couldnt drill offshore
954623 that is not the cause and i am not going to let him get away with it
954624 we have to get to a place where one day my grandchildren will say do you believe our grandparents had to go with their car and fill up it will be like going with a barrel on our head to a well to get water that will be the equivalent
954625 i told him that this had nothing to do with the gospel we were preaching but he became very aggressive
954626 he said we were in a muslim area and were not allowed to spread our christian message he said we were committing a hate crime by telling the youths to leave islam and said that he was going to take us to the police station
954627 you have been warned if you come back here and get beaten up well you have been warned
954628 it is not clear to me that the europeans are mistaken
954629 when they say that a liberal democracy must take affirmative responsibility for protecting the atmosphere of mutual respect against certain forms of vicious attack
954630 ive had enough of being led by the nose by this whole population which is destroying us and destroying our country by imposing their ways
954631 i will not shut up until stunning is carried out on animals before their ritual slaughter
954632 ngos have been told to scale down or stop operations throughout the country
954633 funds are being channeled through nongovernmental organizations to opposition political parties which are a creation of the west
954634 these western funded ngos also use food as a political weapon with which to campaign against government especially in the rural areas
954635 we are evolving towards majority voting because if we stay with unanimity we will do nothing
954636 it is impossible to function by unanimity with 27 members this time its ireland the next time it will be somebody else
954637 it is going to be very difficult for republicans to run on their stewardship of the economy or their outstanding foreign policy
954638 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid
954639 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
954640 without noting a single supporting piece of evidence obama cast any opposition to him as bigotry
954641 the overall policy question for the board is whether it is good policy for seattle parks to continue public beach fires when the carbon emissions produced by thousands of beach fires per year contributes to global warming

954643 should this country be taken by traitors it is impossible
954644 it shall never happen as long as we are alive and those who fought for the country are alive
954645 we are prepared to fight for our country and to go to war for it
954646 once again we want to make it clear to the british and americans that we are no ones subjects and will never be
954647 this country shall not again come under the rule and control of the white man direct or indirect never ever
954648 the british rule has gone gone for ever the white man is gone never ever will this country be ruled by a white man again
954649 we have a hero in the making back in the united states today because we have a new candidate for president of the united states barack obama
954650 for all of us that have dreams and hope is a hero
954651 it is a known fact that acts of terror have been carried out in the name of islam and it is not illegal to make satire out of this relationship
954652 the danish ruling came as a surprise to the oic at a time when almost all western governments including the usa had made categorical statements rejecting any linkage between islam and terrorism
954653 the linkage drawn by the danish court could create a precedent for exacerbation of islamophobia
954654 i cried all night im going to be crying for the next four years
954655 what barack obama has accomplished is the single most extraordinary event that has occurred in the 232 years of the nations political history the event itself is so extraordinary that another chapter could be added to the bible to chronicle its significance
954656 barack obama has always believed that our courts should stand up for social and economic justice and whats truly elitist is to appoint judges who will protect the powerful and leave ordinary americans to fend for themselves
954657 those who are on the outside those who are vulnerable those who are powerless
954658 but i can trust you because its difficult for me to i cant just tell anyone ok
954659 because the client has admitted he has no valid id and what she should have said then is in that case i cannot help you because i have got to prove your id to satisfy money laundering requirements for my firm and the lender
954660 i can speak to somebody and they can help you to open a bank account and i will give you a call
954661 i will speak to them to see if they can do it without id
954662 following a business review we have decided to terminate cms mortgages whilst we couldnt find specific evidence there are links to and similar patterns to other recent cases where we have had to terminate firms for fraud
954663 we sent the accountant a fax saying we needed an investment income of 50 000 so then the accountant put on his letterhead that my client has an investment income of 50 000 and was able to support the mortgage
954664 they certify it that this is the amount she had and she can support the mortgage
954665 on the original application they always used to disclose as british even though they were not british they were from uganda from nigeria and they told me to mention on every single application that the client was british
954666 and sometimes i challenged them and said this is not right because i want to be trained as a good advisor and what you are doing is not the right way so i was feeling uncomfortable

954668 the boys and girls who live with hiv are here and we are growing up with many goals
954669 we want to be artists teachers doctors even get married and have kids but achieving these goals will only be possible when we receive the attention we need when we are guaranteed the medicines that we need when we are accepted in schools
954670 its like a little ball that has little dots and is inside me sort of swimming inside me
954671 theres a whole new generation of young people that were born with hiv that are reaching adulthood it presents very interesting challenges
954672 they cant talk about their diagnosis in the school because they can be kicked out they cant talk about it in their communities with their neighbors
954673 we need to start getting young people involved in leadership again in hiv and aids because its easy to get kind of complacent
954674 i want to congratulate all the boys and girls who have graduated and got good grades
954675 it had to do with the very specific characteristics in the dna of the letters and what was in bruces labs
954676 no rules so we could do the best and most compelling approaches
954677 clearly the most expensive case fbis ever undertaken and the most scientifically compelling case
954678 marketing got wind of it and nobody at apple is ever allowed to speak publicly about anything without marketing approval
954679 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
954680 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
954681 the profession and the rest of us are better off if sources know that they run the risk of being unmasked if their mendacity is egregious enough to become newsworthy in its own right
954682 id say that part of ross re reporting ought to include a full explanation of exactly who was peddling the bentonite lie in the first place and why they were doing it
954683 in practice most journalists refuse to identify their sources under any circumstances at all even when its clear that those sources deliberately lied to them
954684 when its clear that those sources deliberately lied to them

954689 to begin with let us take the following motto literature is love now we can continue
954690 i can be changed by what happens to me but i refuse to be reduced by it

954693 yesterday is history tomorrow is mystery today is a gift
954694 no one can make you feel inferior without your consent
954695 we have seen job cuts increase in the majority of industries that we track indicating that the downturn which was isolated to the housing and financial sectors just a few months ago has spread throughout much of the economy
954696 the big worry is that the economy will continue to underperform
954697 the housebuilding index indicated that activity in the sector contracted massively in july

954707 nu avem inca statistici foarte corecte dar din ce am citit in presa inteleg ca au fost varfuri de neexplicat omogenizarea pietei imobiliare este benefica si ceea ce trebuie sa ne dea de gandit sunt tocmai acest fracturi in zonele limitrofe ale bucurestiului sunt zone cu 5000 euro metrul patrat iar la doi trei kilometri de 100 euro

954722 women diagnosed with breast cancer face an uphill emotional battle
954723 at a time when they are forced to deal with their own vulnerabilities women with breast cancer must also navigate the vulnerabilities of loved ones as they react to the news
954724 women who limit their emotions in discussing their breast cancer diagnosis often limit the possibilities for support they can receive
954725 involving and including others in an illness increases intimacy among friends and family and opens the door to additional support

954727 yes you may be able to save some trout but there are subtle things that can go on that im not sure that fishermen think about
954728 if you look at pelican colonies around the west theyre kind of boom and bust
954729 these two colonies have had a lot of growth over the years but it was just a matter of time before they crashed
954730 from the data we have 80 to 90 percent of their diet is trash fish
954731 it kind of boils down between a fight between whats most important managing a species of greatest conservation need and appeasing the sportsmen that pay for managing the sport fish
954732 the pelicans have really lined up on the banks and rocks of the blackfoot river
954733 its not the ideal time to stock rainbow trout but its the only time to stock them and survive

954748 doctors are duty bound if they see one of their colleagues doing something untoward to report it mr robertson said
954749 what has happened in this case is that over a two year period between 2004 and 2006 this individual has been allowed on occasion to operate without appropriate supervision mr robertson said
954750 that was a result of a breakdown of communication between the college of surgeons the medical board and indeed queensland health
954751 what this report suggests is that a critical lack of communication between industry and government agencies is putting patients lives at risk mr langbroek said in a statement
954752 the fact that a doctor with serious question marks over his head as to his clinical capability was allowed to operate without any supervision is beyond belief in this post patel era

954755 we know that children and young teens are least likely to be infected with hiv while youth ages 15 24 account for the majority of new infections
954756 the care and protection of these vulnerable children and young people is both a humanitarian imperative and a key to helping them defend against the disease
954757 yet consistently in the 120 countries where save the children works programs for children affected by hiv remain underfunded too many children who should be receiving medical treatment help with school fees support while they care for their sick parents or prevention information do not because too little money is dedicated to helping them
954758 weve always tried to include something for everyone even the youngest fans

954762 if youre talking about someone to take on both jobs then kevin pietersen becomes the number one candidate because hes one of the few people who can be guaranteed their place in both teams
954763 michael vaughans decision is his own decision but i cant believe that paul collingwood made that decision off his own back
954764 clearly they want to unite the job and get one bloke in there and theyve given paul a gentle nudge to say that this is in the best interests of the team
954765 hes been a wonderfully successful captain englands most successful in terms of test match wins and is surely one of englands greatest ever captains
954766 in terms of playing captaining leading decision making michael vaughan is the best man for the job
954767 its a wonderful job but its also a job that becomes all consuming he said hes not been himself at home and wanted to get back to being me
954768 the job gets on top of you its a great job but youre thinking about it all the time
954769 when youre supposed to be at dinner with friends or the wife youre thinking about who should be opening the bowling the next day and how to tell your mate hes not in the next team
954770 that pressure eventually bears down on you and if youre not getting runs as well then it becomes very difficult

954772 we are excited to accept this loan commitment from vanderbilt as we continue to move forward with our project
954773 we anticipate that quite soon we will be in full construction mode
954774 were glad our efforts are improving the environment in the area
954775 the community will see tremendous growth with the project in the coming months and we are looking forward to construction beginning on the townhomes in the near future
954776 today we had very difficult conditions for the race but i managed to choose the right tyres all the team worked really well and my thirteenth place is a big success for me the bike and the entire team
954777 i had a fantastic start and i was able to overtake about five riders in the first curve i managed to stick with rene all the way i just had to hold back a bit at the very end because the front tyre was starting to wear
954778 i was called up at the last minute due to an injury to one of their riders
954779 result wise for the race a top 10 would be nice the triumph is working really well and the chassis is also working well for me so we are just hoping for some good weather and a top 10 finish which would be a good result for the team and also for myself
954780 it was an eventful race with the changeable weather and the red flag for rain which should have come earlier everyone was riding around sticking their hands up in the air for two laps
954781 i am happy with the machine we had one or two problems in the first half of the race so we made some changes for the re start and went better my lap times were very good and i was faster than the four or five riders in front of me but didnt have the time to pass them before the red flag came out once again it was disappointing really because it could easily have been eighth or ninth instead of 11th
954782 i had so many people coming up to me and congratulating me on getting the pole it felt great to have that kind of support theres no question i wasnt 100 percent but overall i felt like i was improving dramatically even during the race weekend i met my goals for mid ohio and im encouraged by my progress i should be back to full strength very soon
954783 ive got some work in front of me no doubt
954784 youre never satisfied with any lead until the season is over but i feel like im in a decent position im recovering quicker than i thought and ive got two weeks before we race again in virginia its probably going to be a good battle to the end just like it was last year
954785 it just wasnt quite there this weekend so at some point we just decided to limit the damage and i think we did that
954786 the worst thing about the weekend was the crash in the superbike race we didnt need that but it was nobodys fault overall we were already struggling to find speed and then had to switch to the backup bike my guys worked so hard this weekend my crew just did a great job some weekends are good and some are bad and this was a tough one but i think we did good just to manage what we did
954787 i cant even squeeze a five pound exercise grip at the moment and it definitely makes it tough to throw the bike around here i know in my head i can get the bike into the corners better but i physically could not do it im pretty sore but we just needed to get some points
954788 unfortunately in the race i came off the back straightaway and i thought there was something wrong with the engine
954789 but im happy to be on a motorcycle and happy to be racing again i got myself in a little battle with some of the guys which was kind of fun from here well go to the atlanta test and weve got some time to heal up before vir but its difficult when you know you can beat these guys and run in the top five but your hand is screwed up were ninth in the championship five out of eighth and 12 out of seventh and i think i can get those guys top seven wouldnt be too bad considering
954790 i got another good start like yesterday and at the beginning i was fighting with my teammate for a couple of laps
954791 the bike was great and i really want to thank the team my mechanics suzuki and pirelli
954792 i was on the front row and i got a really good start
954793 i was second going into the first corner but those guys were going good all weekend long and i didnt know how long i was going to be able to run up there if i was even going to be able to run up there i didnt have too much of a game plan i just wanted to see how it played out i got comfortable out there and made some charges but i couldnt quite beat aaron on this day my tires held up great for me this weekend pirelli really came through
954794 its a tough tough day but i guess these things happen if you stay around long enough
954795 i also want to thank neils guys for really helping my guys put the bike back together for me they all worked hard
954796 i normally screw up qualifying and manage to squeeze myself onto the second row so its the first time ive been on the front row all year so im well pleased
954797 we have two but a lot of times we dont have enough people to run them
954798 in some communities out there its the volunteer fire department or nothing
954799 theres not the economic base to support a career department so if they cant keep the volunteer fire department viable then the potential exists that theyre not going to have any protection at all
954800 your mom and your dad was in the fire service and their parents were in the fire service and it just goes on from generation to generation
954801 it makes you wonder where well be 20 years from now

954813 i see it as a real positive for our playing group and our club to have somebody of bens standard as a footballer to set an example on the training track and its great for our young players coming through
954814 ben really wants to be a part of the playing group he really wants to get back into the club environment and wants to see where hes at from a footballing perspective
954815 from meetings with ben ive been really impressed by what he wanted to do and what he wanted to achieve by being with us
954816 you see the condition hes in currently hes well and truly preparing himself
954817 hes an absolute professional and he was always classified as one of the best trainers at west coast and its the kind of workmanlike mentality he has that will set him up well and truly for next year

954822 the sanction imposed on heath by the club on monday was a result of information stated by both heath and alan after being repeatedly questioned about the incident
954823 given the club has now found their information to be false it strikes at the principles of honesty and integrity that the collingwood football club is built on
954824 for this reason the sanction imposed will be immediately reviewed by the club and media will be notified of a press conference to be held on tuesday
954825 i rang him and then i saw him walking down and then because there was a bit of a crowd around me i just told him to go because i didnt really need him there at that point

954910 el comisionado para el mercado del tabaco ha prohibido la venta en los estancos de un nuevo producto conocido como tabaco sin humo bajo la marca similar smoke free por considerar que no es un producto derivado del tabaco el comisionado que se pronunci en este sentido hace unas semanas considera que la marca similar smoke free no puede considerarse un producto del tabaco al no cumplir con legislaci n vigente que entr en vigor el enero de 2006 de medidas contra el tabaquismo en esta normativa se definen a los productos del tabaco como aquello destinado a ser fumados inhalados chupados o masticados que est n constituidos aunque s lo sea en parte por tabaco el comisionado indica que la nicotina es un producto que se encuentra en la planta del tabaco y que el hecho de encontrar esta sustancia en un producto aislado no le convierte en una labor de tabaco

954917 israel acts by the law of war and seriously prepares to attack irans nuclear objects
954918 iranian nuclear weapons endanger the existence of the state of israel even if the weapons are used with the deterrent value only
954919 the effects of the violent disaster at altamont was that it exposed the dark underbelly of the counter culture the dark forces that had always provided at least half of its propulsion and to burst the bubble of the youth cultures illusions about itself we had witnessed the famous collectivity of a generation cracking into thousands of shards it represented the end of the age of aquarius
954920 and no one knew what new age would replace it
954921 the biggest issue around nanotechnology is that we dont know all of its risks were putting things on the market that havent been fully tested
954922 the nanotech boom is generating an unprecedented number of new processes and materials that pose unknown potential environmental and health hazards
954923 the potential pulmonary toxicity of certain nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes is significant requiring a better understanding of exposure to further evaluate their risk
954924 this isnt a technology we want to say no to but its a technology we want to move safely and intelligently into the future
954925 what we have to consider with new physical properties is that theres likely to be a new toxicology profile we have to consider that and do more testing before people are exposed or its released into the environment
954926 those are the issues that need to be addressed and theyre just not on the table right now
954927 people are concerned about manmade nanoparticles in the environment and there is certainly reason to be careful and not do anything foolish but on the other hand human beings arent the only nanotechnologists on earth there are thousands of species of animals that synthesize nanoparticles and our environment is filled with nanoparticles we just didnt know it until we had tools that could see them
954928 we want to look at our technology road map and see what risks there might be with any of the materials well use so we can take steps to minimize them
954929 these are so tightly locked down that theres no way the nanoparticles can get out you can beat on them with a hammer and they still wont get out
954930 the available data support the ability of the lung gastrointestinal tract and skin to act as a significant barrier to the systemic exposure of many nanomaterials furthermore the acute systemic toxicity of many nanomaterials appear to be low
954931 theres no question that well find uses for nanotechnology that well take for granted 10 or 20 years from now that we cant even think about now
954932 we live with the results of research and microscopy every day from the lightness of the clothes we wear to fillings in our teeth and metal on our glasses but few people are exposed to where this research comes from
954933 with small matters we enter a privileged world that people outside microscopy and biological sciences rarely see
954934 its incredibly rich imagery no matter what you look at
954935 with each new generation of sensors and computers microscopy just accelerates and we are able to generate and manipulate data so much quicker
954936 these tools are really opening up and researchers can progress so much more quickly in their understanding the next generation of scientists is going to be very busy
954937 we are very much looking at three dimensional images and achieving that in many ways many techniques are now working in the fourth dimension time to see how living cells and other dynamic systems change
954938 plant use in prehistory and how it changed the world
954939 the hidden world of nature 400 years of discover with microscopes

954945 i hope he will be ready to start training next week but he will not play until he is in good condition
954946 this provides a significant new way of interacting with cultured cells
954947 the microstructures can be used to capture individual cells and once isolated clonal colonies of those cells can be grown and studied
954948 they moved around the space like they were running around a racetrack
954949 its a little bit like a three dimensional etch a sketch
954950 the flash memory type of system where you could effectively take days worth of video on a form factor thats the size of todays thumb drives that would be an obvious application
954951 by having people act as local nodes on a network as well where their pda or their cellphone has sensors in it in that way as theyre walking around they are essentially sampling the environment themselves
954952 the northern and eastern africa sub regions continue to grow faster with over 14 percent increase in passenger volume compared to 2006 while the western africa sub region has a growth rate of only 7 percent
954953 some airports have double digit growth rate while others barely keep the traffic volume of the previous year yet the overall picture of africas air traffic remains one growing above the world level
954954 it is only through the consistent improvement in the services at our airports with assured safety and security that we can support the growth of this vital industry
954955 in our diversity as african states we need to compromise on our individual interest if we are to achieve the larger goals of the continent within the world
954956 since then senator mccain has only upped the ante smearing mr obama every which way from sundown on wednesday
954957 for four days senator john mccain and his allies have accused senator barack obama of snubbing wounded soldiers by canceling a visit to a military hospital because he could not take reporters with him despite no evidence that the charge is true
954958 the racial fantasy factor in this presidential campaign is out of control it was at work in that new yorker cover that caused such a stir mr obama in muslim garb with the american flag burning in the fireplace its driving the idea that barack obama is somehow presumptuous too arrogant too big for his britches a man who obviously does not know his place mr obama has to endure these grotesque insults with a smile and heroic levels of equanimity the reason he has to do this the sole reason is that he is black
954959 they go there work and get some money for themselves and pay their school fees and buy uniforms since this is the fishing season in cote divoire they will get work to do

955070 it was while we were looking for a new singer for pulse ultra that the idea of making an instrumental rock album came about
955071 after recording with pulse ultra i would go back to the studio with joey bastone and jam it felt great i did what i wanted without being told to stop or have a group discussion with a band joey just backed me up
955072 a lot of the songs are based on my dreams
955073 i would have these dreams then spend hours in the studio recording and i would come home and have these crazy thoughts it scared me

955212 doctors are duty bound if they see one of their colleagues doing something untoward to report it mr robertson said
955213 what has happened in this case is that over a two year period between 2004 and 2006 this individual has been allowed on occasion to operate without appropriate supervision mr robertson said
955214 that was a result of a breakdown of communication between the college of surgeons the medical board and indeed queensland health
955215 what this report suggests is that a critical lack of communication between industry and government agencies is putting patients lives at risk mr langbroek said in a statement
955216 the fact that a doctor with serious question marks over his head as to his clinical capability was allowed to operate without any supervision is beyond belief in this post patel era

955222 we dont know many of the dogs histories and the massage really calms them down and allows them to get used to the human touch
955223 it also really improves the dogs blood circulation which is so important in winter when it is very cold
955224 awl found that calming the dogs had a greater benefit to their wellbeing and increases the speed and success of their adoption and re homing
955225 once the dogs have had a massage they are more responsive and the calming effect increases with each subsequent massage

955230 it is with great sadness that we learned craig passed away in the early hours the teams thoughts are with craigs family and friends at this very difficult time his family pass on their thanks to all well wishers
955231 i am so desperately sad that craig died from the injuries he sustained at brands hatch yesterday
955232 he was a really super young guy and only on the saturday evening was i chatting to him in the paddock with him telling me about his wsb ambitions for 2009 craig was so determined and professional would always say hello and enthusiastically keep me in touch with his progress
955233 britain has lost a wonderful rider whom i admired enormously and had every chance of being a future world champion it is fitting that the abiding memory so many of us will have of craig was him riding brilliantly battling for the lead of an incredible race in front of his home crowd it seems barely believable that such a freak accident claimed his life and i extend my deepest sympathies to his family and friends

955245 there was a lot of shouting and pushing people fell down and could not get up they just suffocated
955246 the police did not allow people to step back meanwhile people started coming down from above shouting go back go back
955247 since the police did not allow the people to go back this tragedy happened
955248 it takes time and privacy especially working out the methods which i wouldnt have guessed anyone really knew in the lab at that time
955249 the changes really began to accelerate in the last year he would sit at his desk weeping
955250 he really couldnt do his work any more the pressure was tremendous
955251 people given these kinds of responsibilities with this kind of power at their fingertips we have to make sure that they are not likely to do harm to others or misuse that authority be it intentionally or be it because of some mental problem
955252 these kinds of situations cry out for reexamination of our standards
955253 youre basically going to scare off any scientist from wanting to work in this field if it becomes even more stringent
955254 it is a balance its a policy decision about how stringent we want to be

955261 they wouldnt have died like that if they had allowed the refugees to pass through their lines
955262 the u s military hardly took into consideration a risk that its massive bombing and incineration operations could take heavy tolls on civilians
955263 across a stream there were u s soldiers with a tank they blocked us
955264 my feelings were indescribable because not all of us could go

955281 well there comes a time when my mentor and i get to compete and i guess thats whats going to happen
955282 if thats what happens then im going to give it my best shot and leave the rest up to coach
955283 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate
955284 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
955285 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
955286 im excited its good to have him back in the house
955287 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
955288 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
955289 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
955290 its an honor to be able to wear the fastest suit known to mankind
955291 ive worn a speedo my entire life from age seven to 23 ive always worn it and its the only thing i know speedo has always been a part of my life
955292 when watching the highlights of tiger or roger seeing the highlights of those guys and how they carry themselves and how consistent they are
955293 were all the same way im a creature of habit im sure they go about every tournament or match as if its the biggest theyre probably the same as me i dont like to lose and they dont either
955294 i dont think anything is too high you never know what can happen
955295 the only person i can worry about is myself if i can prepare the best i can thats all i can ask
955296 its rare to be able to find a coach athlete combination that work together so well
955297 right now im more relaxed than i was in 04 going through everything in the past four years has helped me prepare better for these games
955298 last time i was a deer in headlights i had never gotten that much attention from media
955299 when i am away from the pool usually im on my couch watching tv playing video games and sleeping
955300 the argument came from when it started raining real hard then we were trying to blame one another for the idea of coming onto pit road
955301 bob said it was my idea and i really felt like it was his idea i had to leave the pit box because i was worried bob was going to like punch me in the neck or something
955302 its not out of the ordinary for us to argue
955303 we get mad at each other we walk away and then we walk back together and calmer heads prevail and we have a discussion
955304 i was really nervous that we made the wrong call there
955305 bobs the smartest guy in the world we were really arguing we made light of it but we thought we made the wrong call
955306 if it keeps raining we win it didnt and we got seventh
955307 i was concerned at the three eighths pole and i thought we were beat turning for home
955308 but he got down on his belly and he won
955309 he found a new gear and just kept sticking his neck out
955310 at the top of the stretch that horse took off but big brown just kept coming and i knew wed get him at the three sixteenths pole he switched leads and then at the eighth pole he took off again
955311 he showed his heart and courage which was a side of him i hadnt seen until today
955312 its very rough when things go right for you and you dont get the win
955313 i thought we had a hell of a shot turning for home
955314 we could do this again i am very happy right now we made him run thats for sure big brown looked great in the paddock and when he broke but down the backside i got excited coal play ran a big race
955315 big brown always won his other races with such ease
955316 its been about 60 days of nervousness i had a dream last night that he won but this race was a lot closer than the one in my dream were thrilled
955317 hes a top horse it was a little more than i was expecting he really struggled out there to run this horse down but zitos horse ran great
955318 i think right now rick will evaluate him and well plan a sensible campaign
955319 if it was up to me i wouldnt run him back so quick
955320 psychologically it has to be very good because we just got swept three series
955321 ever since we got these guys its made an impression
955322 the speed that we got any ball up the middles not going to go through anymore were going to give some teams some pressure from now on
955323 with that shortstop and second baseman theyre a different club much different club than we saw last time they have lots more energy more life more creativity
955324 i finished it up the way i wanted to with a strikeout thats how i envisioned it i didnt picture the home run in there but thats all right
955325 were beating ourselves were obviously not getting hits theyre making every single play in the field and were making none
955326 im very happy with the way we played this series because we played clean baseball
955327 we wanted to see guys catching the ball and guys going all out and putting everything into it

955330 es rgert mich wahnsinnig dass das bild des vereins und der fans in katastrophaler weise besch digt wurde die wahrnehmung ist dass alle unsere fans gewaltbereit sind aber das stimmt ja eigentlich gar nicht

955342 there is a lot of misunderstanding between women whether to stay at home with your children or whether you work most women dont even have that choice but it worries me that theres a lot of animosity between women on this issue
955343 it was huge it was heart rending these people approached me and they made such an incredible offer i really wrestled with it but i really felt i didnt have a choice
955344 im going to try to find my grandparents house in ruddles mill bourbon county i spent every summer with them my grandfather was a sharecropper its been such a long time since i was there its going to be eerie

955347 something were going to see more of over the next six to 12 months
955348 you have had minimum wage go up again commodity prices continue to go up were in a softening consumer market where the consumer is less willing to accept the price increases than they might have been in the past the companies are having to eat the cost difference
955349 all these bar and grill concepts are very very similar
955350 we are not having fun and we are getting bumped and bruised

955394 integrated visibility and control over the movement of inventory and assets across todays complex global supply networks can be slow costly and very challenging in the past inventory and the assets used to ship them were tracked in two separate systems which made closed loop tracking of assets very difficult with the new release customers can manage this combined movement through a single process driving greater efficiency improved visibility and stronger control over supply chain operations
955395 being able to manage inventory and assets in a single system provides inherent efficiencies there are significant costs tied up in reusable assets used in distribution operations it makes sense to track these along with the inventory they transport for a complete view of the supply chain in motion

955449 we are quite certain that there is at least one large liquid filled lake on titan
955450 the measurements carried out with the vims spectrometer on board the cassini space probe are all point in the same direction close to titans south polar region we have discovered a lake filled with liquid ethane the lake contains natural gas in a more or less liquid state
955451 these can only have been created under the influence of stream erosion
955452 in the meantime we have discovered such valley systems in many other places on titan by using the spectrometer and the radar instrument
955453 our analyses show that at least from time to time considerable amounts of liquids must have flowed through these valleys
955454 we are inclined to consider precipitation as the most likely source of the liquids as the branched valley systems extend over wide areas and do not originate from single sources but the question can only be answered conclusively by further measurements which we have planned during the next two years

955829 in thyolo district malawi one nurse keeps 400 patients alive by following up their essential treatment but her basic salary amounts to just 3 a day
955830 it is intolerable to then be told by governments and donor countries that it is unsustainable to raise her wages even though she is responsible for 7 500 worth of drugs a month for her patients those willing to support funding for medicines must find ways to cover recurrent costs like salaries for health workers
955831 it is devastating to stand by and watch people growing sicker and sometimes dying as they wait weeks and even months before being treated simply because there are not enough health care workers
955832 overworked underpaid and undervalued health care workers in southern africa are increasingly scarce just as the number of hiv patients is rising antiretrovirals may be present on more hospital and clinic shelves but without the health staff to administer them a deadly gap will only grow wider
955833 es gibt verschiedene fahrstile und die berholman ver in der motogp sind anders als bei den superbikes

955838 ich denke wir m ssen an unserer haltbarkeit und an der qualifying performance arbeiten wobei das sicher nicht die einzigen punkte sind

955842 we are sending out requests today to outlets and shops to pull the games off their shelves and we will replace them with other games
955843 we are also urging video game arcades to pull the games from service
955844 he said he wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game
955845 this time bomb has already exploded and the situation could get worse
955846 today it is a cab driver but tomorrow it could be a video game shop owner
955847 we left our houses because we had no power to resist the taliban or the government
955848 anytime the taliban fired a shot from our houses then the coalition the government and the police came to the area and hit us
955849 the government comes and arrests us and then the taliban come and arrest us as well
955850 there was fighting in the village a hundred times roadside bombs bombardment firing and shooting
955851 the taliban are coming during the night with heavy weapons riding on vehicles and we cannot even dare ask them to leave because if they see someone at night outside they will slaughter them and accuse them of being spies
955852 israeli authorities halted the process however as they received information that they were being arrested by hamas and that their lives were in immediate danger
955853 he just went out there and was standing out there
955854 that was kind of funny he was moving his chin and looked like he was talking but he wasnt saying nothing
955855 i was mentally prepared to go five or six innings
955856 we had an afternoon game in milwaukee on thursday and we get in late and have a day game on friday
955857 there are certain times during the course of a season where exceptions should be made for night games on weekends
955858 well see it makes sense to me it would help the situation from a winning and losing standpoint
955859 but then it started getting a little more consistent when he finished up
955860 whats important is how it feels monday if it feels fine we can step it up and get him ready to pitch
955861 i see it as a real positive for our playing group and our club to have somebody of bens standard as a footballer to set an example on the training track and its great for our young players coming through
955862 ben really wants to be a part of the playing group he really wants to get back into the club environment and wants to see where hes at from a footballing perspective
955863 from meetings with ben ive been really impressed by what he wanted to do and what he wanted to achieve by being with us
955864 you see the condition hes in currently hes well and truly preparing himself
955865 hes an absolute professional and he was always classified as one of the best trainers at west coast and its the kind of workmanlike mentality he has that will set him up well and truly for next year
955866 if youre talking about someone to take on both jobs then kevin pietersen becomes the number one candidate because hes one of the few people who can be guaranteed their place in both teams
955867 michael vaughans decision is his own decision but i cant believe that paul collingwood made that decision off his own back
955868 clearly they want to unite the job and get one bloke in there and theyve given paul a gentle nudge to say that this is in the best interests of the team
955869 hes been a wonderfully successful captain englands most successful in terms of test match wins and is surely one of englands greatest ever captains
955870 in terms of playing captaining leading decision making michael vaughan is the best man for the job
955871 its a wonderful job but its also a job that becomes all consuming he said hes not been himself at home and wanted to get back to being me
955872 the job gets on top of you its a great job but youre thinking about it all the time
955873 when youre supposed to be at dinner with friends or the wife youre thinking about who should be opening the bowling the next day and how to tell your mate hes not in the next team
955874 that pressure eventually bears down on you and if youre not getting runs as well then it becomes very difficult
955875 i have the highest regard for him as person sportsman and leader it is a great loss for world cricket
955876 hendra virus is very rare and the circumstances surrounding this outbreak even rarer
955877 matters relating to business continuity are a commercial decision for the individual business
955878 what we are doing is beyond what legislation outlines during a disease outbreak but this is an extraordinary case and the ava and the government are responding to it as such
955879 theyve given us the means to try to work something out
955880 the sanction imposed on heath by the club on monday was a result of information stated by both heath and alan after being repeatedly questioned about the incident
955881 given the club has now found their information to be false it strikes at the principles of honesty and integrity that the collingwood football club is built on
955882 for this reason the sanction imposed will be immediately reviewed by the club and media will be notified of a press conference to be held on tuesday
955883 i rang him and then i saw him walking down and then because there was a bit of a crowd around me i just told him to go because i didnt really need him there at that point
955884 heath has said that alan was not in the car with him
955885 i didnt even know the game was on nbc its nice to hear the people on the island got a chance to see it that makes it even more special
955886 ive had bad luck throughout this whole draft process trying to get into this league and i think i dont know if it was karma or what but i had a lot of things fall into place
955887 everything kind of developed whenever we called plays to go up top the colts kind of ran the coverages we needed them to run i was happy to be able to go out there and have fun and have success doing it
955888 the one that really set the tone was my first third down pass when i threw that corner route right after that i remember all of the butterflies were gone this is something i know how to do i just went out and had fun
955889 it was one of those things where i knew from pre snap what the coverage was going to be i was torn between what i wanted to do i ended up looking to the outside receiver to see if anything opened up i was going to come back inside i saw him flash open i know in that defense theres kind of a middle linebacker dropping off in coverage as i went to throw it at the last second i saw him and i remember trying to put the ball up high and away from him as possible and try to get it in as fast as possible at the same time really i just got lucky on that play
955890 ive had kind of a tight hamstring this last week
955891 the coolest thing what ill never forget when i went in i got a huge ovation by the crowd even before we started play a lot of people were standing up and clapping there was kind of this roar that got started when i went on the field like people were really excited to see me play i remember when that happened i was really excited to play i was praying to have a good start to my career thank god it just worked out for me
955892 i didnt even know the game was on nbc its nice to hear the people on the island got a chance to see it that makes it even more special
955893 ive had bad luck throughout this whole draft process trying to get into this league and i think i dont know if it was karma or what but i had a lot of things fall into place

955984 these are strictly my personal views and im sorry if i hurt anyones religious sentiments for i strongly believe spirituality is for the heart not the brain and it has the capability to manipulate human emotions
955985 if the government doesnt seem knowledgeable and committed to establishing figures who else is arrival at the number 27 has not been justified and a democratic government holds a responsibility to clarify to the nation

956008 in our opinion the indicative proposal of a 4 40 a share is a low balled bid that significantly undervalues asciano
956009 given all the noise around asciano many market participants have largely forgotten the strategic positioning and value of ascianos asset base and hence allowed the stock to trade down to levels well below fair value

956029 i believe that beijings olympics are now facing real threats from terrorist attacks
956030 i think the olympics are the most important international sports event in four years
956031 and its the biggest focus of the international media in four years so this might draw some attention from terrorist groups
956032 the threat remains moderate but slightly elevated because of the olympics
956033 the chinese have been on these people a long time
956034 the surveillance system deployed by china for the olympics which includes key pieces of western technology is the most comprehensive and sophisticated surveillance system ever
956035 properly used it will definitely increase security at the olympics and western companies will have contributed to that security
956036 whereas the legacy of previous olympics was sports stadiums the legacy of the beijing olympics will be a high tech police state
956037 they had some gaps there and i just took advantage of them the ball found me and i was able to make them pay

956040 russia did a good job of slowing us down a little bit but we still made our run at the end of the third quarter
956041 if you take a look in past games the american team most points they score is fast breaks and its dunks i think for the most part we contained the ball
956042 for the most part i think we did a pretty good job to stop them
956043 russia is a team we could see in the gold medal game and a team thats been playing very well of late so it was good competition they made us run some sets slow us down a little bit but i think overall we played good defense

956090 the presidency has noted todays sunday front page article of the sunday times headlined mbeki took r30m and gave some to anc president jacob zuma
956091 the report which purports to be a result of a six months investigation is but a hotch potch recycling of allegations that have from time to time been peddled against the governments strategic defence procurement package
956092 this time the sunday times outdoes itself by placing a spurious allegation in the public domain that president thabo mbeki received a bribe of r30m from man ferrostaal
956093 the presidency would like to place it on record that president thabo mbeki has never at any stage received any amount of money from man ferrostaal
956094 the sunday times or anyone who has evidence that the president or anyone else received bribe s in the procurement process should as we have emphasised before approach the law enforcement agencies

956097 leider sind normale bassdrum mikros meist nicht in der lage die extrem tiefen frequenzen abzubilden
956098 first ive seen this device on the 15 bass cabinet at the phil collins concert asked the guitar tech about it and then heared it at the soundcheck then in a small club here withg one of the worst pas ever the drummer brought this for the kick drum the result was that ive never heared a kick drum to sound so great extreme low end and decent click to make it always present in the stomack and in the ears i must say that a studio without the subkick will always have a big minus of quality below 100hz
956099 buena park ca since its introduction the yamaha subkick has received a number of positive reviews not only by drummers but also in the recording production and sound reinforcement markets
956100 if youre looking for beef this thing will give it to you in abundance
956101 although the subkick was initially created as a drummers accessory were not at all surprised that the professional audio community has really embraced this product given the fact that its basically a microphone
956102 its a great accessory whether youre a drummer or an engineer
956103 the subkick is not a mic or a drum its both
956104 i was looking for a way to capture the actual uncolored sound of my kick both on tape and while playing live since a mic placed in a common position really doesnt capture everything i combined some of the characteristics of a drum and the idea of using a speaker as an extremely large mic diaphragm the yamaha subkick was born

956136 we commend all of the schools we name this year as our regional best colleges primarily for their excellent academic programs said robert franek princeton reviews vice president of publishing
956137 we selected them based on institutional data we collected from several hundred schools in each region our visits to schools over the years and the opinions of independent and high school based college advisors whose recommendations we invite
956138 we also take into account what each schools customers their students report to us about their campus experiences

956165 there has been high level engagement between the chinese and indian governments to facilitate co operation between the two countries when investing acquiring overseas oil assets as far as we understand this never resulted in a formal agreement but rather an informal memorandum of understanding of sorts both companies have a declared appetite for oil assets especially those that offer good production growth in many ways imperials portfolio is tailor made for either or both so it is not inconceivable that ongc majority government owned and sinopec an arm of the government team up to avoid competing against each other we note that neither company has ever consummated a foreign corporate takeover of a listed entity
956166 summing up our risk based calculation of the potential value of imperial energy suggests the possibility of an attractive return on the shares at this stage we believe the shares are only a moderate fundamental value proposition but the optionality of the deal makes them significantly more interesting
956167 the games industry does not appear to have been affected by the consumer slowdown in the uk to date implying some countercyclical qualities to the game business model competitive threats also appear overdone with pricing remaining relatively stable at present we view the risk from digital downloading as a long term concern and unlikely to affect forecasts for this cycle

956172 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests

956179 customer research allows you to understand and take into account the behaviours and motivations of your customers and their contexts it reuires you to do away with reductive thinking and get out into their lives and talk to them then make this newfound understanding of your customers an integral part of your entire organisation
956180 it is this uncertainty and miscellany that renders more traditional approaches to product and service delivery insufficient you cant simply analyse your way to success you cannt optimise your way to profitability focusing on risk mitigation allows maverick competitors to surpass you as markets peoples lives and the world are becoming more complex many of the old easy answers to business problems are insufficient developing creative agile and expreience focused approaches will be a key business practice for small and large companies alike

956210 several national restaurant chains were shuttered on tuesday possibly offering a early taste of whats in store this year for businesses that depend on free spending consumers whose budgets are now being squeezed
956211 this is the real deal the blues the way its supposed to be played
956212 yo stacey come down here and say it to my fucking face you fuckin vagina
956213 yes i think that your story um evokes henry miller i actually think that its henry miller lite no but seriously seriously because in your story all your women you basically turn them into these nameless faceless body part whores your main character jasmine she like opens up madelaines world by giving her the best fucking orgasm shes ever had which i dont know if you know this is the primary sex act that two women can actually have and then you go ahead and you belittle it by turning it into pornography and i think that the reason why youre doing this is because men cant handle it the fact that these women can have this amazing fucking beautiful mind blowing orgasm without a fucking cock
956214 every time i think everythings going really well i mean i try really hard it all fucks up and i think that maybe im just one of those people that doesnt deserve to be happy
956215 um im just on my way to the grocery store um to get some bread for toast ive uh ive forgotten my wallet and my keys so im just gonna go get them
956216 will you cut my hair short i just feel like i need to change

956222 the hp2 sport is a bike designed for riders with an ultimate passion for sports riding with numerous cutting edge sports design features and a high performance engine this model is really leading the way for bmw sport production motorcycles the bike is indicative of the brand shift that we have taken over recent years whilst maintaining the uncompromising standards expected of bmw motorrad
956223 we have begun testing the new specification of tyre to get ahead of the game before the new regulations come into force
956224 one of the crucial factors when developing a tyre for a series such as the world touring cars is to ensure that the benefits are equal for front and rear wheel drive cars
956225 the track owners did a fantastic job of ensuring we had consistent conditions throughout the test
956226 we compared the new tyre against the old version and found improvements in outright grip steering response and overall handling both on the front and rear wheel drive cars the drivers also reported a more secure feeling from the chassis with the new tyre in all conditions
956227 we also ran the tyres on a drying track and again found comparable improvements between the front and rear wheel drive cars the new tyre at least matched the current version in terms of performance and longevity on a drying track so we are pleased with the results of this first test it certainly appears that the new wet weather tyre is an improvement over the current version
956228 thanks to the growing demand for the octavia we are looking for suitable manufacturing capacities elsewhere that will enable us to quickly react to the enormous interest shown by customers in our model range
956229 with this car we wanted to emphasise the performance potential of the 6 75 litre v12 engine and the effortless experience that it delivers whilst never overtly sporty rolls royce is a brand that has always offered owners a powerful and refined drive combined with as sir henry royce described it a bit of fizz
956230 this new model represents an important milestone in the companys history it completes the phantom family and judging by the customer reaction to 101ex we are confident of its success our challenge lies in meeting the exceptional levels of customer demand for the phantom range and in preparing goodwood to meet the needs of future new cars

956232 the presidential gets a lot of attention but in fact the senate races are very high on our priority list as well
956233 how we mark out our campaign plan so they go into the voting booth with as much information as possible about who john mccain is and how president obama will stand with workers
956234 change which have driven his campaign from the start mccain will be trading on his experience
956235 sen obamas background as a community organizer means he understands the value of reaching in florida communities to talk about his vision for turning the page on the failed politics of the past
956236 in honor of sen obamas birthday our volunteers will talk to their neighbors to share the story of his lifetime a story of bringing people together to create positive change as a community organizer a civil rights lawyer a constitutional law professor a state ssenator and now a u s senator
956237 sen obamas background as a community organizer means he understands the value of reaching in florida communities

956246 nestle will face swift legal challenge if it does not fully evaluate the environmental impact of diverting millions of gallons of spring water from the mccloud river into billions of plastic water bottles
956247 they should be places you go to get better not get cancer
956248 whatever we can do to make this country a smoke free zone we should do it
956249 the new york yankees have a 2008 payroll of approximately 208 million under the twin obama tax proposals the 24 yankee players would be hit with an aggregate increase in federal income taxes of just over 22 million with slugger alex rodriguez single handedly getting dunned with 2 6 million in additional federal taxes the owner of the yankees would owe an additional 7 5 million of federal taxes ticket prices would need to be increased by about 65 million so that the owner and players could have the same after tax income as before the increase in ticket prices would amount to an average 16 per ticket given that the least expensive ticket in yankee stadium currently is 14 this would more than double the cost of a seat in the bleachers
956250 we bought the films rights at a high rate since the film was expected to be a smashing success
956251 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
956252 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
956253 individual or leader in the u s to speak for you on issues of race
956254 the black community is at least as traditional in its views as the larger american public
956255 the oil companies need to know that there is a limit on how much profit they can take in this economy
956256 what has been unusual is that it has been the u s and afghanistan that have spoken the loudest on pakistans involvement in the embassy attack
956257 this has been good for india because it spreads the credibility net much further
956258 the isi is headed by a serving army general all senior officer decision and policy makers are on deputation from the army
956259 most of the current top brass in the army including army chief general kiyani have served in or commanded the isi
956260 no prime minister in the past had succeeded in weaning the isi away from in practice army control
956261 identify the culprits perpetrators organizers and financiers of the assassination
956262 the jury heard all of the evidence the case was conducted fairly and without reversible error
956263 at norml we have always taken the position that there is absolutely nothing wrong with the responsible use of marijuana by adults and this proposal incorporates that principle into federal law
956264 once we recognize that the criminal justice approach is not helpful or useful for drug abusers we will develop good programs to help these people who need help but to leave alone those millions of citizens who live law abiding lives but who enjoy smoking a joint when they relax in the evening just as millions of other americans enjoy a glass of wine or a cocktail in the evening
956265 h r 5843 would simply remove the threat of arrest and the host of consequences that can come with an arrest at the federal level including the possible loss of student financial aid housing assistance food stamps voting rights and in some cases prison for simple possession or nonprofit transfer of small amounts of marijuana
956266 what the bill would do is limit big governments role in marijuana policy and put that responsibility more in the hands of the states
956267 the fda has concluded that no sound scientific studies support the medical use of marijuana for treatment in the united states and that no data exist to support the safety or efficacy of marijuana for general medical use
956268 there are alternative fda approved medications in existence for treatment of many of the proposed uses of smoked marijuana
956269 the levels of thc in marijuana have reached the highest recorded amounts ever since scientific analysis of the drug began in the late 1970s
956270 the increased potency of marijuana is a contributing factor to the substantial increase in the number of american teenagers in treatment for marijuana dependence
956271 this increase in potency has also been linked to increased risks for mental health disorders including psychosis and schizophrenia
956272 even congressman frank has stated publicly that the chances of this legislation passing are not high
956273 but instead of solutions john mccain is offering gimmicks americans deserve better
956274 our members know that gas prices are not going to be going down in the long run in the long run the trajectory is up so we need real solutions that will allow americans cheap and clean energy to power our future
956275 that also means we need to call out gimmicks like offshore drilling that do nothing to move us toward that clean energy future
956276 just this week big oil companies bp exxonmobil chevron are reporting yet another quarter of billions in record breaking profits actually outstripping even last years record profits
956277 conocophillips netted 5 4 billion bp pulled in 9 5 billion and today exxonmobil and shell announced profits of 11 68 billion and 11 6 respectively to put that into perspective that is about 800 in profit over the course of a year for every driver in america
956278 sen obama will take on the oil companies and end the choke hold they have on our economy and on our politics
956279 sen mccains plan is just more of the same hes proposing measures that will continue these obscene profits by the oil companies that we see today and do very little to help average americans
956280 a day after barack obama told voters to inflate their tires and reject domestic exploration his special interest friends are echoing his anti drilling message on tv
956281 attacking john mccains solutions to americas energy crisis and offering nothing but tire maintenance advice will not reduce prices at the pump
956282 special interest groups that oppose america maximizing its own natural resources hope obama wins but voters who want lower gas prices will support mccain
956283 there are things that you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing s but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
956284 profit is a sign that a company is doing something right
956285 its using its resources effectively and its shareholders are getting value out of their investment
956286 there has been a continual drum beat from house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid and there has been vote after vote to put a windfall profits tax on these companies or to take away the tax cuts that were given a few years ago to corporations
956287 it would make as much sense to punish people who havent invested in the oil companies
956288 the people who have invested in the oil companies are making it possible for us to get gasoline when we go to the service station people may say prices are too high but if more people had invested in oil companies then there would be more investment in new fields and new refineries and new pipelines and prices would be lower
956289 its just a last ditch effort to keep the scumbag breathing
956290 he never should have been breathing in the first place i dont care i really dont care what anyone thinks about this except texas i love texas texas is in my blood
956291 displayed a callous cruel and cavalier attitude toward the two girls that he had raped and helped to murder surely no juror or judge will ever forget his words or his sordid deeds
956292 im where i am because i made an adolescent choice thats it
956293 my life is in black and white like old western movies
956294 but unlike the movies the good guys dont always finish first
956295 most of our friends abroad have long since come to the conclusion that this country on this topic just doesnt get it
956296 this state is seen as uncaring and hateful and this case is just right on the top
956297 most texans however consider death a just penalty in certain rare circumstances many europeans disagree so be it
956298 unfortunately i doubt that the international community is likely to brush this off as simply the actions of texas in the international community and under all u s treaty obligations the united states is responsible for texas actions
956299 theyre never allowed to block a fire hydrant but they do it
956300 i believe hes a big kid or he wouldnt go around intimidating people who are just doing their job
956301 i think the proliferation of video technology does in some sense level the playing field
956302 when we think about the citizen eyewitnesses that have brought to light some egregious police conduct that no one would have believed the benefit is unquestionable
956303 hes going to have to be very careful not to bow to public pressure and not bow to emotion
956304 or if you have to get a new cellphone get one with a video function
956305 send it in to your local authorities or post it on youtube or other video sharing sites
956306 you can call it a vendetta if you want because thats what it is
956307 its about the citys predatory policy of ticketing to raise revenue
956308 i definitely try to pick it up when the camera is on
956309 sometimes we do have to make u turns sometimes we do have to park here and there
956310 this man wants to glorify himself and get some ratings
956311 its hard to say if we are achieving our goals
956312 we have been there too long and we are spending way too much money 348 billion a day its not a sustainable effort structured as it is so we need to make a major change and thats what this election is going to be about
956313 they have given unbelievable courage and bravery in the iraq freedom effort but i think it is now time for the iraqis to step up to the plate and find the courage they need
956314 its time for us to allow the iraqis to stand up on their own
956315 we are moving in a direction and we have been consistently where the objective of our military has been to provide an opportunity for the iraqis to have the breathing room they needed and to stand up on their own two feet
956316 not only are the casualties the lowest in history at only 11 last month but the withdrawal is being completed
956317 the casualties are at their lowest level and the troops are withdrawing so we are making great progress in iraq and in terms of the goals we established and that president bush outlined
956318 the goals going in were to search for and find any weapons of mass destruction depose sadaam hussein to allow the iraqis to have free elections and write a constitution and help them to build a military that could defend them
956319 we have accomplished all those except the latter and thats about done
956320 a new commission created by several small low income non oil producing nations was established to seek ways of forcing oil rich nations to share their oil revenue with poor nations
956321 senators declare war on offshore havens congressional scrutiny of the offshore vehicles used by companies investment funds and wealthy individuals is increasing a study by a separate senate panel last week calculated that offshore abuses cost the u s government 100 billion a year in lost tax revenue were going to find a way to make a huge dent in this problem said sen max baucus montana democrat and chairman of the senate finance committee
956322 simple people and have private conversations which are not listened to
956323 when youve been pitched headfirst into hell you just write about it
956324 we dont want the government shutdown to be an issue but the fact is the democrats are so overconfident that theyre willing to talk about a ban and theyre willing to talk about raising taxes on gasoline so this is just pretty incredible
956325 but i think that once americans realize that this drilling ban will expire unless we pass something i think there is going to be just an outcry to not vote for anything that had a ban in it
956326 if the democrats choose to hold the continuation of government operations as a hostage then as far as im concerned i cant vote for anything that has a ban in it
956327 that would just be a betrayal of everything were talking about as republicans and i think that most republicans are going to feel that way
956328 on october 1 the bans on offshore drilling and oil shale recovery will end enabling us to finally be able to develop more american energy unless democrats actively prohibit exploration
956329 i hope that speaker pelosi and democrats in the house and senate recognize the pain americans are feeling and will not actively enact legislation to block the development of american energy
956330 as far as im concerned on october 1 we should be able to begin the leasing process of drilling and mining in both of those areas of american energy supply
956331 but to begin again to prepare sanctions resolutions for the u n security council
956332 youve got three supply side worries pushing oil higher today iran the storm and nigeria
956333 much more open about their religion and make it part of their overall life
956334 today you even have leadership and management training workshops associated with muslims
956335 they are trying to climb the corporation into management whereas in the 1990s they were just happy to have a stable job
956336 as americans started losing confidence they stopped fearing their muslim neighbor
956337 the prayer rooms arent mandatory but they are fringe benefits
956338 if we had requests from muslim employees or nursing mothers as well as any prayer room for employees we would accommodate their requests
956339 pg amp e was also the first utility in the nation that sponsored a lesbian bisexual gay and transgender association in the 80s
956340 thrilled to partner with pg amp e to ensure that the laws of our state are not used to treat people unfairly
956341 as a heavily regulated monopoly in california pg amp e can make decisions such as this without regard to their customers or fear of boycott
956342 even in light of recent threats of protests and boycotts
956343 it is privatizing the gains and profits and socializing the losses as usual this is socialism for wall street and the rich
956344 in each one of these episodes the government bailed out the shareholders the bondholders and to some degree management
956345 when i look back on my college days maybe it was a different era in the late 60s but most of my fraternity brothers didnt have criminal records not yet most of them even those who were in rotc and hunters but the behaviors they exhibited werent the kind of behaviors that gave me confidence that packing guns in their lockers or in their rooms would make me safer
956346 allowing handguns does provide extra protection and extra deterrent against crime
956347 its not a one stop solution but provides a deterrent and i feel very comfortable with people who have fulfilled their requirement to be able to carry
956348 the media likes to paint us as paranoid about mass shootings on campus
956349 what we are more concerned about are the types of crimes that happen on a daily basis on our campuses across the country these crimes are rape assault robberies these are things we should be able to protect ourselves against
956350 rather than creating safe zones for victims we may unintentionally be creating safe zones for criminals who are doing the attacks and who have less to worry about
956351 i think its absolutely ludicrous and theres no need for it
956352 i dont think you can make the argument that if you had a gun on campus you could have stopped the virginia tech rampage i think it would make it worse
956353 if anyone brought a gun to class id be scared out of my mind regardless if they are trying to stop someone who is shooting someone or not
956354 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
956355 obviously he odinga believes that the votes were not tallied properly
956356 but what i urged was that all the leaders there regardless of their position on the election tell their supporters to stand down to desist with the violence and resolve it in a peaceful way with kenyan laws
956357 but i hope to get in touch with him some time soon i want to see if i can be helpful
956358 an unaccompanied disabled individual who has been continuously homeless for over one year
956359 who was he why was he so dirty why was he living on the street
956360 oh lord give us one more chance to give him that picture
956361 thats why they went home for the month theyre afraid of defections on this issue by their own members the pressure was rising day by day
956362 in an urgent memo sent to gop members and staff saturday a call to action on american energy republican leader john boehner and whip roy blunt hailed fridays action and encouraged house republicans to return to the capitol beginning monday morning to help keep the historic effort going
956363 there are things you can do individually though to save energy
956364 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
956365 i want to melt down their phones i want to flood their e mail boxes i want to hold them as political hostages the ransom demand is to unleash the free market to begin exploring and pumping domestic crude oil and getting it to market as fast as possible weve got two months days to make our voices heard lets make history by bringing this recalcitrant body of elitists into compliance with the will of the people and the rule of law
956366 but this time we wont just be stopping something bad from happening we will be doing something that is very good for the country something that will improve the lives of all of us something that will improve national security something vital for the future of the nation

956369 even established companies can find themselves at a disadvantage when it comes to hiring and managing the best talent in a region where they have limited history or experience this is one reason there is a fast growing demand for our services shashanks proven experience building software labs in europe and asia for fortune 1000 companies will be an invaluable asset as we expand this portion of our business to keep up with demand
956370 the next time youre in line at the grocery store and youre thinking you old geezer hurry up just think about how this felt
956371 we all started sharing experiences and realizing things that we perceived as discrimination
956372 they dont see a need we cant even get aarp
956373 they said that could be my mother or that could be my grandma
956374 i think that it is imperative that none of this be rushed
956375 tends to be a do it now kind of guy
956376 demand the time to think about all the what ifs
956377 a nata o brasileira j deixou a poca em que todos os nadadores n o passavam de 1 80 hoje nossos velocistas t m mais de 1 90 claro que ningu m tem a envergadura do michael gross que de bra os abertos tinha 2 06 m mas t m as caracter sticas que os principais velocistas hoje apresentam
956378 o p do thiago tem uma mobilidade muito grande no tornozelo o joelho tamb m tem um ngulo de flex o maior essas caracter sticas permitem que ele tenha pernada forte nos quatro estilos
956379 acho que o bi tipo ajuda mas n o determinante veja o rodriguinho por exemplo ele um dos melhores velocistas do pa s mesmo n o tendo bra os t o compridos quanto os dos outros velocistas
956380 o funil da nata o muito estreito e o da nata o feminina ainda menor
956381 a fab ola molina tem o corpo perfeito para o nado de costas alta e falando em tom de brincadeira faz menos sombra do que outros atletas
956382 m sculo por si s n o faz um nadador se fosse assim colocar amos um halterofilista na piscina e ele sairia nadando o que a nata o feminina brasileira precisa de um dolo para incentivar as meninas a nadar
956383 os maiores talentos n o nascem de acordo com o n vel social estamos perdendo muita coisa por a chegar ao topo do esporte s quando o brasil inteiro tiver a oportunidade de cair numa piscina e testar se tem aquele dom a mais s com a massifica o que voc descobre talentos excepcionais como michael phelps por exemplo
956384 eu tive muitos professores que me perguntavam se eu queria estudar ou nadar para mulheres muito mais dif cil porque n o temos dolos femininos quem est aqui no time ol mpico hoje est porque se inspirou nos meninos para aumentar o n vel da nata o precisamos de mulheres em quem as meninas posam se espelhar
956385 fora gua ningu m diz que sou velocista sou meio lerdinha mas isso me ajuda a me concentrar mais e os 50 m uma prova de precis o estar sempre focada e concentrada s ajuda
956386 desde pequena quando fazia os 100m minha volta era sempre muito pior do que a ida mesmo trabalhado de diversas maneiras nunca melhorei a ponto de igualar os dois al m disso a minha freq ncia de bra adas muito alta e sempre que treino muito n o perco a velocidade ao contr rio do que acontece com muita gente
956387 todos deveriam tentar o bungee uma vez mesmo que for para falar que n o quer mais fazer mas garanto quem pula sempre quer fazer de novo eu mesma j saltei duas vezes
956388 a gente agora tem conquistar pontos fora de casa de qualquer forma porque n o adianta em um campeonato de pontos corridos pontuar somente em casa ent o vamos enfrentar o santos em busca de uma vit ria fora de casa para podermos embalar na competi o
956389 a gente sabe que a partir do momento que conseguir uma vit ria fora de casa o torcedor vai voltar ao campo hora boa da gente buscar os tr s pontos contra o santos sabemos que vai ser uma partida dif cil respeitando a equipe do santos independentemente da situa o deles e quem sabe a gente n o busca uma vit ria para trazer o torcedor de volta para o mineir o
956390 muita aten o determina o saber que no futebol hoje tem de se marcar forte quando est sem a bola com um n mero maior de atletas atr s da linha da bola
956391 temos de eliminar a desaten o que vem acontecendo nos ltimos jogos evitar os gols no inicio de partida vamos criar uma estrat gia boa para jogar fora afinal voc n o pode ir jogar fora e ir para cima do advers rio t o afoitamente como vinha acontecendo
956392 entrar no g 4 era quest o de tempo uma hora a gente iria chegar mas o nosso pensamento agora est no gr mio antes era o flamengo se o gr mio ganhou a gente tem que ganhar n o podemos errar mais porque erramos muito no come o quando a nossa prioridade era outra a libertadores tanto que o gr mio ganhou da gente
956393 isso aqui esporte n o tem nada de vingan a o fluminense ganhou da gente com um gol legal mereceram ganhar eles nos trataram muito bem l o ruim quando n o te tratam bem mas isso n o existe mais no futebol seja no rio de janeiro em minas gerais na argentina em qualquer lugar vai ser outro jogo com outro foco
956394 quem quer ser campe o tem que ganhar fora de casa a gente tem que respeitar o fluminense que vive uma situa o complicada mas tem uma excelente equipe com excelentes jogadores e essa fase passageira
956395 ele sente dor mas dor de trauma da pancada fizemos um exame de resson ncia e teremos o resultado amanh ter a ser o dia d para saber se o thiago poder jogar
956396 o m rito dos jogadores pela dedica o empenho tivemos dificuldades contra os quatro principalmente no mineir o j que botafogo e vasco estiveram bem fechados
956397 o flamengo a gente sabe que um time bem organizado bem posicionado competitivo e que criou dificuldades
956398 vamos trabalhar para dar seq ncia aos nossos objetivos l na frente

956402 i am disappointed and it was a surprise because this is a player who has played in the champions league and been in the argentina squad for the olympic games
956403 you have managers talking about how good he is so i think the system needs to change
956404 now we have to look for a solution maybe find a team for him on loan but we have maybe eight or 10 teams in spain italy and greece asking about him
956405 when you have eight or 10 teams asking about a player and hes not playing it means that he is good
956406 he has a long contract and i think he can impress and next year will be a different situation

956412 the chaos precipitated by the killing poses dangers beyond pakistans immediate neighborhood said jack rosen a past president of the american jewish congress noting that pakistan is one of a handful of declared nuclear powers and the only muslim country with the bomb if the government fell into extremist hands the bomb also falls into the hands of extremists rosen told jta you dont need to worry about a nuclear iran you have a nuclear pakistan in the hands of extremists
956413 she wrote me of how she admired israel and of her desire to see a normalization in the relations between israel and pakistan including the establishment of diplomatic ties
956414 according to a report in israels daily maariv bhutto reached out to the mossad among other security agencies for protection ron kampeas bhutto assassination sets off alarms over pakistans nukes san francisco sentinel december 28 2007
956415 the hebrew daily newspaper maariv further revealed that bhutto had asked israels mossad spy agency along with the cia and britains scotland yard to help protect her in the run up to pakistans january 8 election
956416 in a move that may endear her to western supporters and moderates in her country but which is also sure to be exploited by islamist opponents the top contender for pakistans premiership benazir bhutto conducted a private meeting this week with israels ambassador to the united nations dan gillerman
956417 a three hour dinner at the mandarin oriental hotel in midtown was attended by the exiled former prime minister of pakistan the israeli ambassador and a few associates
956418 prior to her return from exile in october bhutto 54 had been reaching out to israel as part of a broader strategy of garnering western support for her confrontation with the military regime led by musharraf
956419 the ex shah of iran and mobutu were both of the view that the road to power in washington lies through the israel lobby it isnt entirely surprising then that benazir should have tried to grease her way back into power with friendly overtures to the apartheid regime over jerusalem that will perhaps also explain why the quickest to mourn her departure were the us congresss inhouse ogre tom lantos and the lobbys other water boy arlen specter
956420 for jews and pakistanis in america the assassination presents an opportunity for dialogue said rabbi marc schneier president of the foundation for ethnic understanding
956421 coincidentally schneier said a meeting between american jewish communal leaders and pakistani officials had been set just prior to the assassination
956422 it came to me that this woman loves and worships the same god i do
956423 i had this sharpened awareness that in that moment she was in touch with god just as i was it was a dawning and an awakening and it was liberating because it liberates you from standing on a pedestal and looking down on someone else
956424 beyond 9 11 christians and muslims together a new world vision
956425 is that we can find a way to bridge the chasm between christians muslims jews hindus and buddhists and make atlanta a model city that over the next year or two we can develop an interfaith immersion program
956426 a soft evangelical i ask questions and listen rather than telling people what they ought to do or believe
956427 im the most unlikely candidate for becoming a spokesperson about islam
956428 i wondered who i was now that i wasnt a teacher preacher traveler or speaker
956429 you get beneath the dogma and creeds to the essence of what religion is about its about god in human beings in human consciousness
956430 a voice in my head said and you dont know anything about islam which was true i have five degrees four of them theological and other religions had never been taught seriously to me
956431 everything about my faith is rooted in the stories my two grandmothers told me
956432 no one formally taught me to pray as a child i had the question what is god like my grandmother answered that is like a drop in the ocean trying to understand what the ocean is like this is something i feel with my heart god is present in everything god is all around us
956433 there were a couple of imams muslim clerics and im thinking they know all this stuff and im stumbling around in it
956434 we had a pastor and an imam describe how they came to the faith that gives their lives meaning
956435 and we asked people to talk at their tables about how their faith came to them
956436 i dont think just knowledge about another faith is any good
956437 youve gotta meet someone who is of the faith who is speaking out of conviction and out of experience to really feel what islam is like
956438 puts muslims at ease because hes mastered the broad historical perspective of islam but also some of the nuanced details
956439 people are more open to learning a new perspective from someone they respect ben is not trying to convert anyone but to inform people and build understanding
956440 when i heard him talk about islam i thought we need him
956441 many christians are fearful of islam so they put up barriers they trust ben so they are willing to take the first step and listen for understanding
956442 if you sit in silence you can get deep enough into your faith that it touches another person
956443 the reality is that at the core were all the same
956444 in my 76th year i would be passionate about getting christians jews muslims and hindus together nothing in my history would point me in this direction this is not my dream i think its the spirit of god
956445 i remember sitting here in 2005 after winning the june race and this track is real gratifying to win here a lot of great drivers have done very well here and it just means a lot to be on the list of people who have won here
956446 osborne did a great job i wasnt so sure about halfway through when were yelling at each other but bob did an unbelievable job
956447 the rain comes and were not sure what we wanted to do
956448 it was a stressful day but it worked out for us we both had a good time doing it and thats why were here to win and have a good time
956449 i love road courses theyre a lot of fun weve historically had pretty good luck at both sonoma and watkins glen were leaving here with a smile on our face and looking forward to next weekend
956450 scares a lot of people when i streak through my neighborhood
956451 thats where a lot of the big foot sightings have come from in the past eight years
956452 we were in a window right to make one more stop and it worked out really good at the end
956453 we dont give up i can promise you that we stick in there and fight even when they tell us were done
956454 to come to pocono and finish in the top five is a huge accomplishment for me at the beginning there i was just up underneath somebody and think the no 78 just got in the back there we all kind of got jammed up i dont think it was anybodys fault but it worked out good we were able to work on our car and just kept making it better all day
956455 i hate it for these guys but i told them to be proud of what we did do dont be disappointed about what we didnt do we did some great things today i am proud i appreciate them letting me drive the car
956456 i used to take a normal aerobics class but it was boring and monotonous
956457 so i tried out pole dancing its a really social activity ive met a lot of girls here who im now close friends with and i like that it makes me feel sexy
956458 im not good at science like my parents im the black sheep of my family in that sense
956459 i wandered into a pub and there was a woman dancing on the stage
956460 people here have never seen a pole dance and for that reason they dont associate it with stripping or women of ill repute
956461 i knew if i could give people a positive first impression of this as a clean fun social activity people wouldnt just accept it theyd embrace it
956462 most of the people in the audience had no idea what this was
956463 i think this is just a fad and i dont think its appropriate for women
956464 ive been contacted by many people who dont like what were doing

956477 todays hackers are targeting unsuspecting pc users by silently infecting computers to send spam perform web attacks and carry out other crimes
956478 infected computers often show no symptoms of infection making it difficult to know youve got a problem anti malware solutions need to be innovative and need to be catching new threats
956479 the number of viruses and malware out there is growing at an alarming rate and the idea of tracking them by signature based solutions alone continues to be absurd
956480 novashields behavior tracking software maps high and low level events at the kernel in order to block new threats and thereby fills a widening gap left by traditional av or whitelisting products for the average home pc user and small business
956481 pc security experts have been talking about the problems with traditional anti virus technologies for years
956482 our approach is well designed to supplement the protection afforded by current signature scanning anti virus programs while preventing emerging threats from taking root and stealing private information such as social security numbers passwords and credit card transactions

956501 the operator can be running tests with only five minutes of training in standalone mode this is ideal for quality control purposes in busy food production environments
956502 the 1 000 gram load cell can handle yogurts while the 4 500 gram load cell would be appropriate for crackers and the 10kg unit for hard rolls or loaves of crusty bread
956503 the operator places the food item on the instrument base table and the appropriate probe is selected in the case of the crackers it could be a three point bend assembly while in the case of the bread it could be a cylindrical probe
956504 there is a dual grip assembly that can be used to take a piece of packaging material and pull it apart this allows the operator to measure how easy or difficult it is for example to open a sealed package of snack mix
956505 we have placed a big bet that plastic electronics is indeed a game changing technology
956506 over time the markets and possibilities for plastic electronics are endless
956507 we are approaching very significant milestones in the creation of the plastic electronics industry with the opening of our dresden plant and the pending launch of our first commercial consumer electronics product
956508 this new investment will enable expanded business operations in support of our first commercial product early next year while we continue to develop our ip to deliver on our broader long term vision

956528 ameresco plans to capture some of that unused biogas and transport it to the anheuser busch brewery through a six mile underground pipeline
956529 the solar energy system will generate the equivalent of approximately three per cent of the brewerys electricity needs and also generate renewable energy certificates recs for businesses or individuals to purchase to offset fossil fuel use and emissions

956531 water use in particular is a major threat especially for brewers in dry regions who are more reliant on a sustainable supply of the resource

956547 they were then picked up by army helicopter from base camp this morning and have now been shifted to hospital for treatment for severe frostbite
956548 our four high altitude porters left a while ago and it is expected that they will bring the italian climber down this evening
956549 badly affected and it appears that at least one of them would have his hand and leg chopped off this is what our high altitude doctors believe

956621 a guide on how freelancers can compete against large design studios
956622 designing is not a profession but an attitude design has many connotations it is the organization of materials and processes in the most productive way in a harmonious balance of all elements necessary for a certain function it is the integration of technological social and economical requirements biological necessities and the psychological effects of materials shape color volume and space thinking in relationships
956623 i think ben and anthony take it too far in suggesting that a single minded point of view is necessary for design
956624 always consider a design in relation to its next larger context
956625 its an extremely important position and one that can catapult a person into higher office
956626 except for the case of the d a mike nifong who prosecuted the duke lacrosse players its almost impossible to screw up as a prosecutor

956631 doctors are duty bound if they see one of their colleagues doing something untoward to report it mr robertson said
956632 what has happened in this case is that over a two year period between 2004 and 2006 this individual has been allowed on occasion to operate without appropriate supervision mr robertson said
956633 that was a result of a breakdown of communication between the college of surgeons the medical board and indeed queensland health
956634 what this report suggests is that a critical lack of communication between industry and government agencies is putting patients lives at risk mr langbroek said in a statement
956635 the fact that a doctor with serious question marks over his head as to his clinical capability was allowed to operate without any supervision is beyond belief in this post patel era

956687 it was the start of a sexual assault there were three of us and youd think thered have been safety in numbers but we were so frightened of him wed have done anything
956688 he made us stand on a wall said stay there and went looking for somewhere to take us
956689 then he came back and tried to get us into the house he was desperate and really agitated
956690 we managed to attract the attention of some people at a bus stop and ran away i thank god those people were there because we were so scared

956697 i am extremely pleased that bill stephan has agreed to lead this important search
956698 bills longstanding commitment to excellence at indiana university and the strong personal and professional relationships he has cultivated across the state make him the ideal person to chair this committee
956699 bill will be working with a group of distinguished individuals all of whom care very deeply about the university i am confident that under his leadership we will find a director who has the experience necessary to lead our athletic department into the future and who will embrace the tradition and values of the university
956700 i look forward to working with president mcrobbie our very accomplished committee and our many friends and supporters of iu all of whom are committed to bringing forth exceptional candidates
956701 we have implemented several successful initiatives over the past 18 months in an effort to size our business to match declining market demand however market conditions have continued to deteriorate and we do not see significant improvements occurring in the near future therefore the company finds it necessary to take further action by implementing a significant capacity reduction
956702 we deeply regret the impact that shutting down these operations will have on our employees and their families as well as the communities in which they live and work
956703 we feel this action while painful will enable us to continue to provide world class products and best in the industry customer care
956704 both the coburg and warsaw manufacturing facilities have experience building these types of models
956705 over the last several quarters in order to align production with retail demand we have reduced production by taking days and weeks off the closure of these production facilities in indiana will decrease our class a motorized capacity from approximately 180 units per week to 90 and should allow the company to begin working full time at the remaining plants in the fourth quarter the new manufacturing footprint should also allow us to reduce the need for discounting at lower sales volumes
956706 this change will also reduce our working capital requirements and borrowing requirements significantly
956707 additionally we will continue to adjust other areas in our business to reduce our break even level

956716 it appears that the property may not be sufficient to discharge the mortgaged debt
956717 the clear language of section 362 a 1 thus extends the automatic stay provision only to the debtor filing bankruptcy proceedings and not to non bankrupt co defendants
956718 unambiguously states that the stay operates only as against the debtor
956719 the separate legal existence of a corporation is respected in bankruptcy the automatic stay does not stay actions against separate entities associated with the debtor
956720 none of the llcs referred to are parties to the bankruptcy they are not proper parties and not protected by the provisions of the automatic stay
956721 irmscher did not file an answer to capital crossings amended complaint and therefore admitted at the very least to the superiority of capital crossings mortgage
956722 in this case although irmschers counsel entered an appearance irmscher failed to file an answer asserting whatever interest it had in the property as such we conclude that the trial court did not err in finding that irmscher had no interest in the property
956723 the purpose of a fraudulent transfer claim is the removal of obstacles which prevent the enforcement of the judgment and if successful will subject the transferred property to execution
956724 the plaintiffs success under a fraudulent transfer theory depends upon whether the trustees transfers to her parents were made 1 for a bona fide and honest debt 2 in good faith and 3 free of fraudulent intent
956725 the existence of several of these badges may warrant an inference of fraudulent intent but no particular badge constitutes fraudulent intent per se
956726 you dont see any exposure to our bank under the lender liability act do you
956727 surely the borrower wont countersue us under indianas lender liability statute
956728 a borrower may assert a claim arising from a loan document only if the loan document 1 is in writing 2 sets forth all material terms and conditions of the loan document and 3 is signed by the lender and the borrower
956729 no suit or action shall be maintained on certain classes of contracts or engagements unless there shall be a note or memorandum thereof in writing signed by the party to be charged
956730 you cannot predict the future you must create the future

956732 new york courts have a proud history of interpreting the new york constitution as providing greater protections for individual rights than the federal constitution this case presents an opportunity to continue that tradition by declaring that the new york constitution prohibits the government from seizing private homes simply to turn them over to a developer who covets them for a massive luxury condominium project
956733 we are confident that the court will see this for what it is government officials bending to the will of bruce ratner allowing him to wield the power of eminent domain for his personal financial benefit
956734 occupancy of any such project shall be restricted to persons of low income as defined by law and preference shall be given to persons who live or shall have lived in such area or areas
956735 persons who live or shall have lived in such area
956736 never go to the foot when the head can be had
956737 free software and the process we are learning from communities is changing the professional practice of software development
956738 i think free software is going to have a profound impact on the practice of software development in a community setting
956739 lessons learned in classic production environments can be applied to software development like from the auto industry
956740 when you look at open source software its amazing how much waste there is
956741 in the free software community the most productive people are not the specialists its the ones who know a little bit about everything
956742 decide late freaks me out but it works you do a little bit and deliver it you have smaller chunks of work moving fast through the system
956743 see the whole cultivate a shared result it is not done until its completely done this leads you to avoid handoffs which is good because handoffs are one of the ways that things tend to pile up
956744 look at the agile world for some of the key values but in the community environment maybe we can go beyond that
956745 we value knowledge and interest over co location or sitting together
956746 we value continuous integration over continuous iteration that fits nicely into the free software world where you dont know whats coming in from the community
956747 we want it for every build not just every release
956748 we need to go from release early and often to this cycle we added x every month we roll out new code and beta users get code every day
956749 must keep the trunk pristine keep releases flowing and release on demand
956750 if any code fails the pre commit test the commit cant happen
956751 if you have pre commit testing you cant argue its a way to make sure the trunk is always releasable
956752 the agile impact report proven performance metrics from the agile enterprise
956753 current market data on the agile industry often falls short of examining the true impact that agile practices have on teams throughout the entire lifecycle
956754 we wanted to go beyond adoption rates or estimating project improvements and provide software organizations with proven metrics supported by actual project examples that accurately demonstrate how agile development projects measure up against plan based or waterfall projects
956755 the album is completely done all that remains to do is all up to the company to complete such as booklet promotion and stuff like that we are extremely happy with the result jonas has made our sound even heavier than before and our songwriting is also taken to the next level its brutal melodic and a big fuckin punch in your face so we really hope that you will dig this new album as much as we do and dont forget to come see us on the unleashed krisiun army tour beginning on 14th of november

956770 if you cant be in washington we ask that you contribute to the cause in other ways such as spreading the word among your constituents writing an op ed for your local newspaper or taking our all of the above energy message to your local airwaves
956771 republicans stand with the american people we share their passion and determination for energy independence and weve pledged to fight boldly until congress heeds their will

956839 lo mismo que la c pula etarra traslada a los integrantes de sus comandos operativos y la misma con la que acaban todos los discursos de los dirigentes etarras en los juicios que se celebran en la audiencia nacional

956842 two dutch climbers were brought by our people and their colleagues down to base camp from an altitude of 7 300 metres overnight
956843 they were then picked up by army helicopter from base camp this morning and have now been shifted to hospital for treatment for severe frostbite
956844 our four high altitude porters left a while ago and it is expected that they will bring the italian climber down this evening
956845 badly affected and it appears that at least one of them would have his hand and leg chopped off this is what our high altitude doctors believe
956846 at least 11 climbers have died this is one of the worst incidents in the history of k2 climbing
956847 every expedition has lost at least one or two people
956848 i have carried down both living and dead people from the mountain
956849 i was terrified that the pakistani would pull us all off the cliff and screamed to him to use his ice axe but he lost his grip and plummeted off a 300 metre cliff
956850 we had a feeling this would not turn out well and decided to turn around the accident could have been prevented these mountains lure out way too inexperienced and naive people
956851 unlike the often impulsive incumbent buyukanit basbug is known for his cool and calculating nature
956852 the result will be less likelihood of abrupt escalations in civil military tension but at the same time more effective political pressure from the military
956853 basbug is regarded as one of the most outstanding officers of his generation combining a strong intellect with a deep commitment to turkish secularism basbug who will occupy the post for the next two years is likely to prove a formidable opponent for the akp

956859 the board of imperial confirms that it has received another approach in relation to a possible cash offer for the company
956860 there can be no certainty that any offer will ultimately be made for the company or as to the terms on which any such offer might be made
956861 i said well the in part is easy thats like taking a 100 pound sack of potatoes and just throwing them in the seat you just throw yourself into it
956862 i said the getting out part is a little harder
956863 i think its about time they did something to recognize her
956864 theres just not enough words to describe what she does for this place
956865 i said next time we meet bring a friend not necessarily from the church but as long as theyre 60 or more
956866 and we grew and grew at that time there were very few seniors groups at all in the city or the suburbs
956867 i thought they should make a senior center when they were doing it and they did when it was built it was supposed to be the senior center and as the years went by the powers that be started calling it the community center but it was always ours first
956868 shes really taken the program and gotten it going shes just done a tremendous amount for the residents and the seniors of the village and we just wanted to show our appreciation
956869 theyve always got something going on if you dont have anything to do for the day you can always come down and find something to do if it wasnt for jean we probably wouldnt be here she keeps it going and makes sure everybodys got somebody
956870 its corny but its brought a lot of happiness to a lot of people
956871 we were very fortunate to find a place out here
956872 at the same time many cash strapped americans are increasingly frustrated by higher ticket prices baggage fees airport delays and canceled flights that they are simply forgoing vacations that require air travel and staying closer to home

956877 it takes time and privacy especially working out the methods which i wouldnt have guessed anyone really knew in the lab at that time
956878 the changes really began to accelerate in the last year he would sit at his desk weeping
956879 he really couldnt do his work any more the pressure was tremendous
956880 people given these kinds of responsibilities with this kind of power at their fingertips we have to make sure that they are not likely to do harm to others or misuse that authority be it intentionally or be it because of some mental problem
956881 these kinds of situations cry out for reexamination of our standards
956882 youre basically going to scare off any scientist from wanting to work in this field if it becomes even more stringent
956883 it is a balance its a policy decision about how stringent we want to be
956884 for many of our mountain commuters it is the only form of transportation that these people have
956885 everything that we do is being undermined by the fuel crisis
956886 you would put a lot of people out of work if you took their bus away from them
956887 the key is to know how and what resources to utilize to gather the best information
956888 new users should know that there is a great community of linux users that are willingly dedicated to helping people with technical problems for absolutely nothing and those resources are available in a few different ways forums irc chat rooms mailing lists local linux user groups and a plethora of web sites dedicated to providing the community with linux how tos
956889 if i had to write a linux starters kit it would be along these lines
956890 windows users switching to linux need to understand packages and repositories
956891 repositories whether yum are the killer app for linux they provide the greatest single advantage over windows from an end user perspective
956892 but in reality installing linux software especially if its in your repositories is one of the easiest things you can do
956893 i recently read comments about someone who gave up on linux because they couldnt install family tree maker when a perfectly good alternative gramps was only an apt get away
956894 customization new linux users should be encouraged to customize their desktop
956895 not only will this show off the power of xfce compared to windows but it will get the user accustomed to the idea that they can and should make changes to their computer to make it look and feel and act the way they want it to every time i see a default ubuntu desktop i see a failure to teach someone about linux
956896 windows users are afraid of the command line and rightfully so its a scary place in windows if they think that they need the command line in linux then linux will scare them
956897 i think they should be exposed to the terminal told what the command line equivalent is of any gui action a gui focused how to or help guide tells them to do and again encourage them to play around in it
956898 making software free is what makes it work for them so it is important that they understand it
956899 once the users understand the philosophy of open source they can understand the open source community and why support forums are often better than an 800 number
956900 i think by far the easiest way to learn linux is to get together with others who know how to use linux
956901 after the user is started its much easier to use help pages to get the rest of the way
956902 seriously if one is technical and wants to learn linux i recommend buying one of many linux magazines they almost always have some distro cd with them in the stores then find an old machine around the house and install linux
956903 i tend to favor the oreilly books consider starting with linux in a nutshell
956904 start in the etc directory look at files ending in conf cfg rc look in the directory etc rc d init look at the startup scripts look in sbin and do man xxx on commands found there those are sysadmin commands youll learn about how to manage the system also look in usr sbin for some less pedantic admin commands
956905 start ls ing in bin usr bin and usr local bin do man xxx on anything that piques your curiosity
956906 if by now your curiosity isnt piqued stop youre not interested in linux
956907 if this got you started i apologize in advance for taking up the next few years of your life
956908 the first thing you need when learning linux is a solution
956909 for me windows was bloated and the switch to linux served a purpose
956910 id say the best way for a new user to get familiar with linux is to play with or install if a hard drives free one of the many excellent live cds available
956911 you no longer need to understand your system to pick which distro would work the best since just about every distro works the same todays installers will not only set up a working system but actually migrate your settings from your former operating system so that you dont really even need to configure it
956912 back in the day obtaining ice cream was a bit harder
956913 you made a decision on what flavor you wanted gathered the ingredients for that flavor made the ice cream and picked how you wanted to serve it
956914 imagine being dressed properly and comfy wherever and whenever the brand nat 2 makes it possible by using its two in one system all tops are interchangeable which allows one to combine colours materials and styles by taking one base and various tops you can save weight and gain more space while travelling the world
956915 the nation will have to decide as to which kind of islam it wants the world says that pakistan is extremist we will have to prove that we are not so when i say this im dubbed as an american stooge we have to decide whether we want a liberal and moderate pakistan or a terrorist or extremist pakistan
956916 this sting operation proves that there are gaps in the system and that scam artists can exploit and are exploiting those gaps
956917 if real fraudsters had been in charge of the fictitious companies they would have been clear to bill medicare from the virginia office for potentially millions of dollars worth of nonexistent supplies
956918 will only be successful if those tasked with ensuring compliance exercise due diligence when conducting screenings and inspections
956919 we have two but a lot of times we dont have enough people to run them
956920 in some communities out there its the volunteer fire department or nothing
956921 theres not the economic base to support a career department so if they cant keep the volunteer fire department viable then the potential exists that theyre not going to have any protection at all
956922 your mom and your dad was in the fire service and their parents were in the fire service and it just goes on from generation to generation
956923 it makes you wonder where well be 20 years from now
956924 every time i hear the pager go off you know you wonder whos gonna be there and whos not
956925 sometimes you just dont have anybody to go especially during the day
956926 i hate to admit it but theres been more times this year where other departments have had to help us out
956927 we pat them on the back as hard as we can
956928 parents have to navigate a minefield of calories fat and salt to find them
956929 parents want to feed their children healthy meals but americas chain restaurants are setting parents up to fail
956930 mcdonalds burger king kfc and other chains are conditioning kids to expect burgers fried chicken pizza french fries macaroni and cheese and soda in various combination at almost every lunch and dinner
956931 proud to offer a variety of kids meals for those looking for lower calorie lower fat options
956932 since the financial crisis erupted last august theres been a flood of investment into gold really because of its safe haven properties
956933 gold is no ones liability and that means it is the ultimate defence against unforeseen contingencies
956934 people were very worried when they saw the northern rock situation
956935 and i think people are starting to realise that when the bank has your money they might not actually physically have it if theres a problem
956936 buying gold is an important part of the culture and lifestyle
956937 its proven to be one of the best things that you ever buy it lasts for years
956938 theyre not finding it as easy as they used to
956939 to suddenly announce that you are going to sell a significant amount of it at auctions when the market was in a pretty fragile state was to totally destroy or potentially to destroy the gold price
956940 the 17 gold auctions netted the exchequer around 3 5bn
956941 now the proceeds were well invested in government bonds the value approximately doubled to around 7bn
956942 had gordon brown decided not to sell the gold and sold at the peak earlier this year the exchequer would be better off to the tune of around t 3bn
956943 was part of a restructuring of the foreign currency and gold reserves aimed at achieving a better balanced portfolio
956944 the national audit office in a report in 2002 concluded that the treasury had met its objectives selling in a transparent and fair manner while achieving value of money it added that other central banks around the world have adopted similar policies
956945 the idea of using a waste product to make oil and i like the idea of being energy independent but it also saves a lot of money
956946 when it comes down to it you can put food in someones stomach or you can put fuel in the tank of the car and its that kind of black and white
956947 its a disaster to see the rainforests being cleared whole sale and massive monoculture palm oil plantations put in their place
956948 it wont be possible in the beginning to trace everything but that doesnt mean to say that we shouldnt do all that we can
956949 you have to look at all the consumers of palm oil and not just biofuels
956950 concerned that the adoption of biofuels so enthusiastically means were running ahead of the science

957126 perhaps a product like this might help people who have a hard time initiating an exercise program

957272 el avance de un proceso en condiciones tales que afectar a fatalmente las garant as constitucionales vinculadas con las formas del enjuiciamiento criminal por lo que a mi criterio resultar a tard o atender esos agravios en ocasi n del fallo final de la causa ya que aunque la sentencia fuese absolutoria el perjuicio que el apelante hubiera querido evitar ya se habr a soportado

957281 las familias de campo sufren cada d a m s intentos de desalojos detenciones y criminalizaci n con o sin retenciones la represi n seguir las fumigaciones que nos envenenan estar n a la orden del d a y seguiremos en la lucha porque no hay ninguna intenci n de desarmar el modelo de agronegocios ni distribuci n de tierras ni cuestionamientos al actual uso de la tierra la discusi n es entre empresarios del campo y politiqueros de doble discurso
957282 se trata de un conflicto por dinero y poder ni siquiera hay una discusi n ideol gica todos ellos entienden la tierra como una mercanc a y pelean por ver qui n se queda con la mayor parte las cuatro entidades son totalmente opuestas a nuestra ideolog a con un trasfondo hist rico que a n no est saldado donde hubo usurpaci n y desaparici n de una gran parte de nuestro pueblo no nos olvidamos de ese crimen

957295 the scheme has a lot of potential but owing to shortages of inputs and capital it has not been performing to expectations
957296 as a result we decided to resource the scheme through availing of tractors disc ploughs and harrows for tillage
957297 to enhance the capacity of the farmers we sought help from exhort enterprises to adopt the scheme and monitor production here
957298 we are also bringing expertise which will see our agronomists monitoring the production line so that the produce meets the required export quality we expect the first crop which will cover more than 40 hectares to be planted by the end of this week
957299 under the deal the scheme would move from the haphazard cropping to proper management supply of inputs and most importantly information on the lucrative export market
957300 please have mercy on me my sons this is the only goat left in my pen the other two were taken during the elections to feed your counterparts
957301 we thought this time we would rest from all the problems brought by the elections since they are over but we are shocked to see the very same youths following us again and forcing us to donate our precious livestock in this time of hunger
957302 our supporters are still being harassed and recently we received reports that they are being forced to donate their livestock and cash for the celebrations
957303 we are not happy at all with this and we think this must come to an end especially at this time when our parties are currently in talks to try to find a solution to the political crisis bedevilling our nation
957304 i lost two beasts during the elections this time they took my goats and the main reason for this is that i was a strong opposition activist during the march harmonised elections we thought harassment was over since they won the previous elections but they are still on us
957305 it is very dangerous to refuse because we witnessed horrendous incidents of beatings torture and murders during the election run off
957306 so we would rather lose our livestock than our lives those guys are brutal and ruthless we saw it for ourselves
957307 since the financial crisis erupted last august theres been a flood of investment into gold really because of its safe haven properties
957308 gold is no ones liability and that means it is the ultimate defence against unforeseen contingencies
957309 people were very worried when they saw the northern rock situation
957310 and i think people are starting to realise that when the bank has your money they might not actually physically have it if theres a problem
957311 buying gold is an important part of the culture and lifestyle
957312 its proven to be one of the best things that you ever buy it lasts for years
957313 theyre not finding it as easy as they used to
957314 to suddenly announce that you are going to sell a significant amount of it at auctions when the market was in a pretty fragile state was to totally destroy or potentially to destroy the gold price
957315 the 17 gold auctions netted the exchequer around 3 5bn
957316 now the proceeds were well invested in government bonds the value approximately doubled to around 7bn
957317 had gordon brown decided not to sell the gold and sold at the peak earlier this year the exchequer would be better off to the tune of around t 3bn
957318 was part of a restructuring of the foreign currency and gold reserves aimed at achieving a better balanced portfolio
957319 the national audit office in a report in 2002 concluded that the treasury had met its objectives selling in a transparent and fair manner while achieving value of money it added that other central banks around the world have adopted similar policies
957320 as these foreign powers grow in wealth and influence the danger is that a country which is as open as britain to foreign investment eventually just becomes the kind of plaything for the political whims of foreign powers
957321 dubai buying liverpool may not be much of an issue but when it comes to a utility or a major bank it could well be
957322 i think theyve proven themselves to be a stabilizing influence in the world
957323 theyve put to work billions of dollars to stabilise the banking system in europe and specifically in the us
957324 theyre frequently run either directly by government officials or by government cronies so although we have not yet seen any cases of outright abuse its quite possible that well get them and in fact i think it is extremely likely over the next five to 10 years
957325 if we come to the crunch about issues like taiwan tibet things where we are strategic competitors in a way and we dont agree does that mean we are going to be very muted in our response that were going to be obliged to react less strongly than we did before
957326 they are going to be very big players and that shouldnt worry us
957327 would we prefer the countries of the gulf to be earning all that money and burying it in the sand would we prefer the chinese to be simply hoarding the money or bailing out our banks and investing it in potentially profitable investment opportunities in the uk or germany or france or america
957328 by 2012 sovereign wealth funds will have about 7 trillion to invest worldwide
957329 the idea of using a waste product to make oil and i like the idea of being energy independent but it also saves a lot of money
957330 when it comes down to it you can put food in someones stomach or you can put fuel in the tank of the car and its that kind of black and white
957331 its a disaster to see the rainforests being cleared whole sale and massive monoculture palm oil plantations put in their place
957332 it wont be possible in the beginning to trace everything but that doesnt mean to say that we shouldnt do all that we can
957333 you have to look at all the consumers of palm oil and not just biofuels
957334 concerned that the adoption of biofuels so enthusiastically means were running ahead of the science
957335 it is trying to fill in the gaps with other disciplines like chemists physicists biologists and engineers but with this approach there is only so much you can do
957336 fairly sharp decline over the last five to ten years
957337 food science profession is on the wrong path in north america
957338 food scientists are not chefs food science is a scientific discipline
957339 so we are actually at number one and three on the cool list
957340 we have a decline in the number of food science students and practicing food scientists
957341 we want to show high school students that food science is a flexible interesting real world science and you get a very rewarding career
957342 we put students to task to bring others into the association
957343 the decline has stopped and were probably now starting to go back up
957344 i dont want to jump the gun and say weve turned the corner but im very hopeful that well see a reversal of the tide we now have to sustain these programs
957345 but industry has been slightly slower to react to the decline
957346 recently there have been a series of books and activity giving food science a pretty bad reputation
957347 it is sad to see smart articulate educated people writing these things but the bottom line is without food science we will not be able to feed the seven billion or so people on this planet
957348 alright with the way things have been going lately this too shall pass and i might even experience a wonderful outcome
957349 food for thought cultivating the attitude of gratitude does what for you
957350 possibilities in grassroots activism a topic with which you will learn he is intimately involved
957351 the conferees have combined elements from both bills to require institutions to advise students about this issue and to certify that all institutions have plans to combat and reduce illegal peer to peer file sharing
957352 the outbreak took place hundreds of kilometres away and thus the illegal farmers must still adhere to the deadline
957353 youre an animator youre supposed to want to watch all animated films
957354 one farmer may not sound as much but if you are told that seven percent of the producers are leaving with a further 14 percent planning to do the same this may paint a different picture
957355 we believe they will also have a shortage again because of the decrease in producer prices
957356 unfortunately milk has not been targeted as one of the products that are free of vat

957359 james would give us the versatility that paul green used to give us negotiations are continuing
957360 we are still a relatively small chain and are able to monitor consumer reviews on the main sites directly but as we expand we will probably have to review this all our hotels monitor their consumer reviews and the general managers are required to reply to all negative comments if the site allows it we also encourage them to subscribe to google alerts and monitor what consumers are writing on blogs reputation management is now just as important as brand management with google universal search becoming more widespread it will be imperative for hotels not only to monitor consumer reviews which for example are already being displayed on google local business listings but also to participate and start posting images and videos online about their property and destination
957361 the certification heralds the advent of a new era in living standards
957362 it is the first of its kind for a residential colony in india
957363 the first phase being successful our second phase would include more ambitious plans as the residents have become mature we would include more colonies and as and when we feel that a certain colony has attained the requisite standards we will help them apply for certification
957364 by getting this certification we have made a statement to the world that the colony residents are not only environment conscious and friendly but wanted to achieve high standards in hygienic living
957365 we will do our best not to falter in any audit by complying with all the regulations
957366 i want to make winona county a place that is turbine friendly and environmentally friendly
957367 if the windfarm does eventually get built we will certainly be looking for a block council tax reduction
957368 this convention will be the greenest most sustainable most successful political convention in history
957369 the green delegate challenge is a critical part of that effort
957370 weve been credited in a number of studies for being transparent with everything except for financials
957371 we typically bid against many of our competitors so disclosing our financials doesnt make sense
957372 these are folks who would not risk their reputations by working with any carbon offset provider that wasnt the best in class
957373 because they would be under the microscope and thats why were working with the dnc
957374 nobody likes to be misled the green dnc convention is an absolute sham
957375 but its sitting up there on the hill and its just a work in progress
957376 i told nativeenergy and the dnc it was not running
957377 i think their whole deal was well it will be running
957378 it is not uncommon for the media to take pot shots at the nansy pansy liberalism that embraces all things green
957379 no one questions enterprise zones the developers dont the attorneys dont they will certify anything sent to them
957380 if we didnt have that 3 foot strip we wouldnt be able to do anything
957381 we are extremely pleased that after eight months of effort pierre hall and his organization were able to put this together the rockers will be a great addition to the league
957382 it is very exciting for us to have this wonderful new facility and to be part of the fast growing aba
957383 theres no doubt that this is a league on the move and we are proud to be a part of it we have tryouts scheduled a dance team and mascot tryouts scheduled and have our ticket sales sponsorship sales and intern program in full swing we will be ready and strong
957384 one disadvantage is that the size and health of a countrys economy is dependent upon its supply of gold not the resourcefulness of its people and businesses
957385 many advocate a return to the gold standard it would enforce fiscal discipline a balanced budget and limit government intervention however a fixed money supply dependent on gold reserves would limit economic growth many businesses would not get funded for lack of capital
957386 people that vote decide nothing people who count the votes decide everything

957388 the civil service process is designed to protect employees from political interference

957405 if we have one big line coming out it will be similar to the one that crosses the m54 by telford the smaller ones taking different routes may be less conspicuous
957406 it would be 10 times the cost to go underground ofgen would not allow it because the cost of electricity would go up

957438 now theyre not just throwing darts in the dark which is typically how these decisions are made

957449 we will see huge capital flows both from and to india in coming years and that is an opportunity for us as a financial information company as well as for international investors who want to take advantage of this profound trend

957523 in response to several irregularities in the past where individual staff members students and other constituencies had seen it fit to invite the media to cover events such as disciplinary hearings and discussions between management and labour unions despite this being unheard of
957524 occasionally we have had reporters on campus intending to cover disciplinary hearings and refusing to leave campus it should also be said that sometimes we are reflected in the wrong light by some reporters and when we have requested a correction or apology based on facts we got none

957543 since june 2008 as employees we have failed to come to work because amongst other things the salaries that we get are simply not enough to cover transport costs
957544 indeed the pay has at times been enough for transport for two days only and this has demotivated us
957545 our institutions have either experienced a mass exodus of experienced staff and absenteeism leading to little work being done and carried out by either under qualified or non qualified personnel

957570 governance comprises the processes and systems by which an organization or a society operates
957571 one should distinguish the concept of governance from its associated concept politics politics involves processes by which a group of people with initially divergent opinions or interests reach collective decisions generally regarded as binding on the group and enforced as common policy governance on the other hand conveys the administrative and process oriented elements of governing rather than its antagonistic ones

957583 refuses to be a collection of political statements without any clear criteria of value
957584 we had to publish as soon as possible with what we had
957585 we were more preoccupied with keeping the newspaper alive than adding the initially planned pages
957586 like in any household there were two contradicting views when it came to the switch
957587 however everyone has been working twice as hard to fill the sacred new layout and the new sections
957588 al akhbar is a leftist opposition newspaper but is not the newspaper of the opposition
957589 the identity of al akhbar was always clear for those who were working in it but it was ambiguous for its readers the new version was partly meant to clarify this issue and to present a newspaper that doesnt conform to the stereotype of a newspaper belonging to the syrian iranian axis
957590 vocation is to defend civil rights and it is perhaps the only arab newspaper that openly advocates and deals with what are usually called taboo issues such as the rights of homosexuals and sexual freedom in general
957591 its not about marginalizing politics but about giving more space to other issues that are equally if not more important if there is nothing extremely important on the political scene on a given day why would we write a column about politics

957593 islam is not a religion nor is it a cult in its fullest form it is a complete total 100 system of life

957595 i have agreed with gareth that is it liverpool have all the time in the world that they want to raise the money
957596 i dont know if gareth barry will leave aston villa or not but i am not on his case i like gareth barry and i like two or three other players
957597 i just knew there was a woman in there because my sister knew her
957598 i searched the rooms and found her asleep in the bedroom she woke as i picked her up and she was crying and very distressed i carried her out
957599 the smoke was black and it was hard to breathe but we made it my sister and her boyfriend were also very brave and went into the flat to try and look for her
957600 she was worried about her two cats but i had already managed to get them both safe i am just so glad we were walking by at that time of night
957601 his actions were very brave and he deserves the highest praise
957602 he did save her life she was asleep in bed and the smoke could easily have killed her she may not have even woken up
957603 fortunately as they were walking past they spotted the smoke and took action
957604 we were prepared to welcome proposals for a long term relationship with a new substantial investor to help establish albion as a successful premier league club
957605 we stated we would shut the door on this at the end of july because we did not want anything off the pitch impacting on the new season
957606 there has been some initial contact from a few third parties but we have received no firm proposals whatsoever
957607 during the past seven weeks it has been business as usual as we endeavour to strike the right balance between organising the clubs finances and giving ourselves as good a chance as possible of establishing albion in the premier league
957608 i had two weeks of training with liverpool so it wasnt as if id done nothing ive had a good few sessions with joe now and weve worked hard and im feeling really sharp
957609 i havent played a lot of football since the end of last season so its just money in the bank to play it helps get you ready for the start of the season i feel really sharp
957610 he got a good ball through to him and he took a nice touch although i thought he was offside i just tried to stay big and fortunately the ball hit me and i got a good block on it
957611 everyone knows that we can still improve and weve probably got to improve for the start of the new season
957612 friendly games arent easy to play well in with the amount of substitutions and things like that but the lads dug in really hard in hot conditions
957613 i thought we played reasonably well and it was good to get a clean sheet hopefully we can build on that against real mallorca
957614 you have to get yourself involved they are a top bunch of lads and they have helped me settle really well
957615 you always have to get involved in the banter because it helps you settle in even easier
957616 its the best pre season ive had here with the players physically they had a really good programme to stick to as they had last season and they came back at 75 per cent of their maximum fitness
957617 tony daley fitness coach has been different class absolutely superb in terms of his programmes for the players through the summer
957618 he has run all the fitness side of things with the physios and the doctor we have managed to steer clear of any injuries
957619 so from that point of view its been a really successful pre season it wont count for a jot unless we do it in the championship of course so our feet are firmly on the floor
957620 chris took the penalties at colchester in his last season there he scored 18 goals and 10 of those were penalties
957621 weve had our trouble from the spot but i think he might be toiling against sylvan ebanks blake who takes them fairly emphatically as well
957622 it would be a fair tussle as well as a meeting of minds between them i decide who takes the penalties anyway
957623 he can lead the line he works his socks off and hes a real handful to play against he creates chances for other people as well because of his physical presence
957624 like dion dublin hes also terrific to have around the place i know what im getting with iwelumo from the moment i spoke to him and met him he came across as a proper bloke
957625 he wanted to come here from the moment he knew wanted him looking at him on saturday you could see the desire hes got
957626 hes a good character and a sound lad who works his socks off he has scored 45 goals in the last three years and if you look at any of the big fellows in our league it stands up well
957627 quite a few of those are penalties but you still have to score them as we have found to our cost
957628 jay bothroyd darren potter and michael kightly have missed penalties for us so its a skill as well
957629 weve lost three players gary breen seyi olofinjana and freddy eastwood ive been delighted with the four signings ive made
957630 weve got richard stearman who i think is going to be terrific although he had a tough time of it in the first half on saturday
957631 hes forming a new partnership with jody craddock kevin foley and george elokobi avid jones was excellent on saturday and weve signed sam vokes and chris iwelumo
957632 we had a terrific end to last season so there was no need to make that many changes the players are a season older and a season wiser from the start of last season
957633 weve got a nice squad of players but whether its the strongest ive had here will be determined at the end of the season
957634 how the hell am i going to keeper expectations on the ground im not bothered people can expect what they like
957635 weve got to go out and play and im not interested in what anyones opinions are good bad or indifferent
957636 the players have to be single minded and they have to go and win football matches thats all
957637 when i say im not bothered i want people to think were a good team and that theyre a great bunch of lads who play good football and win matches
957638 we made an enquiry but i dont think we could reach an agreement so we move on
957639 my philosphy is that if you have an interest in a player you know what your valuation is if it cant be done it cant be done and you move on i would suggest it is dead in the water
957640 i havent had a conversation with anybody from bolton and id be surprised if anybody else has
957641 this is football but none of the players bolton might have mentioned today would have any chance of going there im pretty sure of that
957642 scott has signed a four year deal plus a years option in the clubs favour there is no buy back clause in his contract
957643 they all picked up little knocks in training it was a bit like a war zone one went down then another went down and then another
957644 they were all very minor but i didnt think it was worth the risk of sticking them on a coach at 8 30am and travelling for four hours
957645 when people come into the town centre it will be as it used to be a one stop shop where everything they require will be within walking distance
957646 by 2018 1 000 million 1billion will be put into west bromwich there has never been anything like it in this area
957647 at the moment plans affect around 40 per cent of the town but the final result will mean 70 per cent is changed it is going to look entirely different and will have a european feel with new modern buildings cafes and bars to encourage 24 7 use of the town centre
957648 the plans we are discussing at the moment are to install a leisure centre with a swimming pool somewhere in the middle of the town
957649 it is going to be years yet and it is taking a long time
957650 by the time it is all done everybody could be gone and finished
957651 there was what looked like a frost in his eye i was just shocked really because wed never heard of a baby with this condition we thought he was going to be blind
957652 they said it was a pretty straight forward operation its just a slit in the corner of the eye and then they suck the cataract out just the same as in an older person
957653 at first the contact lenses were really irritating him but hes doing really well now
957654 hes just a few steps behind other babies of his age
957655 hes just starting to reach out for things where others would have done it a few weeks earlier
957656 they say he might have a slight squint but they can fix that up eventually blakes brilliant hes a bit grumpy as hes got some teeth coming through other than that hes really happy
957657 a key problem with metro patronage is there is no opportunity to recover lost journeys
957658 if there are problems on a bus route passengers will switch to another bus metro passengers have no alternative but to switch to a bus or possibly a car or cancel their journey altogether
957659 the figures are a little distorted i have travelled on that tram in rush hour and it is packed so full the conductor cannot get to everyone
957660 our research indicates there has been an increase in passengers
957661 i am very grateful to our head teacher pat hazlehurst because she allowed the choir to rehearse during the last week of term
957662 she is the one who made it all happen i am really looking forward to the new term when i will see the children again
957663 vicky wanted to make sure she could see them sing so she asked for them to perform while she was signing the register so they knew how touched she was to have them there
957664 he was a good man and i just wanted to let people know i cant remember where he was travelling to i just know he was on the way to his depot i identified him on thursday he was the only one dead
957665 everybody loved him we were just doing up the house i was getting the hall stairs and landing done for him as a surprise

957667 here grandad youve been a sport have a drink on us
957668 but these days when you are talking about white powdery substances you cant play it cheap you have to take it seriously

957672 the problem is that people will probably indulge in the cheap beer and it will affect their health
957673 its so cheap some people will probably be able to drink all day
957674 crowds of people may come in their droves because its cheap
957675 we werent the first pub to put the prices down we only continued what the marksman has done
957676 we couldnt stand by and lose customers thats why we decided to drop the prices
957677 we get the same customers all the while we havent had any drop in custom
957678 you are going to get a lot more people who just think they can drink all through the day and its not going to do them the world of good
957679 the way the government has been going on about all this cheap beer someones got to make a stand somewhere
957680 i love looking at the old vehicles and my children are big car fanatics so its ideal for all of us

957683 a lot of people have already contacted us to say they are appalled at the proposals for the new sand and gravel quarries off swindon road
957684 people see these proposals as a threat to the environment and also have a number of other concerns such as the amount of noise it will generate with potentially lots of lorries coming past their houses
957685 at the moment it is just a proposal and no planning application has been submitted but what we are saying to residents is we want to hear their views now
957686 but when you have a knee injury you just never know

957689 tra ex manager di stato riciclati alla politica e completamente mancanti di ogni capacit di comunicare fossero anche bugie basti pensare che il portavoce era sircana rispetto al quale i pur stranissimi bondi o banaiuti diventano dei maestri di fascino e comunicazione

957691 i felt he wasnt going to stop and so stood on the road in front of him trying to wave him down but he carried on driving and when he was about one metre from me i had to jump out of the way
957692 i cant over emphasise how angry i am this is happening too many times the sentences the courts are handing out are too lenient and the cases are taking too long to come to court
957693 i was told i flew through the air and hit a bank and ended up in long grass my friends could not find me straight away
957694 all i heard was a massive whoof then woke up on the bank i have no recollection of going through the air or landing it all happened so quickly i feel very lucky to be talking to you
957695 i ended up under the front wheel of a truck and had to have my leg amputated this time i heard brakes and became airborne i landed on the road my artificial leg was a few metres away

957698 is the decriminalisation of sex work in the best interests of the country
957699 but in sex work they are exposed to exploitative and abusive conditions
957700 if we decriminalise they can have recourse to the law
957701 from an extensive mapping exercise we found there were about 1 200 people working in the sex industry in cape town at any one time
957702 when i see prostitutes i see women who are repeatedly and continuously abused
957703 nobody grows up saying when i grow up i want to be a prostitute most women in this kind of work are absolutely abused from start to finish
957704 the woman is a victim a victim of circumstance for a start
957705 but if we do draw them out where do we take them to given the high level of unemployment
957706 great were going to be hauling someone up the stairs tonight

957716 we wish paul well but despite his immediate impact at managerial level we would still have made exactly the same decision in appointing mick
957717 at the time micks credentials were first class as they still are now we remain extremely pleased with the job he has done and the way the squad has developed over the last two years
957718 its not only micks football managerial abilities that endeared him to us but his other personal qualities too qualities that perhaps many people dont outwardly see
957719 mick has so many positive attributes that in my opinion sets him apart from many other managers in the game to the extent that i have never been more comfortable in the choice we made two years ago
957720 there is no doubting pauls abilities as a player but going into the premier league where the standard is so high will show how good he is as a manager
957721 i went on record at the time to say how impressed we had been with pauls interview for the wolves job we just felt he needed to cut his managerial teeth at a lower level before landing such a major position
957722 he has done that to impressive effect fully deserving his premier league chance at blackburn where he has to follow the success of mark hughes
957723 ladies and gentlemen im not going to make a long spiel about the merits of our next act you all know her you all love her so please make her welcome lily le clare
957724 id like to begin with one i didnt write but which holds a lot of meaning for me

957729 the song was wonderful darling one day it will be huge number one
957730 i put everything into that song shel i left myself bare to the world
957731 and the world will worship you for it lily i promise you and the song will be legendary
957732 how could you say that sheldon how could you think such a thing after all ive done for you
957733 i cant stay here for ever i want more from life i want action and fame
957734 and youll have them your talent will be lauded and youll gain many fans
957735 why are you being so negative you never support me or encourage my dreams
957736 youll see with or without you im on my way
957737 it will be with me lily but not for the right reasons i wish you could really enjoy your success you are going to be a star people will flock to hear you sing

957739 the flats will give people their own freedom as they will have their own front door they will have care there if they need it and company as well

957741 dudley councils long term aim is to introduce five extra care housing schemes one in each of the boroughs five townships by 2015 and this funding goes a long way in helping us achieve this
957742 with this scheme we can help people aged 55 or over remain independent and active in their local communities with the comfort of knowing there is support on hand if they need it now or in the future
957743 i guarantee ive learnt more from you in our short time of knowing each other than i ever have from anyone ever

957767 we are in danger of conceiving of war in narrow military terms alone and thus getting the politics wrong

957776 they dominated possession dominated the speed of the ruck a few of their tries were just their blokes were willing to run harder than we were willing to tackle
957777 i think theres still a lot to work on our defence got a little bit patchy at times and even in attack in that second half we went away from our game plan
957778 all in all its a win and it keeps us up around the eight there which is good
957779 as a teenager i heard john kennedys summons to citizenship and then as a student at georgetown i heard that call clarified by a professor named carroll quigley who said to us that america was the greatest nation in history because our people had always believed in two things that tomorrow can be better than today and that every one of us has a personal moral responsibility to make it so
957780 the methods can be summed up under three headings a a triple front penetration in politics education and journalism b the recruitment of men of ability chiefly from certain universities and the linking of these men to the group by matrimonial alliances and by gratitude for titles and positions of power and c the influencing of public policy by placing members of the group in positions of power shielded as much as possible from public attention
957781 eastern establishment has played a very significant role in the history of the united states in the last generation
957782 hes great with pr and having his staff post on blog sites and jumping on the bandwagon for issues but when it comes to actually getting those issues framed and set up he hasnt done much heavy lifting
957783 his strength is fundraising and as a face for the camera and thats probably what mccain needs right now

957785 despite the important role of jews among the bolsheviks most jews were not bolsheviks before the revolution however jews were prominent among the bolsheviks and once the revolution was underway the vast majority of russian jews became sympathizers and active participants jews were particularly visible in the cities and as leaders in the army and in the revolutionary councils and committees for example there were 23 jews among 62 bolsheviks in the all russian central executive committee elected at the second congress of soviets in october 1917 jews were leaders of the movement and to a great extent they were its public face their presence was particularly notable at the top levels of the cheka and ogpu two successive acronyms for the secret police here slezkine provides statistics on jewish overrepresentation in these organizations especially in supervisory roles and quotes historian leonard shapiros comment that anyone who had the misfortune to fall into the hands of the cheka stood a very good chance of finding himself confronted with and possibly shot by a jewish investigator during the 1930s slezkine reports the secret police now known as the nkvd was one of the most jewish of all soviet institutions with 42 of the 111 top officials being jewish at this time 12 of the 20 nkvd directorates were headed by ethnic jews including those in charge of state security police labor camps and resettlement deportation the gulag was headed by ethnic jews from its beginning in 1930 until the end of 1938 a period that encompasses the worst excesses of the great terror they were in slezkines remarkable phrase stalins willing executioners slezkine appears to take a certain pride in the drama of the role of the jews in russia during these years thus he says they were among the most exuberant crusaders against bourgeois habits during the great transformation the most disciplined advocates of socialist realism during the great retreat from revolutionary internationalism and the most passionate prophets of faith hope and combat during the great patriotic war against the nazis sometimes his juxtapositions between his descriptions of jewish involvement in the horror of the early soviet period and the life styles of the jewish elite seem deliberately jarring lev kopelev a jewish writer who witnessed and rationalized the ukrainian famine in which millions died horrible deaths of starvation and disease as an historical necessity is quoted saying you mustnt give in to debilitating pity we are the agents of historical necessity we are fulfilling our revolutionary duty on the next page slezkine describes the life of the largely jewish elite in moscow and leningrad where they attended the theater sent their children to the best schools had peasant women whose families were often the victims of mass murder for nannies spent weekends at pleasant dachas and vacationed at the black sea again slezkine discusses the heavily jewish nkvd and the jewish leadership of the great terror of the 1930s then he writes that in 1937 the prototypical jewish state official probably would have been living in elite housing in downtown moscow with access to special stores a house in the country dacha and a live in peasant nanny or maid he writes long and lovingly detailed sketches of life at the dachas of the elite the open verandas overlooking small gardens enclosed by picket fences the reader is left on his own to recall the horrors of the ukrainian famine the liquidation of the kulaks and the gulag
957786 any man who has once acclaimed violence as his method must inexorably choose falsehood as his principle
957787 and the simple step of a simple courageous man is not to partake in falsehood not to support false actions let falsehood enter the world let it even reign in the world but not with my help

957831 we are determined to put on an event that is as inclusive as possible as parents ourselves we really want to give all parts of our community the opportunity to experience a major outdoor music festival right on their doorstop as a result we have taken the decision to allow every adult playing full price the opportunity to bring up to two under 12s absolutely free with the event being on a bank holiday monday we felt that allowing kids to go free was a great way of making it as easy as possible for as many families from milton keynes and the surrounding region to come along and enjoy what is going to be an unforgettable day of music in an incredible setting however we have and want to be responsible so therefore unaccompanied minors will not be allowed access
957832 we are determined to put the last days of summer and this region on the music map and will continue to work hard for the area and its families we hope this move allows as many of them as possible to come along and enjoy this superb festival
957833 i think its only right that kids get to come along and enjoy live music theres nothing like it after opening the john peel stage at this years glastonbury the band are honoured to be opening the last days of summer at stowe in fact it is great that festivals like the last days of summer are happening as it gives bands and artists the chance to play live to large audiences across the country i believe this is the first time something like this has happened like this in the area so i hope the music fans and families there come along and have a great time its great that the organisers have been able to get richard ashcroft to play as he has been amazing headlining with the verve at glastonbury and t in the park and they have gone down a storm and we are thrilled to be part of a line up that features so many fantastic acts
957834 this year is our first experience of playing at festivals so we are very excited to be invited to play at the last days of summer i have just been told the line up and its very cool i am so excited about sharing the stage with richard ashcroft supergrass athlete the rascals royworld and the fun lovin criminals these guys are all great live performers and its going to be an amazing show its the best feeling playing live to an appreciative audience of all ages and the atmosphere will be electric for us and the people that come along

957930 after realising that the pandemic has seriously affected people across all sections of society including journalists the union will soon launch a programme to avail arvs to our members
957931 beneficiaries will get the drugs for free because most journalists cannot afford to buy the drugs as they are beyond their reach the programme will make it easier for members living with hiv and aids to have access to arvs
957932 we have almost finalised the whole issue and it will be rolled out very soon but we still need to get a medical practitioner we can partner with who will be doing the dispensing of the arvs because this is not just an easy process
957933 we also have to find a mechanism to disseminate information to the members and alert members who would want to benefit from the programme
957934 we should know whether the beneficiaries would want the whole thing to be made public or private
957935 up to 75 people will benefit when the scheme is launched the scheme would cater for members their wives husbands and their children
957936 these will be eligible to benefit from the programme as long as they would require those arvs

957976 what we found was that hiv and aids services particularly provision of anti retroviral therapy have become a lifeline for the health care system in zimbabwe
957977 we have found an innovative way to kill the virus by finding this small region of hiv that is unchangeable
957978 the virus is truly complex and has many tricks up its sleeve
957979 the virus needs at least one constant region and that is the essence of calling it the achilles heel

958108 zegt de bondsvoorzitter fran ois de keersmaecker nvdr dat ik wel een oplossing zal vinden als fellaini weg is tja ik heb geen andere keuze zeker ik zal het zoals altijd wel weer mogen oplossen
958109 ik mag niet eens weg en ga ervan uit dat ik voor de rechtsbackpositie in aanmerking kom
958110 ik heb een keer een goed gesprek gehad zoals dat hoort iedereen krijgt een kans en dat is ook zoals het hoort in topvoetbal
958111 binnen feyenoord heeft ook nooit iemand gezegd dat ik weg mocht
958112 i told you so why did you leave a good job you idiot
958113 if you fail well fail together and then well figure it out well be okay
958114 we bezorgen niet meer tot 22 00 uur maar tot 21 00 uur dat kan ook schelen
958115 als je weet dat je wordt gefilmd durf je misschien niet iets fouts te doen
958116 ze hebben er helemaal geen last van wij blijven dit systeem zeker gebruiken
958117 de politie toont belangstelling het korps in den bosch gebruikt sinds kort onze cameraatjes voor agenten op mountainbike of paard en zelfs in de politiewagen ze lopen er gewoon mee rond en maken opnames die beelden kunnen helpen bij hun onderzoek
958118 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available we should ask those who make profits out of reveling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing

958125 race one was pretty good starting from the second row i had a so so start and then got up to third behind the top two guys bayliss and kiyonari
958126 i was three seconds away with eight laps to go but i started to believe i could do it and closed the gap it was so close on the final lap one tenth covering all three riders it was a good race for me and my team
958127 i was a little bit unlucky in race two my clutch slipped at the start and i couldnt do anything
958128 they overtook me everywhere and i was down in tenth or something then on lap two i tried to recover some positions but i lost the rear going into a corner
958129 it was a miracle i managed to stay on i went all the way through the gravel and came back on the track in last that was too bad i put my head down and tried to get some points im a little frustrated because i could have had another podium
958130 the reason i couldnt restart was because i took a short cut returning back to the pits again after my crash
958131 it was impossible for me to do it a different way and its not even very clear how i couldve done it differently it was very frustrating the race up until my crash was just amazing the bike was working really well and i knew i had so much more to give
958132 the situation regarding robbin was really a mess from start to finish
958133 the team didnt get any information that he wasnt allowed to restart and the rules concerning riders taking shortcuts back to the garage after a crash are very vague
958134 on top of that when the second red flag occurred due to a huge accident for craig jones none of the riders in front of joshua brookes who had made a similar shortcut as robbin had previously made were penalised
958135 we put in a protest but were told that the difference was that when the second red flag happened the race was over whereas when the first red flag came out it was to signal the fact that the race had been stopped and that a restart would follow
958136 it has been a tough rally and a weekend full of problems especially yesterday which was unbelievable everybody has been working flat out to get the car competitive but it just wasnt good enough were sixth and thats how it is
958137 when everything was working it felt very good but i lost the feeling at times yesterday and on friday there were times when i felt i just couldnt push the car is still not 100 per cent
958138 today was much better though but by then wed lost too much time to be able to climb back up any higher we have a week until germany now for the team to keep working on the car and well see what we can do there the first time on tarmac it will be very difficult but we really hope we can be on the case
958139 a lot of preparation has gone into this next race but a lot depends on whether some new parts will be available in time for road america
958140 we have an intensive ongoing development programme in place and although we are clearly competitive with a great run and outright victory at lime rock followed by second in class at mid ohio we need to go even better at road america
958141 its time for us to step up to the plate and the patron highcroft racing team have proved time and again that they can keep pushing the boundaries and i have every confidence in them
958142 we are very happy to again have the wtcc drivers with us for what is the biggest event of the year in south american motorsports
958143 actually we will be the only brand bringing in foreign drivers who are driving for the same brand elsewhere in the world and this proves once again the strength of a global brand like chevrolet
958144 your creativity is basically your expression of the inner force that you feel with each new experience
958145 you both get ready car is coming nani has died
958146 i am sorry i have given everyone so much trouble or how much of a bother i have been to all of you due to my pathetic condition everyone has gone so much out of their way
958147 a cold case review is triggered if there is a no suspect within a month or if there is an appeal
958148 another review might take into consideration why the evidence failed to provide a conviction but i very much suspect that there will not be another review
958149 assuming that all the evidence they had was gone through with a fine tooth comb there is nowhere else they can go
958150 the only new forensic technique available to the police is dna analysis infinitesimally small quantities are needed now to produce a match i would imagine that the clothing will be looked at very closely indeed
958151 a breakthrough could come with new suspects they might come in from other cases if somebody is arrested in another case and circumstantial evidence links them to this one
958152 the other way is through a confession or someone telling police they have heard a confession
958153 blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord hosanna
958154 worldwide deployment to maintain control quelling backlashes of outrage fighting the next face of terror prepared for each new conflict you might as well submit
958155 buy you rogaine when you start losing all your hair
958156 even high energy bills are typically only 2 to 4 percent of a households discretionary income
958157 you know theyre a third of what they spend on healthcare or theyre a third of what they spend on the car theyre a quarter of what they spend on housing
958158 a lot of us are struggling to simply pay that months bill
958159 they will reduce your bill you will get your money back over a period of months and years
958160 everyone always says that cfls are expensive so since theyre 99 cents we decided to go for a few
958161 well figure out what burns out first in the house and thats where well go
958162 it makes sense to have a goal if youre willing to tie impacts to it and results and responsibility for it declaring a goal without responsibility is a waste of time for everybody
958163 we want to achieve 15 percent if were successful we think its the same as avoiding three new power plants it will save the state 6 billion some outside groups have estimated that it will create over 8 000 green collar jobs if in fact we fall a little short and weve only reduced consumption 12 percent and it only creates 7 000 jobs and avoids two power plants i think that is a victory for consumers in maryland
958164 with biotechnology we feel like were part of first world agriculture
958165 we dont have to be jealous of the cornfields of iowa
958166 and when we eat its very poorly because our situation is very difficult here and i can tell you this we and our children and our grandchildren will have to eat each other when were hungry
958167 twenty years ago the international institutions told us that there was no sense you know in producing grain
958168 we better buy them and bring them from outside in the last two decades grain producers went broke
958169 as bad as wars are its even more dangerous not to have enough food
958170 we believe in this government that the first thing we need to do is provide food for our population
958171 its a global response and from our own part were scaling up our support for agricultural development particularly in africa
958172 at the moment if the weather is good we can provide all the electricity from the solar panels and the wind turbine
958173 in japan we have a lot of earthquake and it absorbs the shock and changes to the heat
958174 japanese company culture is typically more focused on the supply side or technology gimmicks or technology solutions
958175 the majority is very much against introducing so called cap and trade or carbon tax
958176 the establishment here says oh look were ahead of the europeans were 20 years ahead of the europeans thats just on the face of it wrong
958177 they want to get away from these pork barrel projects the spending on roads that was very much emphasized in the 90s as a way to prime the economic pump
958178 to lead the world japan must take the initiative by achieving a low carbon society
958179 a few days ago i went back but i could not find my house there used to be a big mulberry tree in front of our home but now it is all black and most of the branches have been blown off around the base of the tree were pieces of clothing and other trash i saw something in the remaining branches and when i got closer i saw that it was a blackened human scalp
958180 during the operation 500 foreign taleban including arabs chechens and punjabis were killed
958181 many locals were displaced and went to the desert around garmsir or to lashkar gah we provided assistance to 1500 families and we held meetings with the tribal elders in garmsir they promised to help with security and now we see that garmsir is safe
958182 they are just not engaging with marine forces the way they were
958183 only those areas close to the district centre like kharko and hazarajuft are free of them the rest of the district has a lot and they still conduct guerilla attacks sometimes
958184 garmsir is as quiet as lashkar gah the regional capital
958185 the americans are there in those uniforms with green and brown dots all over cursing the taleban over loudspeakers
958186 someone with property damage goes to the civil military operations centre
958187 they report the damage to the marines there sometimes the marines will verify the claim once this is verified the person is paid
958188 i gave them my taskira identification document and they pinpointed my house on a map and then they gave me 6500 pakistani rupees about 90 dollars its not very much but at least they gave me something
958189 they locate the houses on gps and then they pay 100 to 500 dollars for a destroyed house with this amount people cannot even reconstruct one wall
958190 the americans gave money but to only a few people
958191 and it was very little just 5 000 afghani 100 dollars or so to each family
958192 we could not see even a single green plant in garmsir
958193 it used to be that garmsir was green from jauza to qaos months of the afghan solar calendar roughly may to november with all the agricultural lands but everything was destroyed in the fighting kharko was bombed so fiercely that no one could recognise it i have seen craters up to 20 metres in depth where there used to be houses very few people have gone back to their lands they are afraid of land mines and can not go to their fields our delegation hit a land mine in our car the car was destroyed but we all survived
958194 we had to flee garmsir with nothing every morning i go to the bazaar and collect leftover food to give to my children sometimes i can find things to eat but other nights we go to sleep hungry last night we had no food at all i cannot go back to my village because i am afraid that the fighting will start again my sons are too small to work my husband is ill and cannot move it is just me trying to feed everyone
958195 they are just trying to get something for nothing they are not the right people
958196 they could not get the assistance out to the far areas of garmsir we spent two months in the desert and never saw any assistance our house is completely destroyed there are not two bricks together i have gone to the americans a dozen times but they have not helped me
958197 according to our survey the population of garmsir is around 100 000
958198 there is a health clinic in garmsir but it has no medicine
958199 it has no ambulance or other facilities so we have to come to lashkar gah in those hospitals sick people get even worse
958200 the decision was that we would hold no talks over the next weeks but we also hope that the other side will show its honesty
958201 there is no use in trying to pressure pakistan through verbal attacks or by cutting relations
958202 the cabinet should have considered the political and economic consequences of their decision i am sure that most of the ministers still have no idea of what they were doing they just raised their hands
958203 the government should have sought an alterative before deciding on a boycott of meetings
958204 of course we can cut down on some imports from pakistan but we cannot just sew our mouths shut and not eat anything
958205 pakistan has no other market for its poor quality goods pakistan will also sustain damage
958206 karzais government has failed and this is now acknowledged both here and outside
958207 now karzai wants to distract peoples attention by attacking pakistan and blaming it for all his problems afghans do not like the government of pakistan so karzai is trying to curry favour among the electorate
958208 pakistan has deployed its troops along the border with afghanistan and isi is shifting al qaeda from iraq to afghanistan
958209 pakistans military and intelligence circles are interfering so strongly that the afghan government had no choice
958210 afghanistan is a consumer country and 80 percent of our imports are from pakistan
958211 if the border closes we may be able to supply ourselves from the north or the west but pakistan makes two billion us dollars per year on trade with afghanistan and if they lose it they will suffer a blow
958212 i am sure that isi encouraged the taleban in this warning
958213 they want to say to the afghan government okay you are threatening us but we can cut off your food we have seen nothing good from karzais policies over the past six years just harm if you have no power why are you screaming
958214 karzais verbal attacks on pakistan and the cabinets decision to suspend relations are just like children playing
958215 one minute they fight with each other the next minute they make up my advice to karzai is be calm dont talk so much your speech has brought only harm
958216 with biotechnology we feel like were part of first world agriculture
958217 we dont have to be jealous of the cornfields of iowa
958218 and when we eat its very poorly because our situation is very difficult here and i can tell you this we and our children and our grandchildren will have to eat each other when were hungry

958356 we would appeal to the chinese government to come in full force to exploit these minerals
958357 such military to military dialogue and engagement can increase transparency and promote stability
958358 we encourage china to be more open about its military strategy doctrine and budgets as it modernizes its military
958359 although asean itself is not a security organization engaging other countries and other militaries in the region on security issues can be a positive step so long as it is done in an open and non exclusionary manner

958377 connecting people with wildlife inspiring caring for nature and advance conservation action
958378 from a young age its an almost instinctive human emotion to want to connect with animals as children weve all fantasized what it must be like to have a tail or wings maybe even feathers its this curiosity that fuels our imagination and makes us want to learn more about animals and their relationships to us once activated this curiosity never leaves even years later when we become adults
958379 it takes time and privacy especially working out the methods which i wouldnt have guessed anyone really knew in the lab at that time
958380 people given these kinds of responsibilities with this kind of power at their fingertips we have to make sure that they are not likely to do harm to others or misuse that authority be it intentionally or be it because of some mental problem
958381 these kinds of situations cry out for reexamination of our standards

958383 china has a huge economy and market for us besides being in dire need of natural resources and energy to support its economy the country is also hungry for almost any other product including fertilizer for its agricultural sector
958384 however we dont have the capacity to fill the market with our products the free trade agreement will only benefit china and other asean countries that have that capacity
958385 our exports to china mostly benefit a few people who have a lot of capital including businesspeople in the natural resources and energy sectors we have many other labor intensive industries such as fertilizer metal pulp and paper and furniture that should be upgraded so that we can compete internationally and export the finished goods to china
958386 we need to produce goods that are complementary not competitive with chinas products such as rubber palm oil agricultural products and fish and boost our tourism industry since many chinese are eager to visit indonesia
958387 china is more aware of the historical attachment than we are they really want to make big investments here to maintain and increase the ties however we are the ones who are not ready to receive those investments
958388 china is the biggest country in east asia while indonesia has the largest economy in southeast asia i think we will raise our leverage against the u s and japan if we foster closer ties with china
958389 with president yudhoyonos positive commitment prime minister wen will encourage chinese business leaders to visit indonesia and study our energy industry

958393 many customers complain that they cannot deregister which means that they keep receiving messages which in turn eats up their phone credit others complain that they never received what was advertised in the commercials
958394 we realize that it is a big industry thats why it needs specific regulation
958395 firstly each time a customer signs up for a service the provider must give him information on what the service is all about how to use it and how to deregister
958396 not complying with the new regulations could result in suspension or a total ban on their operations
958397 many customers face difficulties deregistering as they have to go through various stages before they are finally in the clear but meanwhile the operator keeps on charging them
958398 sometimes we get so many customers accessing our services that have no option but to send out the same messages more than once
958399 we will stick to our beliefs and not let the voice of justice down we refuse to promote harmony unless garuda hands us the documents related to the murder
958400 giving over the documents is out of the question because this case is a civil case the real question is whether garuda including its crew and management had any reason to let the activist die
958401 first we are still investigating the case second we have the authority to reject any request by a special rapporteur to visit indonesia and third we have plans to host three special rapporteurs this year and next year excluding alston

958454 i have an open mind on two or three positions at the moment but that is what pre season is there for
958455 i had felt like seeing my boyfriend preye i had some news to share with him and lately he has been so effective at absorbing my news and shocking biography that i just loosened up and told him every thing i have decided to make him my diary since i am so bad at recall i felt if i committed everything to preyes intelligent head he will help me in future when i need to quickly remember something so last week i called preye up i needed both to talk to him and to share some warmth i had some early morning appointment in the lekki area of i spent some thirty minutes at the bus stop before finally deciding to take a ride to the ikeja bus stop we spent another ten minutes before leaving to go to obalende the drive to obalende was executed in less than twenty minutes the road was so free there was no traffic from obalende we were warned that there was a broken down trailer along the lekki expressway and the bus driver charged us extra for that reason we did not buy the huge traffic story we felt the driver just wanted to increase the fare twenty minutes into our trip to lekki the road closed up we had to divert and take a presumed short cut along the sandy and lonely estate back roads those routes were blocked as well other drivers had also decided on those same routes at the end of four hours we finally emerged on a free road by this time it was a quarter to twelve i called preye before getting to the estate his phone kept going into voice mail i tried the alternative line it was ringing without an answer my one thought was preye has gone to sleep and when preye goes to sleep everything had better wait till morning i got into the estate still trying to get him on the phone i did not know how to get to his house all the houses looked identical and at that time of the night it was very confusing i started wandering towards where i thought his house might be at this time i had called so much that my battery was running low at one gate i stopped when i saw the security man i told him where preye worked and the colour of his car he pointed me to the next lane and i moved over until i discovered the houses there actually looked different from the one i felt should be preyes house i kept moving until i found myself where i had started from the estate was gradually growing still with only occasional cars moving through the pools of water and splashing some on me my legs were also peeling inside the court shoes i wore i stopped at a wide gate and started talking to the gate man i explained that i was lost and my friend was not answering his calls i told him that i knew my friend had slept and it was not easy to get him to wake when he had done that he was very understanding but i could see he looked like he was not totally buying my story he asked me to keep trying the number as hotels in the area were very expensive then he advised me not to let any body know that i was stranded because the estate haboured high class ritual killers my blood ran cold when he mentioned the fact that there may be ritual killers on the estate i refused to move further ahead especially as i did not know where else to go i begged him to open the gate for me so i can stay outside the grounds for the night he told me that he could not do that because he would lose his job if his employers should see me i promised him that i will be as invisible as possible and that they will never see me i told him that i was a career woman and offered to even show him my identity card then i started sobbing i was so scarred my whole body shook with the fear i felt finally the man was touched enough to open the gate for me he explained to me that his madam will collect the remote that controlled the gate as soon as she got in and i could not go out until she left for work in the morning i told him i was okay with the arrangement he took me into a guard house that was just the size of a four by five feet carton i was shocked to see such a small guard house in such a grand estate it was not wide enough for a man to sit and stretch his legs not to talk of attempting to lie down i expressed my surprise audibly and the gate man told me that the rich people on the estate did not believe that their security men are supposed to lie down they felt they are supposed to be up all night i forgot about my own condition and started being angry at the hypocrisy of these rich people how could a human allow a fellow human being like himself to stay in such a small cubicle it was inhuman i kept fuming and complaining to the security man and the grounds of that house were so big they just planted grasses and flowers everywhere i felt so disgusted the owner of the house occupied the whole upper and lower floors of the duplex alone with his wife it was the height of mans inhumanity to man the guard told me there was a vacant boys quarter that was definitely out of bounds to the security men the occupant of the house was a director of a bank the complex was paid for by the bank i had a mental image of these bankers who brush their teeth with pepsodent whenever they are getting set to smile at us and make us part with our money and yet had no human feeling enough to avail a security guard the use of the toilet in the boys quarters of his house i sat hunched up in the carton shaped room my knees drawn up to my chin i remained like this as my tears continued to flow till morning the guard could not share the room because it was so small he had to wander the grounds till morning and he explained to me that he had problem with migraine which got worse whenever he could not get enough sleep i could not even go outside to ease myself for fear of being seen by the owner of the house at a point i was so pressed i had to wear the gate mans overall and pretend to be the gate man before sneaking out to ease myself at the small gutter behind the guard house i became worried for preyes safety it was unusual for him to ignore his calls for so long the gate man suggested he may have somebody else in the house and was ignoring me i quickly dismissed that theory i told him every other thing could happen except that in the morning i called preye and he informed me that his phone had been on vibration since afternoon when he put it that way during a meeting the other line did not have service inside his house i was relieved that he was alright when i heard preyes voice i sobered up i reflected on an action that put me at such risk because i needed to see preye he was understandably shocked that i had to pass the night in a guard house on his own estate
958456 if i die i would like to have left something to make the world a little better before i go to help people sick like me and prevent others from getting this
958457 the future of the north lies in our hands we should today begin to shape our destiny as a nigerian of northern extraction i feel very unhappy when somebody describes me as a parasite because of oil when i know that i have the capacity to solve my problems and probably do even better through agriculture and education
958458 the population of the north the political delineation of the north resource allocation the relatively low contribution of the north to national gdp and the unusually large presence of the north in positions of power and authority at the centre of this is the politics of oil the allocation of federal revenue accruing mainly from the sale of crude oil
958459 lazy and parasites who rely on other regions for survival and that there is no reason to run away from the truth
958460 these leaders military or democratic were selfish greedy corrupt murderous and parasitic devoid of ideas unfocused visionless and lacking in foresight

958491 i thought it was a very friendly and cordial meeting
958492 he did a lot of listening there was talk of the real pressure women face on this economy hes clearly very engaged
958493 he knew there had been frustration with stuff directed at sen clinton by the media
958494 it was very important for him to reach out to abortion activists
958495 obviously he needed to reach out to women in the same way that he has reached out to latinos and to labor leaders and to environmentalists and even to evangelicals

958613 ik heb nu mom op mijn ringvinger zodat deze te zien is als ik de microfoon vasthou
958614 ik doe veel optredens en ik zou wel aan dat vele reizen kunnen wennen maar laat mij maar dicht bij mijn oma mijn broer en mijn pa zijn
958615 ik laat nu ook de was doen door mijn oma omdat ik keiweinig tijd heb ik ben constant onderweg
958616 ik sta op veel plaatsen op nummer een en ik denk dat ik het zelf nog niet zo goed besef
958617 mijn familie spreekt mij er constant op aan als er iets in de krant staat zelfs voordat ik het soms weet ik had nooit kunnen dromen dat het allemaal zo snel zou gaan
958618 ik zal in peking starten en ik zal er lopen tot mijn benen knakken

958622 kim koos ervoor om in business te vliegen om geen risico te nemen met haar achillespezen waar ze een groot deel van het seizoen last heeft aan gehad nvdr zon vlucht kan heel belastend zijn en in business kan je helemaal plat liggen en heb je ook veel meer ruimte om eens rond te wandelen elodie koos ook voor business gewoon preventief
958623 plus je recupereert sneller van de vlucht ook de terugreis naar brussel zal ik in business class vliegen omdat ik kort erna enkele wedstrijden loop
958624 sowieso zijn ze al het hele seizoen goed bezig maar ze hebben echt pech gehad in de wedstrijden waarin ze zich ook individueel hoopten te plaatsen voor peking als je eens zou uitrekenen hoeveel tegenwind ze al gehad hebben in totaal dit seizoen dan zou je hoog uitkomen
958625 londen was goed maar ze hebben het wat laten liggen in de aflossingen
958626 ondertussen hebben we gemerkt dat de concurrentie allemaal meer is opgeschoven naar die 43 seconden en die tijd zal ook nodig zijn om de finale te halen in peking
958627 als alles perfect loopt is een nieuw belgisch record mogelijk

958635 the twin pillars of twentieth century art the readymade and pure abstraction
958636 the exposure of its outgoing chief executive to the collective wrath of several hundred arts practitioners at a highly charged meeting at the young vic theater in january
958637 i am attracted by the strength of the curatorial staff
958638 i always want to be involved in the intellectual side of art because i have to do that to succeed at fund raising and aligning aspects of the institution and you do feel like your soul is starved if you dont get to an artists studio once in a while but i really do want to focus on the strategic dimension of things
958639 it came as a suggestion from the donor but its something we would have done anyway
958640 i dont know how to compare this asset wise going from one million dollars in the budget to ten million dollars is quite a leap
958641 the beauty of distance songs of survival in a precarious age
958642 obviously its referring to a situation in australia where distances are large but its more about art how it functions and how it relates to the world
958643 we live in an age of globalization and as such if anything goes wrong its really difficult for people to save themselves at the expense of others
958644 do in the future what is appropriate to deliver price stability
958645 the boys and girls who live with hiv are here and we are growing up with many goals
958646 we want to be artists teachers doctors even get married and have kids but achieving these goals will only be possible when we receive the attention we need when we are guaranteed the medicines that we need when we are accepted in schools
958647 its like a little ball that has little dots and is inside me sort of swimming inside me
958648 theres a whole new generation of young people that were born with hiv that are reaching adulthood it presents very interesting challenges
958649 they cant talk about their diagnosis in the school because they can be kicked out they cant talk about it in their communities with their neighbours
958650 we need to start getting young people involved in leadership again in hiv and aids because its easy to get kind of complacent
958651 i want to congratulate all the boys and girls who have graduated and got good grades keep it up
958652 sometimes i have so much fun that i forget i have this
958653 i think that were seeing graphically ps3 games starting to create some distance and some of the other competitors are going to feel that theyre getting long in the tooth looking quite dated because they havent created that ten year vision from a horsepower standpoint
958654 were looking to convert the ps2 owners and the tens of millions of installed base that were playing dvds and playing games on their ps2 to now play blu ray movies and blu ray games with their ps3
958655 i think the reality is that we will win hands down if we convert the ps2 owners to ps3
958656 omg this is so much better than anything on 360

958660 not comment on speculation about future products or product development

958677 im gegensatz zu anderen erkrankungen l sst sich die diagnose
958678 hier steht das pers nliche empfinden der patienten im vordergrund
958679 jeder patient weist eine individuelle schmerzschwelle auf die nicht nur vom derzeitigen k rperlichen sondern auch vom seelischen zustand abh ngt
958680 jedoch l sst sich durch eine erste schmerzlinderung meist der typische teufelskreis durchbrechen
958681 von januar bis ende juli konnten wir 9 300 zimmer in 38 hotels vertraglich absichern mehr als im gesamten jahr 2007 8 937 zimmer in 53 hotels damit setzen wir neue ma st be
958682 wir suchen neue projekte in erster linie in dynamischen m rkten die von weltwirtschaftlichen unsicherheiten nicht so sehr betroffen sind
958683 in diesen zentren ist die nachfrage nach hotels im mittleren und oberen segment hoch und internationale marken sind kaum vertreten
958684 rtliche gegebenheiten in aufstrebenden m rkten k nnen unter umst nden dazu f hren dass wir wie jeder unserer mitbewerber mit verz gerungen bei hoteler ffnungen rechnen m ssen
958685 um dies auszugleichen und um unser risiko im rahmen zu halten wachsen wir parallel nat rlich auch in nord und westeuropa zudem w hlen wir erfahrene gesch ftspartner mit solidem hintergrund aus
958686 wir haben in skandinavien begonnen und dann ber europa neue m rkte wie den nahen osten sowie afrika erreicht dabei sind wir stets einer soliden strategie gefolgt niemals dem blo en zufall

958693 ich verstehe nicht warum 15 liter spritverbrauch pro 100 kilometer bei einem gel ndewagen als dienstkraftfahrzeug steuerlich abgesetzt werden k nnen wenn der halter ein solches auto f r seine beruflichen t tigkeiten nicht braucht
958694 wer so eine spritschleuder unbedingt fahren will soll das von mir aus tun aber nicht auf kosten der brigen steuerzahler
958695 wer wie herr huber und die csu in bayern nur die wiedereinf hrung der pendlerpauschale ab dem ersten kilometer fordert gibt leuten wie mir mit hohem einkommen eine noch h here pendlerpauschale
958696 mein nachbar hingegen der im tiefbau arbeitet kinder hat und nicht sehr viel verdient bek me weiterhin gar nichts unsere wegekosten sind aber gleich und f r ihn sogar eine weit h here belastung das ist doch alles in hohem ma e ungerecht
958697 bei der pendlerpauschale ist der zuspruch f r die csu aus der cdu enorm gro
958698 die kosten sollten ber den abbau kologisch unsinniger subventionen gegenfinanziert werden
958699 unsere eltern sind auch irgendwann der arbeit nachgezogen und haben vom staat nicht verlangt dass er eine t gliche heimfahrt von mehr als 200 kilometern subventioniert
958700 wer wie herr huber und die csu in bayern nur die wiedereinf hrung der pendlerpauschale ab dem ersten kilometer fordert gibt leuten wie mir mit hohem einkommen eine noch h here pendlerpauschale

958707 one of the oldest motor racing phrases ever coined is to finish first first you have to finish hackneyed it may be but its true nonetheless
958708 even so you have to feel sorry for felipe who did a very good job
958709 but heikki drove superbly scoring his first grand prix victory in fine style and converting his excellent qualifying pace which has been apparent all season into a thoroughly well deserved win

958712 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
958713 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
958714 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
958715 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
958716 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
958717 a city really none of us were comfortable walking in the streets to one that was basically safe

958725 there was a lot of shouting and pushing people fell down and could not get up they just suffocated
958726 the police did not allow people to step back meanwhile people started coming down from above shouting go back go back
958727 since the police did not allow the people to go back this tragedy happened
958728 it takes time and privacy especially working out the methods which i wouldnt have guessed anyone really knew in the lab at that time
958729 the changes really began to accelerate in the last year he would sit at his desk weeping
958730 he really couldnt do his work any more the pressure was tremendous
958731 people given these kinds of responsibilities with this kind of power at their fingertips we have to make sure that they are not likely to do harm to others or misuse that authority be it intentionally or be it because of some mental problem
958732 these kinds of situations cry out for reexamination of our standards
958733 youre basically going to scare off any scientist from wanting to work in this field if it becomes even more stringent
958734 it is a balance its a policy decision about how stringent we want to be

958794 i happen to have been privileged enough to be in on the fact that weve been visited on this planet and the ufo phenomena is real
958795 this is really starting to open up i think were headed for real disclosure and some serious organisations are moving in that direction
958796 i thought id stumbled on some sort of astronaut humour but he was absolutely serious that aliens are definitely out there and theres no debating it
958797 on 8 january 1996 at about 4 in the afternoon as the artists of banadir star band of which i was a member were in the middle of performing a concert attended by well over 600 hundred audience at a basketball stadium near the eastern police station in north mogadishu we saw hundreds of the islamic court militia forcing their way into the stadium at the time at least three songs had been performed a short comedy acted and the next song was in progress all of a sudden the venue became full of armed militias to the extent that they outnumbered the audience shortly one of the most senior officials of the court dressed with ankle length white unfitted gown with long sleeves and a head shawl waving a long whip in his hand entered the stadium i recognised him very well as sheik abdi ali alasow the deputy chairman of the islamic court immediately sheik abdi began whipping the artists as his militia fired into the air throwing and breaking our instruments dispersing and chasing the audience who for fear of their lives were already pushing their way to the main gate or jumping over the walls as a result of the stampede that followed some of the audience sustained fatal injuries sheik abdi and his militia shouting out you represent evil and have been corrupting the morals of the muslims herded us to one place and then divided us into two groups of men and women they took all our instruments in a vehicle before the courts militia armed with ak47 rifles and whips herded us out of the stadium to the eastern police station in the same neighbourhood upon arrival they imprisoned the men in a small dark and dirty room while we the women were taken to another prison the former beder warehouses that the court turned into a prison situated near the football stadium sportivo conis stadium in abdul aziz district in north mogadishu in total we were seven women and they crammed us all into one dark room and left us there without food and water
958798 the next day on 9 january at about 1 00 pm the courts militia brought us back to the eastern police station there we joined the male artists who were trembling in the dirt with anguish and we were all told to wait there for a trial by the court judges soon a group of judges sat in upholstered dining chairs in a semi circle before us they held copies of the koran in their hands and began deliberating on our case sometimes they were arguing each other exchanging heated words without even speaking to us or giving us a chance to speak for ourselves both the chairman of the court and his deputy were among the judges few minutes after they ordered us to sign statements in which we denounced music and declared that we would never be involved in it hereafter after that sheikh ali dhere stood up and announced the official court verdict he said that after consulting the koran we were found guilty for deviating and corrupting the morals of fellow muslims and that in consequence and as punishment the court sentenced us to 20 lashes each
958799 at about 1 30 am the horrible event began with the male artists being the first to be lashed one by one as the lashing began in full gear the number of spectators increased certainly some of them must have been crying inside when they saw the blood of their beloved artists dripping from their bodies and heard them moaning in pain while others believed that we were paying the price for our crimes when it was my turn two strong men took turns to flog me to avoid getting tired of the lashing exercise the clerics were taking turns one of them was sheik abdi ali alasow the deputy chairman of the islamic court who also led the court militia that arrested us and confiscated our instruments the previous day but this sheik also gave me one extra lash he told me that having been a young woman whose music was widely admired nationwide he personally decided to give me one extra lash the square was surrounded and guarded by heavily armed militia with their fingers on the triggers of their kalashnikov assault rifles therefore no one could even think about running away or making any suspicious movements during the lashings not even khadra aweys who was 14 an actress and the youngest in the band was spared by the clerics from being lashed like us two strong men took turns in flogging her the women artists convicted by the islamic court were seven in total the court clerics spared four of them from being lashed after they had claimed before the public that they were pregnant and in fact no more evidences were needed to substantiate their claims as their pregnancies were quite noticeable maryan abdule gesey actress folklore dancer and comedian experienced the worst from the lashing the clerics hit her two times on the breast she fell and cried out in pain that finally knocked her unconscious she feared that she would die on the spot luckily she did not die in the square but suffered from that experience for years afterwards
958800 when the last person was flogged the clerics told us to go home at a time when we were not able to make any movements with our limps our clothes were full of blood some of the spectators and our relatives helped us to get home
958801 i was among friends and relatives who tried to relieve ms shukri of the pain and later visited her in her house

958810 as violence and fighting in somalia escalates both the somali musicians and print media journalists face a pure targeted double killing
958811 first the islamists prevented them from making a living by practicing their professional artistic or journalistic skills now it seems that they cannot feel safe even if they leave their professional skills and change over to work in other capacities
958812 not only the music but also the print media is disappearing in somalia while their preferred replacements such as the fm radios and their mushrooming associated websites are at least enjoying the protection of their politically influential owners as well as their respective clan militias

958818 door over verschillende oplossingsstrategie n na te denken reflectie en erover te praten moet de leerling tot begrip komen critici vinden dit de waanzin ten top verhaaltjes dwingen tot lezen niet tot rekenen en kinderen raken alleen maar verward door de verschillende strategie n

958820 war made easy how presidents and pundits keep spinning us to death
958821 for blacks jim crow america meant not simply white people not wanting to be around them it meant a concerted effort to restrict the creation of wealth redlining wasnt just offering a racial preference to whites indeed it actually punished whites for living around black people it was a government conceived and sponsored effort to devalue the homes of black people thus draining what little wealth there was in the communities when post slavery southern and midwestern blacks following booker ts conservative line created wealth by working the land and building their own businesses white terrorists violently undermined their efforts at every turn while the government refused to do its most basic job protecting its citizens
958822 conservatives often chastise liberals often rightly for social engineering but its hard to deny that the root of racial inequality was a massive system of social engineering itself meant to economically advantage whites though the most malicious elements of that system have been dismantled inequalities persist generation to generation partially because of prior meddling these long term effects are what make social engineering so dangerous in the first place
958823 there was a point in my life when affirmative action would have meant something to me when my family was working class and we were struggling but very early in life i became part of the majority culture and now dont think of myself as a minority yet the university said i was one anybody who has met a real minority in the economic sense not the numerical sense would understand how ridiculous it is to describe a young man who is already at the university already well into his studies in italian and english renaissance literature as a minority affirmative action ignores our societys real minorities members of the disadvantaged classes no matter what their race
958824 war made easy how presidents and pundits keep spinning us to death

958836 hundreds of our brothers who were killed by the police without the assassins ever being worried
958837 they should be heard and understood i wrote the article three years before the explosion in the cite ghettoes in 2005
958838 nowadays this kind of police violence is becoming commonplace and its getting more and more worrying in the last week there were three murders theres a feeling of impunity on the ground the people responsible for this violence remain untroubled
958839 the debate during this trial went to the heart of the matter all that i wrote in that fanzine six years ago has been amplified nowadays and we did our best to add testimonies that support my analysis
958840 when a policeman kills he must be tried if he abuses his authority he must be punished and the same justice must be used to chastise him in the same way as any citizen this is the very cement of our society its just so obvious
958841 the accuracy of what ham wrote six years ago has been underscored by the 2005 rioting so he cannot be indicted all that he wrote has been proven right on the ground
958842 im optimistic that he will again be discharged its been a political trial from the start its not my fault if the signature at the bottom of the complaint is that of nicolas sarkozy unfortunately for him however every time politics enters a courtroom justice triumphs
958843 expressing psychological emotions is not forbidden by law i believe every individual has that right people think its an aggressive subculture for youth who cut their veins every day first and foremost emo is not a culture of the soul but of music
958844 dream of every emo is to die in a warm bath from the blood of cutting their wrists
958845 this type of behavior is a crucial part of emo ideology
958846 of course there are emo teens who just listen to their music but our actions are not directed at them but rather at those who also hurt themselves commit suicide and promote those acts
958847 suicide is not a symptom of emo culture i work with other teens too and every group has emotionally troubled kids
958848 many subcultures can in fact help children mature into adults
958849 many kids seek those with the same perspective and problems and through this they can enter general society

958901 its a fine mess weve gotten ourselves into now isnt it
958902 this is going to make it extraordinarily difficult for whoevers going to become president i dont care who the president is
958903 the government has known for decades that america is on a countdown to self destruction
958904 the object of the research was the development of a plausible vision of the future in which democratic methods survive major problems are managed successfully if not resolved and the unfolding of the human potential continues to expand
958905 those who should get in get in those who should be kept out are kept out and those who should not be here will be required to leave
958906 the thing about this research is that this work has confirmed that our economy based on parasitic capitalism where the small elite sits atop the heap of men and gorges on their lifeblood is destroying the social fabric of america
958907 this system is based on a stacked deck where the top elites always reap the profits that are made to rise to the top through the corporate profits based system
958908 the research confirmed that the rowing inequities of such a system were ever increasing and with them elevated social tensions
958909 despite all the reports shortcomings and its hypocrisy it does make some sound observations about what is needed for our immediate survival we should take it as a guide to what our government knows about the coming mega crisis and a template to help us see what changes we could make if there were truly a new economy a new social contract a new american state for it is obvious to all those who take the time to look that we are headed into a period of national freefall when american society plunges head first into a dark abyss of uncertainty as the old order passes away and the new world order rushes in to fill the void we are seeing the planned collapse of america coming down the road we are on what are we going to do to get our nation off that highway to hell
958910 if you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the result of a hundred battles if you know yourself but not the enemy for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat if you know neither the enemy nor yourself you will succumb in every battle
958911 sun tzu was well aware that combat involves a great deal more than the collision of armed men numbers alone he said confer no advantage he considered the moral intellectual and circumstantial elements of war to be more important than the physical and cautioned kings and commanders not to place reliance on sheer military power
958912 whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy will be fresh for the fight whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted

958919 colleagues and friends of the vaccine specialist remained convinced that ivins was innocent they contended that he had neither the motive nor the means to create the fine lethal powder that was sent by mail to news outlets and congressional offices in the late summer and fall of 2001
958920 usamriid doesnt deal with powdered anthrax i dont think theres anyone there who would have the foggiest idea how to do it you would need to have the opportunity the capability and the motivation and he didnt possess any of those

958924 it was now december 2001 yet dolan and altimaris hartford courant story was the first i had heard of the quantico letter supervisory special agent james r fitzgerald had not heard of it either in fact there were quite a few critical documents that fitzgerald had not yet seen what i wondered has the anthrax task force been doing hoping that the quantico letter might lead if not to the killer at least to a suspect i offered to examine the document my photocopy arrived by fedex not from the task force but from fbi headquarters in washington searching through documents by some 40 usamriid employees i found writings by a female officer that looked like a perfect match i wrote a detailed report on the evidence but the anthrax task force declined to follow through the quantico letter had already been declared a hoax and zero filed as part of the 9 11 investigation

958975 the new stadium is wonderful its top class i wish i had played in such a stadium during my heyday
958976 on 3 may 2006 a day after orlando stadium celebrated its 47th anniversary we stood at almost this exact spot when we handed her the old lady to the contractors on that day we marked the city of johannesburgs ground breaking movement towards the first 2010 project to be initiated by the city
958977 when we announced that orlando stadium would be demolished and reconstructed we had a vision of what the new stadium would look like and what it would mean to the community of greater orlando
958978 orlando stadium will be completed on time within budget and without compromising quality as per the commitment we made when we handed it over to the developers in may 2006 the stadium will be complete by november 2008
958979 the community at large has benefited from this development through the jobs that have been created
958980 to date 2 205 jobs have been created and training is being provided in the fields of carpentry bricklaying plastering and painting
958981 the contractors have done a tremendous job and need to be commended the whole stadium gobbled up 28 000m of concrete and 60 000 tonnes of steel
958982 the bus rapid transit brt system will run to the east of the stadium and rail transport will complement the brt on the western side public parking facilities will also be constructed around the stadium
958983 i hope to play in the middle of the park like i used to do
958984 the past two years has seen the event grow to involve both soweto teams and teams from outside the township
958985 women are normally associated with being the pillars of strength in their households but with the help of philips and safa soweto women are now also being recognised as stars on the sports field
958986 the teams have been divided into two streams of four teams each the top teams in each group will go through to the finals while the second best teams will battle for third and fourth place
958987 jamies trained all week and hes looked quick and sprightly
958988 eventually our plans are for the achievement system to become an account based system
958989 for now the points are just a wow character score as we graduate to that blizzard account system which is right on the horizon it will switch over to a blizzard level rather than call it a score we just wanted it to be like youre levelling up on blizzard games
958990 things like i have a horde and alliance character at maximum level or i have three max level characters
958991 the whole reason we went out and acquired the licence and that we now own fallout is that we clearly intended to make more than one
958992 this is not something were going to do once and then go away and never do it again
958993 when that will be or how long that will be god only knows but we acquired it specifically because we wanted to own it and develop it and work on it like we do with the elder scrolls
958994 i wouldnt have wanted to take over the reins in these particular circumstances

958996 work is ongoing on a welsh language lco and in late autumn hopefully will be brought forward
958997 we know that the stadium will see some action but there is some hope that there will be another activity coming to wales but that is something we have to fight our corner on
958998 im very concerned about the effect of the london olympics on the level of grants that is available both for cultural activities and sporting activities in wales but of course throughout the length and breadth of britain
958999 it certainly has created problems if we believe that sporting activity should be promoted more widely in communities then you have to put the money in
959000 if money is taken out then to promote one activity in one specific area then i think that is wrong
959001 i hope tina forgives david i havent filmed those scenes yet but hopefully she can we dont know yet well have to wait and see
959002 its a bit of curiosity and theres a bit of trust issues going on as well shes been emailing her ex matt a lot but she just sees it as a friendship in the email she says she wants david to be a bit more spontaneous and the sort of gigs she likes and david turns up with tickets to exactly the same gig and he starts being a bit more spontaneous a bit more loving towards her she thinks its lovely at first then obviously it clicks she does dump david she thinks whats the point if he cant trust her she feels a bit violated that hes done that to her

959010 there are a lot of resources out there but there has to be quality control
959011 what were trying to do is take the burden away from the schools so they can focus on teaching and learning
959012 the idea is to build an edumall which is evaluated by its users so that good resources will be highlighted
959013 resources that arent so useful will sink to the bottom of the pile and can be removed as necessary
959014 as edumall grows its going to be very big and this is how people like to work online they want things to be personalised they want to talk to other people to have a home online and the personal space provides that
959015 independent learning for instance students dont always have to go through the teacher
959016 we talk a lot about remedial and enrichment work and it takes a lot of time not only for the teacher but also for students

959022 when i first began using the term attachment parenting nearly 20 years ago i felt ridiculous giving a name to a style of baby care that parents would naturally practice if they followed their own intuition rather than listening to the advice of others
959023 i want baby cows to be taken away from their mamas so i can have their milk
959024 without embracing compassion for my son i would never have moved my sphere of compassion beyond our family and beyond the human family
959025 in every single interaction i have with my son i try to see where he is coming from and what he might be thinking and feeling before i decide what the best course of action is and its the same with veganism i think about the cows and how it would have felt to have my baby taken away from me at birth and then forced to pump milk for however many hours a day have mastitis live in cramped quarters etc etc
959026 the connection i see between veg nism and ap is simply considering things from the side of the other if my baby cries she would prefer to be soothed than left alone so i soothe her if an animal doesnt want to be eaten or commodified which s he doesnt im going to respect that too

959052 doctors are duty bound if they see one of their colleagues doing something untoward to report it mr robertson said
959053 what has happened in this case is that over a two year period between 2004 and 2006 this individual has been allowed on occasion to operate without appropriate supervision mr robertson said
959054 that was a result of a breakdown of communication between the college of surgeons the medical board and indeed queensland health
959055 what this report suggests is that a critical lack of communication between industry and government agencies is putting patients lives at risk mr langbroek said in a statement
959056 the fact that a doctor with serious question marks over his head as to his clinical capability was allowed to operate without any supervision is beyond belief in this post patel era

959060 open in quotes and his calling on all european citizens to protest to their local big evil record company does come across as a rather thinly veiled attempt to deflect the criticism that certain countries have directed towards apple on the issue but overall really encouraging

959062 construction of a border fence has impacts to fish and wildlife resources that could not adequately be compensated for by the offer of compensation
959063 its obvious that where the wall goes wildlife and habitat will be affected
959064 the government is looking at this as a piece of dirt and not as a whole ecosystem
959065 we understand the reasons that the federal government believes they need to build this fence and were certainly not in a position to make a decision whether thats right or wrong
959066 but from the texas parks and wildlife departments point of view and for us as commissioners our job is to look at the mission of texas parks and wildlife and our constituency which is the citizens of the state of texas and decide whats the right thing relative to our mission what we at texas parks and wildlife are supposed to do and not do

959079 hes getting better and is working with a fitness coach back at the training ground i hope he will be ready to start training next week but he will not play until he is in good condition
959080 if youre talking about someone to take on both jobs then kevin pietersen becomes the number one candidate because hes one of the few people who can be guaranteed their place in both teams
959081 michael vaughans decision is his own decision but i cant believe that paul collingwood made that decision off his own back
959082 clearly they want to unite the job and get one bloke in there and theyve given paul a gentle nudge to say that this is in the best interests of the team
959083 hes been a wonderfully successful captain englands most successful in terms of test match wins and is surely one of englands greatest ever captains
959084 in terms of playing captaining leading decision making michael vaughan is the best man for the job
959085 its a wonderful job but its also a job that becomes all consuming he said hes not been himself at home and wanted to get back to being me
959086 the job gets on top of you its a great job but youre thinking about it all the time

959097 theft is always a consideration when you are working with adolescents cash high value food and some employees earning near the minimum wage

959109 president bush has been working with the iraqis to encourage them to work out their differences and get the provincial elections law passed
959110 the fact that virginia is even up for grabs tells you a lot
959111 if you had told me four years ago that a democratic presidential candidate would be running a competitive race in virginia and would open 10 offices i would say that is spectacular
959112 now we have a guy who has opened 20 to 30 offices around the state youve got to be kidding me
959113 we have traditionally been the party who can get their people to the polls when its a presidential race
959114 even in 1996 when bill clinton was winning every state imaginable bob dole won virginia because our people showed up
959115 the challenge hamdan v rumsfeld and the fight over presidential power
959116 the generic problem is the question of why people having useful knowledge cant be bribed to reveal it
959117 if you have to spend your life reading the talmud you are not very good at software

959120 we have all tribes on the team and there is no problem
959121 i felt like a piece of me had gone missing it was like i was split in two
959122 i was kind of stuck in a repetitive thinking about the suffering that she went through in the last month of her life and the last few weeks
959123 i just kept reliving that over and over again in my mind
959124 i think it has very important implications for how grief is conceptualized and how it is treated
959125 this shows that theres actually a difference in the brains of people who have the syndrome compared to the ones who dont
959126 some people are still confused by the fact that it does resemble regular grief
959127 i wanted to know if there is something different in the brain when people are processing their grief in those who are adapting well and those who are not adapting well
959128 the question was are their brains processing their grief differently
959129 is the living memory of a nation it sustains within itself and safeguards a nations bygone history

959137 this is not the old crying wolf kind of stuff
959138 it is time for new york and other governments to cut up our credit cards the era of buy now and pay later and later is over
959139 even back in the old days there was a screening process for people who work in those laboratories
959140 there are time honored procedures to examine security clearances on a regular basis to verify information provided by the security clearance holder and traditional steps to ensure that only the appropriate level of security access is granted largely based on the nature of the persons government job
959141 some insurers can make a decision in the same day or right on the spot
959142 as health care moves into the digital age there are more and more companies holding vast amounts of patients health information
959143 most people dont even know these organizations exist unfortunately the federal health privacy rule does not cover many of them the lack of transparency with how all of this works is disturbing
959144 why has the united states been able to hold an olympics three times because it is a strong country now we are the host it is a sign of state power
959145 the large star represents the communist party and the other four stars form a semicircle around it
959146 economically its not feasible to have the type of purses necessary to run
959147 simulcasting revenue will allow us to meet our debts and pay our bills
959148 this is another sad day for maryland racing without rosecroft we need that slots referendum we have to realize how close we are to losing everything without the referendum there is no rosecroft and thoroughbred racing will be what charles town was 20 years ago racing donkeys almost all of our proud history is almost out the windows all it will be is memories
959149 anything we can do to bring harness racing back sooner im for
959150 the track would have to be redesigned but the meadowlands handles both standardbreds and thoroughbreds on the same track if someone says we could have thoroughbred racing at rosecroft by next summer and the harness races could be back in the fall but this is just the first step it would take a lot of cooperation

959159 i told my kids im going to iraq to play army
959160 whilst there were resilient performances in asia in particular even growth here is likely to lose a little momentum in the nearer term
959161 reasonably well albeit with less momentum than in the recent past
959162 ultimately the real economy will recover from this crisis although it may get worse before it gets better
959163 the bad stuff has been purged through the system were essentially exposed now to the u s economy and it would be a brave person who sees an upturn in the u s economy in the second half of this year
959164 there can be no prospect of a fundamental recovery in this business
959165 the first half of 2008 saw the most difficult financial markets for several decades marked by significant declines in profitability throughout much of our industry
959166 the continuing strength in the retail businesses in the developing markets
959167 we should be aware that the credit crisis is not behind us yet
959168 the main risks are execution risk in the solvency rebuilding plan the integration of the abn acquisition and market risk
959169 we think the bulk of the effort in the coming months is going to come from the divestment of non core assets we have identified the list we have appointed investment bankers
959170 i consider it crucial to strengthen the communication with our stakeholders and will update the market in full transparency on progress made
959171 we are taking these steps because we want to reinforce the tremendous importance of workouts and reward their use
959172 they want to provide the servicers the financial support to continue to conduct the loss mitigation efforts
959173 the stock market is down because oil went back up
959174 we have more market tension with oil than with the employment report
959175 add up the scorecard and it says the economy is neither collapsing nor recovering rapidly
959176 the employment data was ok when compared to what some people had feared but does reiterate that the economy is certainly in a jobs recession
959177 oh we dont need a toilet bowl brush pouring clorox in will make it very clean already
959178 crucially in our view cask has clearly outperformed the beer sector in on sales in 2007 cask ale is doing better than ale overall and a lot better than total beer
959179 we nielsen agree with siba that cask ale accounts for a much higher proportion of ale sales in pubs possibly nearer 30 40 per cent in outlets stocking it maybe 50 per cent plus in regional brewers pubs though many city and town circuit bars and clubs dont stock cask at all but where stocked cask is often a large part of the beer mix
959180 recovered very well in the market given the non summer of 2007 and the effect of the smoking bans in england wales and scotland
959181 it was close to growth again but this may have been hit in recent months as the gb on sales beer market was down 8 9 per cent at may 2008
959182 given june and july 2007 beer market figures were poor cask ale may even do relatively better still in summer 2008
959183 supported by retailers keen to give choice variety and source local products
959184 looking at beer trends in general in 2008 id have to caution that cask ales move to growth may well be scuppered by current economic woes and smoking ban effects let alone duty hikes that said i suspect cask to continue to outperform beer in general in 2008
959185 are clearly growing or doing better than a declining beer market so growing their share
959186 as a matter of routine practice whenever we identify a risk area we incorporate it into our oversight of firms

959221 youd rather lose a game by trying to play exciting expansive stuff rather than have everyone falling asleep at the stoop
959222 weve changed how we play its a lot more expansive and we use the ball a lot more the by product of that is you make errors and you let the opposition back in and end up on a rollercoaster ride sometimes

959302 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit

959459 jika pelaku beriktikad itu memberikan kemanfaatan kepada keamanan kedamaian ruh mereka yang telah meninggal dunia maka itu adalah perbuatan syirik yang jelas akidah islam menentang sebarang unsur keberhalaan

959533 we dont have to be jealous of the cornfields of iowa
959534 and when we eat its very poorly because our situation is very difficult here and i can tell you this we and our children and our grandchildren will have to eat each other when were hungry
959535 twenty years ago the international institutions told us that there was no sense you know in producing grain

959546 when we go overseas now a dollar denominated price is something much more competitive if you are competing against companies that are selling in euros for instance

959562 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
959563 i think its important for the american people to understand were not going to drill our way out of this problem
959564 its also important to recognize if you start drilling now you wont see a drop of oil for ten years which means its not going to have a significant impact on short term prices every expert agrees on that
959565 the higher cost of these healthier foods isnt necessarily prohibitive either

959574 it is perhaps an overbold beginning but i will venture to say that with its preaching christianity stands or falls the christian preacher is not the successor of the greek orator but of the hebrew prophet the orator comes with inspiration the prophet comes with a revelation
959575 it provides a hint of the plot to audiences who might be skeptical of what is to them a foreign film

959577 henbane is a very toxic plant and should never be eaten

959588 aici intrebarea nu este cati oameni au acces la internet ci cati oameni se informeaza pentru ca unul a avut acces la internet
959589 guvernul cubanez stie ca avem internet la negru la fel cum stie ca luam mancare de pe piata neagra ca sa putem trai

959595 whilst there were resilient performances in asia in particular even growth here is likely to lose a little momentum in the nearer term

959602 hes already carried this thing out too far its kind of a joke
959603 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
959604 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
959605 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
959606 i dont know how this will be resolved yet i do know if i am going to play this year i need to get in camp i would love to play again everyone says brett go play my question is where
959607 when i retire the packers lose all marketing rights they cannot sell anything with my name on it thats a big deal to them its just like an endorsement with nike we have been working on that deal for some time
959608 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate
959609 well there comes time when my mentor and i get to compete and i guess thats whats going to happen

959684 we did not get what we expected in the first race but we did a really good second race as a team with both riders on the podium
959685 we made the wrong tyre choice for both riders on the first one so in race two one rider went softer and the other one harder obviously each choice was a good one
959686 i am happy to take a second place in race two because in the first race my rear tyre choice was not so good and i was disappointed with that
959687 in the second race i just changed the rear tyre and i had a good feeling with that one i had a good battle with kiyo but he was faster than me in some places then i would catch him up congratulations to kiyo and also my team because they made a good job to allow me to finish second
959688 race two was better than the first race we made some changes to the tyre choice and the bike and they worked well
959689 i just could not run the pace of the guys at the front because they just pulled away i had a bit of a battle with bayliss and it took a bit of time for me to get past him but i am content with third im out there trying to win races but podiums will have to do for now

959768 una posible soluci n es el desarrollo de ant dotos frente a venenos de serpientes de cada regi n pero una estrategia m s simple y econ mica es la producci n de antisueros frente a una mezcla de venenos colectados de diferentes espec menes

959774 los terrenos aeroportuarios es decir aquellos que s disponen de declaraci n de impacto ambiental elaborada por el ministerio son los publicados en el boe y ellos finalizan en la cv 145
959775 es precisamente aqu donde acaban las competencias del ministerio y empiezan las de conselleria en los terrenos que no pertenecen al aeropuerto y no tienen dia
959776 por si alguien dudaba de la inexistencia de declaraci n de impacto ambiental a partir de la cv 145 demuestra al ejercer sus competencias m s all de dicha carretera que en los terrenos contiguos a los se alados en la dial publicados en el boe por el ministerio no existe estudio medioambiental alguno y por tanto que se ha estado actuando al margen de la ley

959790 doubleclick would not mention which publishers are using the exchange but there are 35 combined publishers and advertisers currently using the service
959791 the google toolbar watches everything users do online in real time
959792 look at what google can do with mobile phones see every contact people dial track and serve what ads they see its clear their intent is to have all search and advertising run through their toolset from google adwords and customer acquisition through the final google checkout transaction
959793 android can take awy all search and advertising revenue streams from mobile operators who have the opportunity to become one of the most sophisticated and targeted ad networks on the planet
959794 we want to make it possible for you to find video every time you want it and its hard to solve this problem
959795 the lines between search discovery and browse are a little fuzzy
959796 goes to all key places including media companies and major content producers
959797 if we had been out in front then it perhaps would have been a little bit different
959798 but hungary showed they had some really strong pace which we already knew they had its just you guys the media seem to think theres a huge difference
959799 i think i drove well i didnt make any mistakes i just had a puncture i brought the car home as safe as possible and scored as many points as i could so theres not much more you can ask for
959800 its just unfortunate i was the one to get a puncture and it was a case of oh no not again i had it three times last year or whatever it was and thats what really lost me the championship
959801 it can be very very costly but kimi didnt win and it actually helps heikki has won and glock was second they are taking points off everyone else so im quite happy
959802 my lead is bigger now and you would never have thought that with all that has gone on this year
959803 im going to make sure i work very hard and that physically i am well prepared for the rest of the season
959804 im going to make sure we keep up with the performance we have and i think youve seen that here
959805 in the second stint i was quite a bit heavier than felipe and i was keeping up with him and catching him sometimes i think i showed pretty good pace this weekend that i still continue to have the strong pace that i have in races
959806 i think me and felipe were the quickest out there and so its still good to have that
959807 i had one of my best ever starts but felipe had an even better one
959808 i think any team would want to have a longer term deal any driver for one year is difficult
959809 but if you have one year and do well then it becomes two years and three years it depends how well you do i am sure the mclaren deal was more than a one year deal and that didnt last beyond a year
959810 and i think every team apart from one in the pitlane would welcome him we are no different but whether it happens who knows
