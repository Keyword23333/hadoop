5250002 how moral is it that over the past 8 years the rich have gotten most of the economic rewards and tax breaks

5250005 it was their best ever placing in any international regatta the silver medal goes to spains iker martinez and xabier fernandez who won the title in athens four years ago and the bronze to german brothers jan peter peckolt and hannes peckolt
5250006 we sailed really well we won gold out on the water and then we had to wait in the protest room
5250007 the first two protests were dismissed sunday when deliberations on the boat change dragged into the early hours of monday the jury took a break leaving the danes not knowing if they had won the gold
5250008 the danes had an 11 point lead in overall points after 12 races over italian brothers pietro sibello and gianfranco sibello with australian world champions nathan outteridge and ben austin third overall
5250009 right when the mast broke i thought it was all over
5250010 he asked if i had the number of the danish team i did
5250011 it was just by chance that it was the croatian boat they used
5250012 we saw they broke the mast the journalist called we ran down and started to rig the boat
5250013 ibsen said the time between the mast breaking and them setting off in the croats boat
5250014 we snapped the mast we go in we take the croatian boat
5250015 we make the start with four seconds to spare if we had been four seconds later we wouldnt have been olympic champions
5250016 the wind and the waves turned so wild that every boat in the fleet capsized at least once warrer and ibsen were fighting the weather in a boat they had never sailed
5250017 everything was different and it was set up for light winds

5250023 as i tackled him six of them came over the top of me i received a big hit to the side of my head

5250027 i know that if dad had not stood up to them they would have completely trashed the house and stolen anything they could get their hands on

5250067 meanwhile frederick was testing the softness and durability of his new carpet by sliding along it on his ass unfortunately when he got to the kitchen he realized carpeting in such a high traffic food dropping upon the floor area was a very bad and unmanly idea now he must find the manly strength to pick up that phone and call lowes to come replace the carpet with some manly tile perhaps in a nice sage green to go with his seventies esque cabinetry come on frederick you can do it
5250068 we worked hard every day but the result was as you see and its really hard to take

5250079 the word therapy comes from the greek word for nurse the patient is also a doctor and the doctor a patient as everyone concerned tries to evoke a spirit of healing that will accompany the illness

5250082 these findings are important because while genes that cause hpe have been identified the interactions among those that produce hpe are not only complex but poorly understood
5250083 this represents a first step in understanding the mechanism of that interaction
5250084 this is good evidence for what has been called the multi hit model of hpe
5250085 in this model it takes mutations in both six3 and other genes in the sonic hedgehog pathway to produce the severe pathology of hpe
5250086 sonic hedgehog is a major player in embryonic development in the brain as well as elsewhere in the body
5250087 so this new understanding of its regulation in this very limited time and place in the brain helps us understand at a molecular level some of its overall role in brain formation

5250092 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
5250093 the same old folks that brought you george w bush the same team
5250094 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5250095 respectfully im going to disagree with you on mccain and his service i think his service was honorable he deserves respect
5250096 give a real fillip to the electoral process and to the programme for ending the crisis in c te divoire
5250097 if activities are not found for the ex combatants they could be a danger for the process i am appealing to everyone to help prevent that because the micro projects will generate income for these people who have none
5250098 we are in contact with those who have been demobilized and we hope now that with these 1 000 micro projects well know what to do with them
5250099 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5250100 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5250101 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5250102 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5250103 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5250104 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5250105 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5250106 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5250107 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5250108 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5250109 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5250110 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5250111 over the next two or three quarters we expect uk gdp growth to be slightly negative or zero satisfying the conditions of technical recession
5250112 but the bigger danger of a major uk recession can and must be prevented
5250113 our central scenario envisages that uk bank rate would be cut to 4 75 in the fourth quarter of 2008 followed by an additional cut to 4 5 in the first quarter of 2009
5250114 but if the bank of englands monetary policy committee decides not to cut rates in the next three to six months growth prospects would be worse
5250115 full impact of going into a major recession as we did in the early 1990s could be avoided now
5250116 to get back to a a path of steady growth
5250117 major dislocation and major problems emerging from a deep recession
5250118 a marked slowdown in uk activity is highly likely over the next 18 months
5250119 a very sharp decrease in consumer spending growth in reaction to falling house prices and the major squeeze on household disposable incomes

5250125 the hellenic olympic committee president stopped short of making a direct accusation as to who could be behind a system of doping but said the state must crack down on the practice
5250126 i am neither a policeman nor a detective nor a judge i dont have that knowledge and i think that the time has come for the state to do something and find a solution i believe that if they want to they will find it and i believe they do want to
5250127 whoever does such things gets mixed up in such things commits suicide and when someone wants to commit suicide nobody can stop them
5250128 the 11 weightlifters who not been named publicly tested positive for methyltrienolone months before the olympics and the steroid was also found in tests on swimmer yannis drymonakos 400 meter runner dimitrios regas and sprinter tassos gousis
5250129 of course it has to be organized when there are so many cases with the same substance
5250130 supplied to the naive because someone who knows that this could lead them to death doesnt try it
5250131 the ioc is conducting a record 4 500 doping tests in beijing up from 3 600 in athens greece had hoped this year to avoid the embarrassment of four years ago when two of its brightest track stars sprinters katerina thanou and kostas kenteris missed drug tests on the eve of the athens games
5250132 as for fani it is a fact that they went after her i love fani very much it was wrong for her to allow those who fought her to be vindicated
5250133 i dont hide it at all we are the ones who are giving this right we gave the right we are paying for old sins for this reason the ioc is indeed chasing us it is a fact that they are chasing us
5250134 i dont believe that the ioc has us in its sights or is after us
5250135 if we have done what we have done we cant accuse anyone
5250136 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5250137 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5250138 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5250139 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5250140 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5250141 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5250142 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5250143 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5250144 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5250145 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5250146 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5250147 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5250148 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5250149 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5250150 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5250151 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5250152 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5250153 who are open to doing something on the production side
5250154 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5250155 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5250156 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5250157 regarding a possible newcomer on the left to support fabio grosso we are looking at the youngster at lens but lens are being too greedy
5250158 if their position is not changed within 48 hours then claude puel coach will guide us towards another player of a very high level
5250159 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5250160 then after the grammys i thought im not going to hear from this dude for the rest of my life but then i ran into him at a party he was definitely in his celebrating shoes
5250161 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5250162 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5250163 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5250164 this has been going on and on about santa cruz and other people
5250165 the more you keep on about it the more it unsettles what we are trying to achieve
5250166 i do not want to keep saying this but nobody is going to be leaving the club
5250167 we want to keep our best players be it santa cruz warnock or mccarthy and any one of a dozen players
5250168 lets dispel all this no one is leaving the club
5250169 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5250170 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5250171 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5250172 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5250173 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5250174 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5250175 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5250176 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5250177 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5250178 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5250179 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5250180 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5250181 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5250182 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5250183 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5250184 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5250185 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5250186 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5250187 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5250188 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5250189 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5250190 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5250191 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5250192 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5250193 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5250194 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5250195 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5250196 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5250197 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5250198 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5250199 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5250200 you heard from me 5 for john baptized with water but you will be baptized with the holy spirit not many days from now

5250206 i am sure this formidable combination will contribute substantially towards realising our ambition to be the leading tractor manufacturer in the global market he added
5250207 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5250208 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5250209 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5250210 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5250211 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5250212 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5250213 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5250214 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5250215 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5250216 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5250217 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5250218 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5250219 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5250220 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5250221 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5250222 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5250223 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5250224 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5250225 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5250226 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5250227 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5250228 the campaign is objecting to a statement by nbcs andrea mitchell on
5250229 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5250230 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5250231 today its four years after that incident but manisha koirala still keeps bringing that topic up she criticized even her seniors like like rekha and sridevi so whos aishwarya rai her conduct only reflects her poor personality
5250232 should not be held responsible for any untoward incident involving the actor
5250233 salman and i broke up last march but he isnt able to come to terms with it
5250234 after we broke up he would call me and talk rubbish he also suspected me of having affairs with my co stars i was linked up with everyone from abhishekh bachchan to shah rukh khan there were times when salman got physical with me luckily without leaving any marks and i would go to work as if nothing had happened
5250235 its sad that im being projected as unprofessional and calculating filmmakers who have signed me know that the only healing factor in my life is my work this is a male dominated industry and i guess it has been difficult for many to digest a woman holding her own with dignity nevertheless theres somebody up there whos with me
5250236 i swear on anything dear to me i never said that she was seeing a new guy every month i said that the media has insinuated that shes seeing different people once and for all please let me clarify that manisha and i arent the best of friends theres no love lost between us but for goodness sake i want all the viciousness and bickering to stop im pained by the fact that a war has been created for nothing at all the magazines fill their pages but think how damaging it has been for both of us you wont believe this but i feel no bitterness or resentment towards manisha in fact i hope she finds happiness soon that sense of stability may make her feel more secure and calm her down in life
5250237 if you look up at the word unprofessional you will never find it linked to my name at all talking about movies ad films or even live shows i have always been good at my work not in one place can you point out that i was unprofessional my strong undertaking to the kind of responsibility i take on is something which has been appreciated by many
5250238 aishwarya is free to see whom she wants get married have an affair khan has no business to harass her like this
5250239 today im working on my own terms and thats a great achievement for a hindi film heroine ive done great movies great roles what more can i ask for frankly which heroine after madhuri dixit can boast of a success ratio like mine
5250240 when the time is right ill surely get married right now my careers doing fine i have age on my side so whats the hurry let me enjoy a few more years of acting
5250241 the last nail on the coffin of this relationship was abhisheks mother jaya bachchans influence on karisma
5250242 see whos taken my place my own sister shes become the hottest thing in town while i was away i dont mind giving up my position as long as its still in the family but i always tell kareena not to take all this seriously its so frivolous my advice to her is to just concentrate on her career
5250243 sono sostenuti dai presidenti della russia e della francia che invitano le parti a firmare tale documento
5250244 del resto tutto il mondo paese succedevano le stesse cose con le circolari scolastiche nel mio liceo
5250245 ci vorranno misure di sicurezza extra a causa di problemi causati dai georgiani
5250246 il punto 5 autorizza le forze di pace russe a pattugliare a qualche chilometro oltre il confine osseto senza entrare nei centri urbani le truppe militari russe se ne dovranno tornare sulle posizioni del 6 agosto e poi ci penser lonu che dovr votare una risoluzione apposita di cui ancora non si sa nulla con osservatori internazionali
5250247 israele deve essere fieria dei suo militari che hanno addestrato i soldati georgiani
5250248 i have been burned amp taken too many times by all these home biz scams how do i trust again
5250249 i am absolutely convinced that my proven ystem will create massive wealth for virtually anyone regardless of your background education or even your current level of income im going to prove it
5250250 all the credit for kaho naa went to hrithik no one gave me my dues once madhuri dixit was also laughed at but she didnt allow anyone to discourage she really slogged thats why shes so humble and well behaved madhuri is my ideal i want to be like her
5250251 well i cant comment because i dont know how true the allegations are he was great towards me he was very helpful very lovable very sweet i didnt find anything wrong with him at all maybe i also command a certain respect from people and they know their limitations as well people also know that im not here because of the money or they know my background they know the difference between people and intelligence always intimidates a man but he was very friendly very warm
5250252 i was hoping to bag sooraj barjatyas next film main prem ki deewani hoon in which kareena will co star with hrithik roshan it upsets me when im bypassed for all the important assignments with hrithik especially because we have the success of kaho naa behind us amisha also feels that film makers like subhash ghai and karan johar havent taken notice of her its not because i lack talent
5250253 maybe its because i dont have a magic surname or a miss world title
5250254 all the credit for kaho naa went to hrithik no one gave me my dues
5250255 relationships in this industry are a matter of convenience when hrithik roshan became successful he found himself surrounded by a whole lot of new friends naturally old friends like me have been sidelined
5250256 the film is such a huge success so i would have definitely become a star but i dont know if i want to be labeled as just a star there is a new star every friday id rather be known as an actress and that would have not been possible if i had done kaho naa pyar hai the film was made for hrithik his dad spent five hours on every frame and close up of his whereas not even five seconds were spent on amisha there are portions in the film where she has pimples and under eye bags on her face she just doesnt look beautiful but every shot of his was a dream if i were in the film i would have definitely got a better deal but i still feel that the attention would have divided between us so im glad i didnt do the film
5250257 on the sets of abbas mustans humraaz khanna a chain smoker was blowing smoke rings while reading a book in a corner amisha who wasnt even close by got so wild that she instantly started lecturing the poor guy on the ill effects of the cancer stick a cool as cucumber akshaye just smiled through the entire attack but the tirade did achieve its purpose akshaye has vowed never to light a fag in the presence of amisha
5250258 im old enough to understand that i may not be suitable for every role thats going around i definitely wasnt suitable for koi mil gaya the role requires the girl to be older and mature hrithik is very childlike the girl has to mother him i dont think the audience would have accepted me in that role hrithik and i are a romantic pair

5250296 i will not work with kareina again because you either get along with people or you dont i believe that if you get along with people off screen you gel with them on screen i didnt have any interaction with her so i dont know i dont think i would like to do a film with kareina again because at the end of the day i want to have fun
5250297 im not denying the tension between kareena and me yet im not looking to take her on ajnabee is over and done with im fast moving ahead and ive no desire to trade insults with kareena or anyone i hate it when the press puts words in my mouth
5250298 theres too much negativity too much has been written about our problem its best for us to avoid one another i would prefer to work in surroundings where i am comfortable
5250299 the day i decide not to be with dino i will say so still people insist on linking me to my friends or every guy i am seen or working with this kind of loose talk really damages personal relationships i have always acknowledged dino as my boyfriend but now i feel it would have helped had i remained quiet about it i have nothing to hide i am not ashamed of my life i am very happy with my boyfriend and everyone i am working with knows it dino and i have our ups and downs like any other couple if a relationship is all smooth it isnt a relationship we both are there for each other always but we have both made a conscious decision to concentrate on our careers for the time being magazines insist that dino and i have split up maybe they should ask us too every second day i am linked with a different man earlier it was akshay kumar now its milind soman milinds my best friend but i am constantly linked with him
5250300 there are a lot of dusky girls in the industry today the fair light eyed beauty is the average indian mans fantasy but the youngsters love the sultry sensuous dark eyed look internationally women like jennifer lopez are the rage i have never encountered any bias due to my complexion rather it has been appreciated

5250304 diddy spent the entire time with his entourage while she was being walked around by one of his assistants
5250305 she never smiled and she kept looking over at him
5250306 wont commit to a tour schedule to promote the album
5250307 you could hear her going on and on because she was standing right behind the stage curtain
5250308 shes talking and talking meanwhile you have the entire audience waiting almost two hours for the taping to start
5250309 she leaves us waiting and everyone is sitting there complaining and then she comes out and doesnt say a word about it she didnt even say hello she got right into her script
5250310 tyra kept saying when i was a model and would hardly let them talk
5250311 she had the audience prance down the street and then release black balloons some were whining that it was so bad for the environment
5250312 it was so disorganized people fell over the press outside and almost trampled two little girls tyra was acting like it was a live sporting event instead of the most self indulgent narcissistic crap

5250320 this is probably the first description of what is happening mechanistically that contributes to the ability of cells to delay apoptosis
5250321 it provides incredible insights into how three proteins work and how they can control apoptosis
5250322 this suggests that the protein is playing basically the same role in humans as we described in mice
5250323 that was intriguing because several studies suggested that hax1 was controlled by cytokine signaling
5250324 also studies have suggested that if you overexpressed hax1 in cells the cells were protected from undergoing apoptosis
5250325 that additional window of survival is extremely important because in the body cytokines are limiting
5250326 the key observation was that hax1 was important in helping cells to survive importantly what happened to the mice we generated was remarkably similar to what happens if you remove the mitochondrial enzymes called htra2 or parl
5250327 all work and no play makes billy a dull boy

5250329 its incredible the lord has blessed us with antibodies our whole lifetime
5250330 its time to hand the torch to the next generation of young people to continue this important role of st jude in the international community
5250331 dr websters legacy is that he has highlighted the importance of the avian reservoir of influenza as it relates to human health
5250332 we now know that the avian reservoir is the initial source for all human flu he has helped the world understand that we need to keep an eye on whats going on in the animal populations and communicate with each other about those changes
5250333 richard has attended who meetings and has been accepted by the international community
5250334 our report reflects how adept st jude has become at designing and conducting even complex clinical trials for twinning through iop
5250335 this is a powerful strategy for sharing our knowledge and skills with countries that have excellent clinicians but limited resources
5250336 through twinning we can ensure delivery of state of the art therapy to children in other countries while identifying additional research opportunities
5250337 in addition to fulfilling your new years fitness resolutions and raising needed funds for the children of st jude this is also your opportunity to be a part of history by creating a new guinness world record for the most abdominal crunches done in one hour by a group
5250338 im extremely proud to lead this national campaign to benefit a very worthy cause while educating women on the importance of strengthening their core as a first step to greater fitness
5250339 st jude is an incredible research center where doctors and researchers are committed to saving the lives of children with cancer and other deadly diseases
5250340 our family is forever grateful for the courageous people at st jude and all that they do ab crunch challenge participants will be a part of a vital team supporting the hospitals life saving work and ensuring that no child is ever turned away because of a familys inability to pay
5250341 so there i was in this amazing suite just beautiful and im looking around and theres this piano the place had a grand piano and i thought huh maybe i should learn to play the piano i mean i was extremely satisfied but also devastated by the finality of it all
5250342 many reported that this was the only life they knew and it was inconceivable to do anything else
5250343 some olympians now they think if i win the gold then the world will come to my door and ill be set

5250345 should have another passion something they can use as a stress release from training and that will be there when the training is gone
5250346 at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies
5250347 but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5250348 she met lindsay in the summer of 2006 at a party in malibu
5250349 from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing
5250350 but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out
5250351 both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together
5250352 back then samantha and lindsay didnt have a physical relationship
5250353 apparently samantha acted in a paternal way towards her giving her advice and cuddles
5250354 by now lindsay was sending i love you notes to samantha and signing them lindsay ronson but telling courtenay she loved her too
5250355 courtenay would throw fits of rage writing her hundreds of angry e mails from another room in the house
5250356 the sexual attraction between them was electric though and theyd still kiss and make up
5250357 courtenay still cant understand how lindsay is now so open with samantha
5250358 every time she sees a picture of them together it kills her

5250360 were going to have a banner hanging in our student union that says we are the 2006 2007 national champions
5250361 but the only thing harder than being no 1 is staying no 1
5250362 i have no idea if we are going to reach it but we will give it our best shot
5250363 for the first three years i helped peripherally i got prizes for their events
5250364 i saw it as a program that had a lot of potential
5250365 i thought it was something we could really turn into something big
5250366 weve had some great support and some great students and it has worked out for us these past few years
5250367 what i had been told about the hospital didnt compare to what it is actually like there
5250368 talking with students from other colleges and hearing about the programs that work for them was very educational
5250369 it gives us new ideas on what we can do at our campus
5250370 if we start making it a competition we lose sight of what st jude is about
5250371 we have 16 000 people on our campus and 10 percent of them participate in the event id like to believe we can get more than that if we do our job right in promoting the hospital the money will come
5250372 all the things that i wish i had told him all the thanks the news i could still tell him the conversation goes on
5250373 surely you must have some sort of defense mechanism that enables you to look away from all that sadness or numb yourself to the horror of a dying child
5250374 we speak frequently and proudly about the medical marvels that take place within the walls of st jude
5250375 but we all know none of this could be accomplished without the love dedication and financial support of each and every volunteer partner corporate sponsor and donor it is because of you that the most gifted doctors and scientists in the world come here to do their finest work
5250376 but because they are priceless god has blessed us with an army of truly dedicated individuals who are committed to the dream of danny thomas and the mission of st jude
5250377 i know if my father were here he would want randy to have this award
5250378 i didnt have the chance to know him as well as some of you but it shows you how a good man can inspire you in just a brief time
5250379 a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves who stripped him of his clothes and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead
5250380 and many came that way and when they saw him passed by on the other side
5250381 but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him
5250382 and went to him and bound up his wounds and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him
5250383 and on the next day when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the inn keeper and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever though spendest more when i come again i will repay you
5250384 one hundred and one years ago our people began a migration to the blessed shores of these united states of america seeking the freedoms and opportunities won for us by our founding fathers
5250385 therefore we who are proud of our heritage have met in washington d
5250386 we at long long last shall take our rightful place in this community of nationalities standing proudly with our heads held high in the knowledge that we have earned the right to perpetuate the name of our heritage and maintain our reputation as unquestioned good american citizens
5250387 with these thoughts engraved in my mind and my heart i shall call upon that powerful patron st
5250388 to this preamble i hereby dedicate my life and affix my signature
5250389 help me find my way in life and i will build you a shrine
5250390 this is a fitting moment in the evolution of the growth of st jude
5250391 richard shadyac is a visionary an excellent planner and his focus his tenacity his dedication and his passion for st jude are unrelenting
5250392 i became an arkansas state trooper i married my high school sweetheart i have two wonderful children and three grandchildren
5250393 how proud he would be of all of you how proud he would be of his grandchildren singing out for alsac and how proud he would be of alsac the organization that was born in his heart and built on his faith fifty years later you are still the warriors slaying the dragons that would take children from their mothers and fathers
5250394 the metaphoric rock upon which alsac was built 50 years ago
5250395 the responsibility of alsac is herculean in scope to maintain the largest pediatric research center in the world like the inn keeper who was left with the guardianship of the suffering man we at alsac also stand guard
5250396 because we share a common background we understand the little quirks that may pop up
5250397 having gone through the same thing we know exactly what we need to do for each other to make things better
5250398 its amazing all the changes since 1998 when we were last here
5250399 show me my way in life and i will build you a shrine
5250400 non profit non sectarian charitable corporation titled alsac dedicated to the parable of the good samaritan to love and care for our neighbor regardless of color or creed
5250401 i call it the hand of god pushing williams pencil
5250402 as alsac celebrates its 50th anniversary we recognize the organizations unwavering support for st jude
5250403 we are immensely proud of the fact that no child has ever been turned away from st jude because of an inability to pay and we at alsac know that our success and the success of the hospital has been solely dependent on the kindness and generosity of our donors alsac was founded on the principle of the good samaritan we have been fortunate to know and call as friends hundreds of thousands of good hearted donors in our half century of service
5250404 thanks to the 13 chefs for their work in preparing the meals for guests and to mikey flowers who filled our space with beautiful flowers of all kinds
5250405 we raised 610 000 for the hospital and had a wonderful time going about it my thanks to the forbes family for allowing us the use of their yacht which added to the events theme
5250406 thanks to everyone that made our st jude event one very classy night to remember god bless all the people involved with st jude and god bless all the children
5250407 i see the other survivors and i know even though we shared a different time and a different era that we all have the same thing in common
5250408 we were all patients here at a place that was our last hope
5250409 for the past five years countless latin artists and singers have truly embraced the life mission of st jude by supporting the angels amp stars gala
5250410 thanks to their contribution and charitable donations they are helping us save the lives of children with deadly diseases
5250411 fedex is proud to continue increasing critical awareness and philanthropic support for st jude
5250412 by partnering with talented celebrities and community leaders we help st jude children overcome illness and triumph over disease giving them much needed hope to persevere
5250413 adam and stuart are both ranked among the top 50 players in the world and sean is making a big impact this year on the pga tour we still have two weeks before the commitment deadline and we already have one of the best fields weve ever had so we are very excited
5250414 i think its best described in the way brooklyn smiles every day how shes a beautiful vibrant outspoken 3 year old and the way shes so full of life
5250415 son go inside and up the stairs and tell mr thomas that we are ready
5250416 i was told to tell mr thomas they are ready for him
5250417 they are joining in a personal way in the lifetime dream of my husband danny thomas in doing so members are ensuring the hospitals growth and effectiveness its preeminence in the world of medicine and its stature as a symbol of hope for children in the world
5250418 in 1962 of all of you standing only this group seated would have survived acute lymphoblastic leukemia
5250419 our goal is not to get bigger but to get better
5250420 it was everything we could do to save the lives of the children stricken with cancer
5250421 i expected to see a regular hospital i was not expecting to see a wonder world we feel very humble to be a part of this
5250422 donating our estate to st jude was the best decision my husband and i have made
5250423 we are relieved to see our estate going to such a great cause
5250424 there is always something new it is a living organism and the need to be a part of it is contagious
5250425 bob bare epitomizes the commitment we all have for this great cause
5250426 we will do whatever we can to save these children
5250427 decreased levels of transforming growth factor beta and increased levels of jnk are known to be associated with the transformation of myeloid cells into leukemic cells in humans
5250428 so those findings in our lab suggest once again that n myc is linked to aml
5250429 by eliminating il 3 from the culture we were able to unmask the apoptotic effect of n myc which greatly increased cell death
5250430 proteasome inhibitors are currently being used to treat some types of cancer including multiple myelomas although many aspects of this cellular process remain poorly understood
5250431 our study sheds new light on how that process works
5250432 we wanted to determine what happens to defective heavy and light chains in plasma cells so we could get a better understanding of the molecules and channels that allow these cells to get rid of defective proteins that cant be used to make antibodies
5250433 the class of cancer drugs called proteasome inhibitors block endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation as well as the destruction of proteins from other parts of the cells and cause defective proteins to overload this system
5250434 we want to fully understand how endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation works for antibodies made by plasma cells so we can design more specific ways to block this process in myelomas
5250435 our study shows for the first time the role herp plays at the retrotranslocon
5250436 the study also describes how non glycosylated proteins are removed from the endoplasmic reticulum and disposed of this information helps to explain how the process works and how we might design ways to block it in cancer cells
5250437 the new information is important because it helps identify children who are most at risk for severe disease using easily available clinical information
5250438 this narrows down the patient population who needs to be considered for antiviral therapy which is costly and often inconvenient to receive from a childs perspective for example one treatment for rsv infection is to have the child breathe an aerosolized form of the antiviral drug ribavirin for 12 to 18 hours which is tough for the child and the parent
5250439 this finding is important because with cancer patients clinicians are used to identifying those at risk for bacterial and fungal infections based on a patient having neutropenia
5250440 we decided to analyze the course of rsv infection in children being treated for cancer to identify factors that could help us predict which ones were at highest risk for severe disease or death due to a lower respiratory tract infection with this virus
5250441 long lived cells like those in the brain arent constantly being replaced like red blood cells are
5250442 these cells must have a way to remain healthy for a long time getting rid of mitochondria that threaten the cell by making ros is one of those strategies
5250443 the fact that reticulocytes must eject their mitochondria in order to form red blood cells makes it the perfect model for studying programmed mitochondrial clearance
5250444 the identification of nix as a protein that regulates programmed mitochondrial clearance is a significant advance because of the importance of this process in the health of long lived cells like those in the heart and brain
5250445 at univision and at each of the local stations in the univision radio network we are proud of the role we play for hispanics in the united states
5250446 our work with st jude is another example of our commitment to our communities the amazing response of our staff and listeners since we started our partnership 10 years ago demonstrates the importance of the st jude message of hope
5250447 we are very fortunate to have the support from univision radio and the hispanic community to ensure that no child is ever turned away from receiving treatment because of a familys inability to pay
5250448 we want the community to know that every donation even as little as 20 a month makes a difference in saving a childs life at st jude
5250449 part of my job is to motivate people when i see this for myself i want to make sure we have a very successful radiothon
5250450 eighty five percent of every dollar received comes to the hospital thats a very high number for any charity
5250451 i saw every hallway every child and every smile as i was sharing with my listeners
5250452 it makes you feel good to know you are a part of this
5250453 russland hat ehrenvoll die aggression georgiens gegen s dossetien abgewehrt und beendet heute auf kommando des oberbefehlshabers diese mission
5250454 wir m ssen darauf bestehen dass russland sich aus dem kernland georgiens v llig zur ckzieht und ganz schnell zur ckzieht
5250455 georgien hat nat rlich einen schwerwiegenden fehler gemacht aber der fehler russlands wiegt schwerer weil russland ein unabh ngiges land angegriffen hat

5250465 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5250466 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5250467 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5250468 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5250469 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5250470 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5250471 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5250472 the honor and dignity of the country will be affected and in my view the honor of the office of president will also be affected
5250473 they succeeded in pumping the rising flood waters to the western outskirts of the village main street where there is a sufficient downward slope to allow the water to escape
5250474 the fridge will have to be replaced the washing machine tumble drier all gone
5250475 je kent me niet we zijn vrienden op hyves kom je daar nog wel eens
5250476 toen er verkiezingen zaten aan te komen zeiden mensen tegen mij jij moet ook een hyves site net als andere politici mensen hebben dat voor mij opgezet maar ik ben er zelf nooit echt mee bezig geweest eigenlijk kom ik er nooit
5250477 mijn secretaresse moest daar in het begin wel een beetje aan wennen een minister die zelf achter zijn computer kroop en ging googelen
5250478 als een gebruiker en iedere internetter kan dat doen aanstoot neemt aan een bepaald filmpje kan hij een rood vlaggetje op het scherm aanklikken de eigenaren van de website gaan dat filmpje dan bekijken als het niet door de beugel kan wordt het verwijderd
5250479 ik wil je oproepen om op deze manier zelf je verantwoordelijkheid te nemen als je op internet iets tegenkomt dat echt niet kan
5250480 rouvoet en bos verlagen de minimum stem leeftijd en hopen op meer stemmen van vrienden op hyves
5250481 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5250482 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5250483 i pray the government stops this down sliding and take the country out of this crisis
5250484 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership
5250485 no es saludable para los argentinos que los dirigentes rurales se sumen a la cabalgata deportiva de las cr ticas por la cr tica misma donde no se visualiza m s que una protesta

5250495 we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are good role models
5250496 great bands do not gain popularity develop musically or give you what you want based nowhere and residing pretty much everywhere lovvers is compromised of four ambitious nobodies that have tellingly appeared at a moment in musical history that can only described as a yawning deluded mess
5250497 lovvers are a strange mix of musics forgotten blank generation re calling the spirit of darby crashes germs the weirdness of flipper wipers style pop and the careless attitude of the replacements at one show a girl was so confused annoyed that she wrote to
5250498 having been written about or featured in most major magazines it appears the select few have largely missed the point of lovvers
5250499 we have a very exciting announcement to make this week metallicas back catalogue is now available in full on napster rock
5250500 launched a special tab on its website that lets fans register as drivers or passengers a feature then connects would be carpoolers to each other based on where they live and which show they are attending
5250501 the thing we were trying to look at is what is the thing in any given show that probably has the biggest environmental impact thats the thousands of people driving in their cars from their homes to the venue
5250502 within the industry she seems to be loved photographers say that shes the best because she transforms herself for the camera they tell me that if you want a certain look you find it with kate moss
5250503 kate moss was so different when she first arrived on the fashion scene
5250504 at the time the catwalks were filled with six foot goddesses and then suddenly along came this short pretty ordinary girl from
5250505 maybe its because shes fallen so low and fought her way back up again
5250506 shes shown a vulnerable side that people can relate to
5250507 for some particular reason she survived a scandal that i personally thought would do horrific damage to her career shes a bit like look at what he got up to but he still came back stronger than ever
5250508 i definitely havent become middle aged ive got a house and a daughter but i still like to have fun

5250511 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
5250512 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
5250513 cone of silence on saturday evening god hates isaac hayes
5250514 figuring out how to make the web pay for what it takes to produce a really good news everybodys dilemma
5250515 im the house optimist on this question i dont think everybody will make that transition successfully but i think the times will but you know i could not draw you a day by day road map to that destination
5250516 yes but i think its farther off than conventional wisdom would have it
5250517 im now in tottenham but no one can disagree with me wanting to follow my dream
5250518 if i had been laughing when i was on the bench people would say i was an idiot eric cantona never smiled but i dont know if anyone ever asked him why he didnt look happier
5250519 our spirits are high the problem for us is the international week because that kills the momentum
5250520 its not as good as if you can stay together work as a team and build for the weekend so it will be tough but its the same for every club and a lot of players are going to be away
5250521 its part and parcel of being in the top league and all clubs have to deal with it we just have to keep working hard
5250522 its a massive advantage to play at home and all the home games are all massive games the fans will be right behind us and were looking forward to the game as we are every game
5250523 were looking forward to the whole season and we can hold our heads high
5250524 abdoulaye did well theres a language barrier weve got to get through but he has played at this level for bolton
5250525 he knows the game he reads it well and hes an experienced international player those players alongside you only help you improve
5250526 leon is a great lad who works hard and never lets anything get him down playing against these players will make him stronger and a better player
5250527 i dont want the people of pakistan to slide deeper and deeper into uncertainty
5250528 for the interest of the nation i have decided to resign as president
5250529 i am not asking for anything i will let the people of pakistan decide my future
5250530 it will be accepted there is no second opinion about that
5250531 after the elections the nation wanted solutions from the new government
5250532 but the politicians could not do so a personal vendetta was started
5250533 i am confident that not a single charge can stand against me
5250534 i have not done anything for my personal gain whatever i have done i have done it for pakistan
5250535 leading pakistan is not an easy task and anyone doing it comes under a lot of criticism
5250536 in the start most pakistanis were for him and he still has some supporters especially because the new government which promised to do things differently has failed to do much in the past 100 days in power
5250537 he wanted to serve the country and to be different
5250538 he brought parliamentary reforms he brought women into the parliament
5250539 he in a way always believed in a unity of command a very centralized command which means his command in fact
5250540 this is where he went wrong and he underestimated the value of democracy
5250541 let me repeat liu xiang will not withdraw unless the pain is unbearable
5250542 everyone expected liu to do well as well as he did four years ago
5250543 we could see he wasnt quite as strong as you expect him to be
5250544 but we didnt know it was as bad as it turned out to be
5250545 after liu xiangs injury i wont bother coming back to the birds nest for more
5250546 and will encourage him to come back to the track
5250547 i think they will be disappointed but they will understand
5250548 i just came here to compete and take the gold i dont care whos on the track
5250549 rather than have hope for new technology that comes to fruition in 10 or 20 years we need technology we can implement now
5250550 this is an interim process and its off the shelf
5250551 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5250552 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed
5250553 i pray the government stops this down sliding and take the country out of this crisis
5250554 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership
5250555 freedom is just another word for nothing left to loose

5250558 wir haben einen starken kader schade dass aufhauser und korkmaz fehlen beide geh ren meiner meinung nach zum kader
5250559 ich sehe ihn in guter form dass er nachnominiert wurde ist kein problem sondern normal ich mache auch manchmal erst nach dem letzten training die aufstellung f r das spiel
5250560 es ist wichtig f r mich die spieler im training zu sehen
5250561 f r mich ist es eine normale situation ich mache diesen beruf schon seit 35 jahren
5250562 der trainer anm br ckner hat vorher gesagt wir hatten schon 25 pressekonferenzen aber noch kein einziges training jetzt freuen wir uns riesig dass es endlich losgeht

5250567 ea is a retail based company and that means theyre dealing with retailers everyday they have constant retail issues that theyre dealing with and the last thing in the world they want to do is announce that theyre going to go free to play thats not a good relationship builder with your retail sales teams
5250568 for them to actually make that announcement was huge i thought that was one of the biggest statements that ea has made in years and it just went over peoples heads
5250569 they already have invested in korea and the9 in china theyve been doing this for ages but theyve been keeping it down they built fifa online as a free mmo why would you make one of the most popular games in asia and not release it in the us
5250570 the reason they dont is because they werent going to commit ea to free to play games but finally they have i think battlefield heroes is going to be a huge hit its going to be a bit of a phenomenon i have incredible faith that ea is going to pull this off
5250571 its a whole different world you enter when you get into free to play its like the industry that weve all been missing and the second thing weve been missing is the idea of letting people pay what they want
5250572 he looks like a state trooper says tris and he also looks bad ass heres the memorial sticker for oregon freshman todd doxey who drowned a few weeks ago thanks
5250573 there are a lot of heroes out there in radio who continue to make this happen
5250574 im just so happy and surprised by all the people especially in country music whove taken st jude to heart
5250575 he put on a mask too when we had our picture taken together
5250576 im just excited to be here doing what i can to help
5250577 the artists who come here need to take what theyve learned and pass it on the type of care offered here is revolutionary
5250578 all these people took the time out of their busy schedules to come here and help the kids
5250579 i dont want people to ever forget about st jude
5250580 each year the samaritan award is given to a broadcaster or organization that exemplifies the industrys commitment to serving the public interest through the airwaves
5250581 country cares is a program that truly embodies the spirit of this award as apparent through their tireless fundraising efforts and dedication to serving the patients of st jude childrens research hospital
5250582 jim nantz has received many awards and honors in his outstanding career with cbs sports
5250583 to have the honor to present him an award that bears my name will indeed be a very special moment for me
5250584 a series of complex developmental processes must be carefully orchestrated for the eye to form correctly
5250585 one important aspect of this coordination is that retinal thickness be the same irrespective of eye size for example the mouse eye is about 5 000 times smaller than that of the elephant eye but the retinal thickness in these two species is comparable
5250586 this represents the first example of a role for a myc gene in retinal development
5250587 on the basis of our data we propose that n myc plays a central role in coordinating retinal proliferation with eye growth during development
5250588 the determination of n myc target genes during retinal development may also contribute to the current understanding of retinoblastoma progression
5250589 importantly for retinas to maintain nearly constant thickness across species that have different sizes of eyes the total number of retinal cells must change several fold
5250590 the identification of n myc as a key regulator of these processes allows us to begin to understand the coordination of complex developmental programs in the developing eye and how these processes have evolved
5250591 give thanks for the healthy kids in your life and give to those who are not
5250592 i am so proud that these buildings are joining the thanks and giving campaign to support st jude
5250593 making eagles on the tour takes on a whole new meaning with the eagles for st jude program because i know my accomplishments help st jude achieve its mission to find cures for these special children
5250594 it touches my heart to see these brave kids they have so much courage to fight it makes me feel proud every time i make an eagle and it gives me added drive and passion to play my best golf
5250595 st jude is vital in the battle against catastrophic childhood diseases and we want the world to know it it is our hope that the eagles for st jude program will increase awareness for this special place and encourage golf fans and those who support st jude to donate to this worthy cause
5250596 eagles for st jude is a wonderfully unique program that shows stanfords amazing commitment to the kids of st jude it will be thrilling to watch the eagles accumulating throughout the pga tour knowing that each one will help support st judes ground breaking research and life saving care
5250597 on behalf of the entire global stanford financial group of companies let me say how honored we are to present this check to st jude childrens research hospital
5250598 this tournament is the flagship event for stanfords global relationship with st jude and we look forward to continuing to work together to raise funds and awareness for the battle against childhood cancer we were very pleased with the success of this years tournament our first as title sponsor and to be able to present the largest donation in the history of this event is a true honor for me st jude and these incredible kids is the reason we are involved and im delighted that we can do our part to help st jude work its miracles
5250599 with our donation today and as we have for the last 22 years fedex has supported the incredibly important work being done at st jude childrens research hospital
5250600 we remain strongly committed to this great organization through our continued involvement with the stanford st jude championship and we look forward to carrying on our charitable giving on a national level through the many opportunities with our sponsorship of the fedexcup
5250601 obviously i have my own motivation to make as many eagles as possible but with the eagles for st jude program theres an even greater reward when i do so eagles for st jude allows me to share that good feeling that i have on the golf course and turn it into something truly lasting and meaningful off the golf course i feel like my accomplishments help st jude accomplish its mission to find cures for these special children
5250602 we are grateful to stanford financial group and fedex for their commitment to make this event even more successful than in years past to see a professional like vijay singh get behind our event and support it with both his time and his money is very gratifying we see the stanford st jude championship only growing and we know thats because of the sincere and long term commitment by these incredible partners
5250603 through their dedication nearly 75 000 chilis grill amp bar team members made the 2007 create a pepper to fight childhood cancer campaign a resounding success
5250604 this years campaign once again exceeded our highest expectations totaling more than 8 2 million for the patients of st jude bringing us closer to our goal of raising 50 million and making the chilis care center building we are dedicating today a reality
5250605 as we stand at the foot of the chilis care center in celebration today i want to thank chilis grill amp bar and our other partners who helped make this dream possible we are truly overwhelmed by your dedication to help st jude provide unsurpassed patient care and unparalleled scientific research and you can know that you have helped bring hope to thousands of children from around the world
5250606 the chilis care center is a significant part of our long term strategy to translate basic research at st jude into the most advanced and effective care of patients
5250607 integrating patient care and research holds the key to more rapid advances in science and medicine this new facility will help us maintain our leadership role in defining the forefront of research to advance the treatment of children with cancer and other catastrophic pediatric diseases
5250608 we can all make a difference in the lives of others im proud to help st jude i feel like im just a regular person helping out
5250609 adjacent to that building there was a walkway that was used for storage
5250610 the bottom part is broken off but the writing is intact
5250611 i didnt know whether it was a grave or just a stone or what it was
5250612 one of the main reasons my family and i support st jude is because there is always something you can do for someone else
5250613 it costs more than 1 2 million a day to run st jude so every penny counts whats really cool about st jude is that it doesnt matter about things like race religion or a familys inability to pay they are really here to help the kids and that is what is really important it is great to be able to encourage kids to learn and help other kids at the same time
5250614 showcase is a fun filled weekend of events for the whole family to enjoy it features mans best friend working to provide funds for the best friend of children in need st jude
5250615 this is truly a win win event because the thousands of out of town exhibitors also have a major impact on the memphis economy
5250616 all of the materials are provided for you and are ready to use so all we had to do was make it happen
5250617 with st jude we play our music our format isnt disrupted
5250618 even if a radio station isnt ready to put on their own radiothons
5250619 they should definitely visit another stations event to see what goes on
5250620 the people that tune you in keep us moving forward
5250621 if you go out to eat for lunch or dinner on september 24 by going to chilis you will help seriously ill children become the ultimate survivors on that day chilis restaurants nationwide will be donating all their profits to support st jude
5250622 i have to be honest i didnt know much about st jude childrens research hospital before the create a pepper to fight childhood cancer campaign in 2006
5250623 that was my first introduction to the hospital and i was real excited about the fundraiser i got involved right away in doing whatever i could to make it a success but i have to say that this year is so much more personal for me
5250624 there was a pearl like reflective glow to her eye
5250625 we looked at them wondering if this was going to be katie soon
5250626 a lot of times in children as young as katie the treatment breaks down the bones in the face
5250627 they were tactful and truthful that meant a lot we made the decision based on quality of life concerns we felt it was best for her but that didnt make it easy
5250628 even people we just briefly met they all let us know that they were there for whatever we needed
5250629 we got messages and e mails from chilis employees all over the country sending us their thoughts and prayers
5250630 thats huge thats huge when youre going through this theyve given us all the time off weve needed to take care of our family were very grateful to have that
5250631 it was a shock to see her hooked up to the iv lines and oxygen
5250632 well forget that she lost an eye we honestly forget
5250633 we joke that every time she comes home from the hospital she has a new toy
5250634 once she gets outside she loves nothing better than just running through the grass
5250635 if we find a resource to help us and we think it might help another store we share it
5250636 i think this approach will be just as effective if not more
5250637 if you take the time youll find a silent bond that unites us
5250638 they were rolled in a knot on the bed with spider elbows jerking out and in a flailing leg whacking a heel into a thin pajama clad back their breathing was short and loud and a hand came out of the mess pulling a long skein of black hair up into the light of their small window
5250639 has not been able to get access to south ossetia
5250640 access to south ossetia is a priority we have lined up teams logistics and assistance we need to have discussions in moscow to find out exactly what is the problem
5250641 we have calls from people in south ossetia who cant contact their family members its really important that we get access to assess the situation
5250642 people in georgia will need assistance for quite some time to come
5250643 when i go home to the united states i go for a month at a time because the visits are so infrequent
5250644 the adams mcguinness leadership spent nearly two decades constructing and implementing the strategy to move from revolution to reform it was clear to mcintrye that the only possible terminus of the journey would be a settlement almost entirely constructed on british terms
5250645 for historians and other journalists the writings of anthony mcintyre are an invaluable resource no future histories of the period and the process will have any credibility if they dont draw on it

5250658 ive lived here 32 years and the only other time i remember a candidate stopping by my house to talk politics was state sen pam resor whom i know
5250659 i was impressed with hayes and liked the fact hes out there meeting people and letting them know what he stands for hes personable and i may vote for him

5250664 es gibt sehr viele zeugen die wir einzeln vernehmen werden die ermittlungen laufen auf hochtouren
5250665 there is a sense of entitlement that almost seems to be inbred
5250666 die nebenbahnen ankaufspl ne des landes sind f r uns gr ne blo e rederei seit jahren verhandelt das land und nichts kommt heraus
5250667 jahrelang gibt es bereits verhandlungen zwischen land und bund ber die mariazeller und die ybbstalbahn bisher ist aber genau nichts heraus gekommen und seit jahren wird der zustand der beiden schmalspurbahnen immer kritischer
5250668 da klingt es nur mehr zynisch wenn der landesverkehrsdirektor in den medien berichtet dass alle nebenbahnen im land erhalten bleiben und im zuge des artikels gleichzeitig von 14 bereits stillgelegten nebenbahnen die rede ist
5250669 solange sich dieses verh ltnis nicht ndert wird es dem land nicht m glich sein effizient in die regionalbahnen zu investieren die vers umnisse der letzten jahre sind schlimm genug
5250670 sollte sich in der verkehrspolitik des landes tats chlich gravierendes ndern w re das nat rlich eine gro e chance dazu m sste der zust ndige lhstv gabmann den ffis aber auch finanziell jenen stellenwert beimessen der ihnen zukommt
5250671 der soziale wohnbau in wien erf llt die ihm zugeordneten aufgaben ausgezeichnet das unterstreicht nicht nur die tatsche dass es in wien im gegensatz zu anderen st dten keine wohnungsnot und keine slumbildung gibt sondern auch das laufende programm f r die errichtung von 20 000 von der stadt gef rderten sozialwohnungen bis ende des jahres 2010 die heute seitens der beiden vp politiker maier und kenesei aufgestellten behauptungen der soziale wohnbau in wien befinde sich in der krise und der langj hrige wohnungsstadtrat faymann habe ruinen hinterlassen sind nichts anderes als ein durchsichtiges besonders plumpes wahlkampfget se
5250672 wiener wohnen ist der einzige hausbesitzer in wien der den mietern die wahl der von ihnen gew nschten hausverwaltung freistellt im privaten wohnhausbereich gibt es das nicht wie es ebenso f r gemeindewohnungen aber nicht im privaten wohnhausbereich gew hlte mieterbeir te bzw mietervertrauenspersonen gibt auch ist die vergabe von gemeindewohnungen ausgepr gt transparent f hlt sich jemand benachteiligt so kann er sich an die wohnungskommission wenden
5250673 bei all ihrer bevorzugung von eigentumswohnungen sollte die vp dar ber nicht vergessen dass der soziale wohnbau in erster linie die aufgabe hat sozial schw chere zu unterst tzen und f r eine ausgewogenheit im wohnbereich zu sorgen mit dem versprechen von b rgermeister h upl auf die durch das mietengesetz vorgesehene erh hung der mieten in gemeindewohnungen vorerst bis zum jahresende zu verzichten ist dieses selbstverst ndnis der wiener sp einmal mehr unterstrichen worden im gegensatz dazu lehnt die vp den mietenstopp in privaten wohnh usern kategorisch ab was einmal mehr die doppelb digkeit dieser partei in der sozialpolitik unterstreicht
5250674 die l sung bestehender probleme wird schnell angegangen die wohnzufriedenheit der mieter von gemeindewohnungen ist jedenfalls sehr hoch dem versuch der wiener vp auch den sozialen wohnbau in wien krank zu reden wird jedenfalls so wie in der vergangenheit kein erfolg beschieden sein
5250675 so l sst er es zu dass das lkh klagenfurt durch den offenbar wildgewordenen vp klubobmann stefan tauschitz in ein schlechtes bild ger ckt werde bevor endg ltige klarheit und die fakten der wirtschaftspr fer auf dem tisch liegen u ert sich tauschitz bereits jetzt schon dass es egal sei was bei der pr fung herauskomme der kabeg chef dieter mandl m sse auf alle f lle weg so nach dem motto auch wenn dieter mandl recht habe m sse der aufdecker abgel st werden

5250677 es ist erfreulich dass nun auch die fp erkannt hat dass einzig die vp integrationspolitik propagiert die diesen namen auch verdient wir von seiten der vp wien fordern schon seit jahren eine evaluierung der deutschkurse sowie eingangstests am beginn eines deutschkurses und abschlusstests am ende des jeweiligen kurses um die lernfortschritte feststellen zu k nnen
5250678 es ist erstaunlich dass ausgerechnet die fp sich zur integrationspartei erkl rt der einzige beitrag der fp zu diesem thema war bislang rechte hetze die vp ist zudem nicht der richtige adressat h tten wir in wien das sagen g be es f r das bliche sudern von seiten der fp keinen anlass in allen vp regierten bundesl ndern gibt es bereits integrationskonzepte oder leitbilder die zeigen wie integration funktionieren kann auch das integrationspapier von platter kann als vorbild dienen wir lassen es der fp gerne zukommen wo wir das sagen haben wird integration gelebt
5250679 gerne leiten wir die kritik an der fehlgeschlagenen integrationspolitik weiter an die adresse der sp im hinblick auf eine m gliche rot blaue koalition scheint sie diesbez glich der mut verlassen zu haben die aussagen von faymann eine solche koalition nicht einzugehen haben die haltbarkeit eines jeden sp versprechens vor einer wahl
5250680 im not suppose to get taken down by a kicker
5250681 i hit it and i heard a big thump and i realized it was blocked
5250682 i picked it up and turned around and long snapper mike leach was waving me hes like come on lets go lets go so i just ran
5250683 it was my fault i had to make up for it and try to make a play for it so everything worked out
5250684 if you get the opportunity to smack him give it your best shot
5250685 ill tell you what if i did my job right that play would have never happened
5250686 i think choice jumped over our wing guy and he jumped up and tapped it out of the air he made a great play but ill take the blame completely for it
5250687 but sams play on pacman i think thats a bigger play than mine pacman was talking junk all week to us so i think one of us had to do something about it
5250688 if he doesnt make that tackle who knows what would have happened he definitely made a heads up play on that one something to tell his kids when they get older
5250689 those are all big plays i cant say which one is bigger
5250690 he made a great play too it got blocked he picked it up and he ran for a first down thats great stuff we were both just in a different situation at the time and we did the most with the opportunity that we had at the time

5250695 do we want to contemplate his power we see it in the immensity of the creation do we want to contemplate his wisdom we see it in the unchangeable order by which the incomprehensible whole is governed do we want to contemplate his munificence we see it in the abundance with which he fills the earth do we want to contemplate his mercy we see it in his not withholding that abundance even from the unthankful in fine do we want to know what god is search not the book called the scripture which any human hand might make but the scripture called the creation

5250700 and then the final chapter coming into this stadium it was just fantastic
5250701 i tried to make a little bit of a move between 13 14km and i was probably just missing a year of training to have that explosiveness at the end and the strength
5250702 id have liked to be a bit closer but to finish top eight in an olympic games for an irish person is great
5250703 i dont know what this is about in the past months i have been training on my own some of my teammates have fallen ill and it just happened they could not make it here
5250704 i dont know if i got too excited beforehand and burned off the energy before i even got there or what but i felt so sluggish i was just not in the game
5250705 i felt alright on the start and i thought i was focused but maybe i was too excited about finishing up high and getting an irish record
5250706 it just wasnt on and i havent felt like that in a long time so right now im pretty devastated
5250707 but its the olympic games and i definitely wanted to finish and keep my head up
5250708 ive been having really bad problems breathing i assumed it wouldnt affect me because i do 100m hurdles
5250709 thats the only thing i can put it down to but at the same time im not going to stand here and make excuses when i put myself out there im responsible for how i run and that was terrible
5250710 cases of this gravity must attract heavy sentences because of the deliberate criminality organisation and sophistication of their planning and the effect on the occupants this must be one of the most serious examples of conspiracy to burgle ever to come before the court considering the amounts involved little of the property has been recovered and is no doubt well hidden in the countryside or passed on for disposal you have no respect for peoples property or the law so i have no alternative but to impose severe sentences
5250711 i feel i have the right to rob the lords sirs and the ladies
5250712 i have to feed my children and if no one is helping me achieve my goal i feel i have that right

5250716 scotland have a young team with a great work ethic and players who are very keen to learn
5250717 i think they have the potential to develop into a really good international side in the next three to four years
5250718 ive been an admirer of scotland and the work that alan tait has undertaken in the last few seasons
5250719 i look forward to being part of franks coaching team and to getting the players trust and buy in to the defensive systems ill look to put in place the experience ive gleaned from involvement in both union and league will hold me in good stead
5250720 im very excited to be coming back because i thoroughly enjoyed my previous spell
5250721 glasgow have been improving every year and im impressed with the ambition sean lineen has for the team

5250735 we cant ignore where we are we cant say were not going to do technology because technology is part of society all over the world
5250736 theres a lot of anxiety among parents about preparing their child academically and a lot of the products tap into that anxiety
5250737 for many years its been called the halo effect the idea that if something is digital or attached to the computer it has an educational benefit
5250738 its not just a set of blocks and box of crayons anymore
5250739 its amazing how parents spend millions of dollars on toys but kids are sometimes happiest with the simplest toys
5250740 it would be nice to say parents buy these five toys and your children will be smarter and happier but it just doesnt work that way
5250741 the computer can be the beginning to another physical experience or an outdoor experience so it doesnt simply end on the screen

5250744 a much more active phenomenon than it used to be
5250745 the findings suggest that adults are better at detecting false reports than they are at detecting false denials while accurately detecting false reports protects innocent people from false allegations the failure to detect false denials could mean that adults fail to protect children who falsely deny actual victimisation

5250764 listening to music is soothing and has often been associated with controlling patient reported pain or anxiety and acutely reducing blood pressure
5250765 but for the first time our results clearly illustrate the impact that daily music listening has we are excited about the positive implications for both patients and physicians who can now confidently explore music listening as a safe effective non pharmacological treatment option or a complement to therapy
5250766 my nose completely clogs up my throat will sometimes depending on the type of allergy close up as well red puffy eyes just very itchy
5250767 we found that stress and anxiety make a big difference in terms of allergic responses
5250768 if you dont have an allergy youre just going to see a little bit of redness temporarily and thatll be the end of it but if youre a highly allergic person youre going to get something called a wheal
5250769 so the take home message is if youre allergic stress and anxiety are a bad combination

5250781 we designed the computer simulations to show that as the ocean temperature increased hurricanes would form more rapidly and easily even in the presence of wind shear

5250796 hey matthew your shit is really starting to stink now step up to the plate and do something of interest man and stop fucking coasting on your good looks
5250797 for example in a paper making factory you know the process of chopping trees grinding the wood wetting it drying it trying to make paper in a paper making factory try to imagine mechanical feelers across the width of the paper roll because you know they roll the paper up roll it up into reams and reams and the width is very large so imagine mechanical feelers across the width of the roll and the width is very large mechanical feelers across the width and they pick up humidity temperature things like that these feelers they pick up things like humidity at that specific area on the roll and as i said just now the width of the roll is very large and so you imagine these feelers across the entire width telling you if the humidity is too high or too low or telling you if the temperature is too high or too low
5250798 you have two guys run down to first they have equal times but one has much better form which one do you choose

5250802 so far the international economic consequences of the war in the caucasus have been fairly minor despite georgias role as a major corridor for oil shipments but as i was reading the latest bad news i found myself wondering whether this war is an omen a sign that the second great age of globalization may share the fate of the first if youre wondering what im talking about heres what you need to know our grandfathers lived in a world of largely self sufficient inward looking national economies but our great great grandfathers lived as we do in a world of large scale international trade and investment a world destroyed by nationalism
5250803 writing in 1919 the great british economist john maynard keynes described the world economy as it was on the eve of world war i the inhabitant of london could order by telephone sipping his morning tea in bed the various products of the whole earth he could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world and keyness londoner regarded this state of affairs as normal certain and permanent except in the direction of further improvement the projects and politics of militarism and imperialism of racial and cultural rivalries of monopolies restrictions and exclusion appeared to exercise almost no influence at all on the ordinary course of social and economic life the internationalization of which was nearly complete in practice but then came three decades of war revolution political instability depression and more war by the end of world war ii the world was fragmented economically as well as politically and it took a couple of generations to put it back together
5250804 can things fall apart again yes they can consider how things have played out in the current food crisis for years we were told that self sufficiency was an outmoded concept and that it was safe to rely on world markets for food supplies but when the prices of wheat rice and corn soared keyness projects and politics of restrictions and exclusion made a comeback many governments rushed to protect domestic consumers by banning or limiting exports leaving food importing countries in dire straits and now comes militarism and imperialism by itself as i said the war in georgia isnt that big a deal economically but it does mark the end of the pax americana the era in which the united states more or less maintained a monopoly on the use of military force and that raises some real questions about the future of globalization
5250805 most obviously europes dependence on russian energy especially natural gas now looks very dangerous more dangerous arguably than its dependence on middle eastern oil after all russia has already used gas as a weapon in 2006 it cut off supplies to ukraine amid a dispute over prices and if russia is willing and able to use force to assert control over its self declared sphere of influence wont others do the same just think about the global economic disruption that would follow if china which is about to surpass the united states as the worlds largest manufacturing nation were to forcibly assert its claim to taiwan
5250806 some analysts tell us not to worry global economic integration itself protects us against war they argue because successful trading economies wont risk their prosperity by engaging in military adventurism but this too raises unpleasant historical memories as angell pointed out in his book in the modern industrial era even military victors lose far more than they gain he was right but wars kept happening anyway so are the foundations of the second global economy any more solid than those of the first in some ways yes for example war among the nations of western europe really does seem inconceivable now not so much because of economic ties as because of shared democratic values much of the world however including nations that play a key role in the global economy doesnt share those values most of us have proceeded on the belief that at least as far as economics goes this doesnt matter that we can count on world trade continuing to flow freely simply because its so profitable but thats not a safe assumption angell was right to describe the belief that conquest pays as a great illusion but the belief that economic rationality always prevents war is an equally great illusion and todays high degree of global economic interdependence which can be sustained only if all major governments act sensibly is more fragile than we imagine

5250941 this riot or demonstration could cause disorder and bigger problems because in the past illegal demonstrators burned down the thai embassy making the government pay tens of millions of dollars back to thailand they should travel to encourage soldiers at preah vihear temple
5250942 we gathered at our head office they tore down the banners at the head office this reflects the polices weaknesses cambodians are demonstrating to demand that thai troops pull out of cambodian territory but authorities cracked down on us instead police should have cooperated with workers and teachers
5250943 i think the suppression showed the weakness of the authorities for this dispute we do not need to negotiate with thailand because thailand invaded cambodia we must file a complaint with the un security council and unesco
5250944 the meeting will achieve good success in resolving the problem step by step
5250945 i think that at the meeting today monday and tomorrow we will achieve the total withdrawal of the troops at the pagoda and around the pagoda so the problem will be settled

5250966 if you guys are going to run stuff and run every lie under the sun have somebody stand up for somebody have me as a man who ended a relationship stand here and write some truth have me stand up for somebody and write that jennifer aniston is the smartest most sophisticated person i think ive ever met shes one of the most lovely people ive ever met in my life and im going through something thats a very personal thing and you have to give that up you have to give everything up because you cant have it all and it sucks
5250967 im sorry that the storys not interesting but its about time that somebody stands up for that girl and i think shes great
5250968 the most normal thing in the world theres no lying theres no cheating theres no nothing people are different they have different chemistry they have different lives its not about years its about going out with somebody being truthful on the way in being truthful in the middle and being truthful on the way out
5250969 why are you asking me that question im being as honest as i can possibly can be i ended a relationship because there is no lying i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right i dont waste peoples time i dont do the taper
5250970 i guarantee you that 20 percent of the people on this street right now who are in a relationship wish they could get out but they dont know how and im going to be honest on the way in to my relationships and im going to be honest on the way out of my relationships
5250971 tell of a fat black womans trials and tribulations as well as her moments of triumph in a foreign land
5250972 designing a car however is more than creating a shape it is creating a shape with the right proportions
5250973 the scenario came about this way the pastor abraham sani who took the young man to the waterside for baptism is a member of four or five pastors as occasion demands who would normally go with batches of new converts for baptism they are done periodically and quarterly in batches of fifties hundreds or as many as we can gather on a particular occasion
5250974 the pastor involved sani a young pastor was on hand when this new covert anita came in on first occasion and he happened to be her counselor to supervise her spiritual life monitor it and give her proper spiritual guidance at a point in time in the process the new convert intimated our pastor sani that she wanted to undergo a marriage in another church and that that church wanted a certificate may be a testimonial a recommendation from her present church that she is the one they can vouch for in character and upbringing in christiandom
5250975 on this occasion when the new convert intimated her mission he sani sought the permission of the resident pastor spiritual who bears absolute responsibility for the programme water baptism
5250976 you dont do it it is improper to go on that mission on the occasion
5250977 i have it on record that as a matter of fact the resident pastor on three separate occasions refused to give him approval to go on that assignment
5250978 had to seek the permission of another pastor in charge of administration and technical this senior pastor was not aware of what had transpired between the pastor responsible who had traveled and the young pastor sani who came for approval
5250979 so when he pastor sani was going being alone with this new convert a lady for that matter he found this young man emmanuel olayiwola
5250980 as they got into the water our own pastor sani noticed according to him that the sand underground was giving way and he had to scramble out to safety as he pastor sani was in front turning back as soon as he got to the dry land he looked and found that the young man was not following him and if anything at all he emmanuel was actually sinking the other way
5250981 when all efforts failed as the young man had gone under water he pastor sani ran to the community and some fishermen offered to help they came tried nothing happened
5250982 by the time he came the resident pastor administration and technical who gave him the approval had to call elders of the church i was one of those contacted and i rushed to the church at about 2 30 p m i met them and we agreed that the first thing to do was to alert the police of the missing worker of the church on an assignment
5250983 we got him on phone and he exclaimed my son under water
5250984 the marine police were contacted and they brought in their divers meanwhile night fall has come upon us and we had to go there with generator sets and halogen lamps it was an unfortunate situation because the boy was a very amiable young man like a son to everybody here we used to call him by his first name and most of our children were his colleagues we are have been in the mood of mourning since the incident
5250985 but we are not defending we are not doing anything we want to get over the mourning period by which time our own internal investigation would have been totally concluded and then we forward our findings and perhaps recommendations to the general overseer who was totally caught unawares by this development
5250986 considering the assistance which the church gave him in the course of seeking admission he normally came every weekend to assist the church in setting up their electrical system and other things
5250987 we have received drugs from the government and the royal palace but we will need more if troops move back in basics like paracetamol based mixagrip for fevers and vitamin c
5250988 if thailand does not permanently withdraw its troops after these meetings we are looking at some serious potential epidemics on the border as well as some very big sanitation issues
5250989 we have plenty of food but it is all dried or tinned and there are no fresh vegetables
5250990 if the talks fail and we have to dig in again there are going to be casualties on both sides from poor nutrition and of course malaria some have fallen ill already

5250998 enabling servants of the government suffering from sickness to avail of its advantage
5250999 the indian government has given him too much importance he is a nepali
5251000 once at an institute norgay was asked his nationality after achieving so much he felt hurt by the question so in anger he replied that he was a nepali why was it so difficult to accept him as an indian he has been one of a kind known as a snow leopard and his house still stands here
5251001 maintaining the social balance is important we therefore need to monitor our economic growth in a manner that guards us from a sudden impact of any kind
5251002 despu s de analizar la situaci n y consultar a consejeros legales y aliados pol ticos decid dimitir
5251003 ni una sola acusaci n en mi contra se sostiene
5251004 no pueden probar ninguna acusaci n porque nunca hice nada para mi provecho todo lo hice siempre por pakist n
5251005 desafortunadamente algunos elementos con intereses ocultos levantaron falsas acusaciones en mi contra
5251006 dicen que durante los ltimos nueve a os nuestros problemas econ micos y los cortes de electricidad se debieron a nuestras pol ticas es absolutamente falso
5251007 podr n tener xito contra m pero no se han dado cuenta hasta qu punto podr a ser perjudicial para el pa s
5251008 en el mapa mundial pakist n es ahora un pa s importante por la gracia de al
5251009 the meeting will achieve good success in resolving the problem step by step
5251010 i think that at the meeting today and tomorrow we will achieve the total withdrawal of the troops at the pagoda and around the pagoda so the problem will be settled
5251011 no me lo imaginaba ni en mis mejores sue o
5251012 a total of 49 deaths corresponding to 1 18 per cent mortality among the enrolled patients were recorded during the studies
5251013 as our organisation is working for the welfare of children facing medical challenges we used to hear or read that several studies are being conducted on human babies in the country
5251014 i wanted to get the factual information on such trials so we can press the government to formulate some specific policy to regulate it
5251015 no me lo imaginaba ni en mis mejores sue o
5251016 we ask the state governor to beef up security in and around the places where migrant labourers from hindu and sikh communities reside
5251017 some miscreants can take benefit of the worsening situation in kashmir valley by harassing minorities therefore crpf forces should be deployed to guard them
5251018 ac ghaffur was the subject of direct surveillance and given a pseudo name vivaldi this was a direct attack on his honesty and integrity
5251019 we have evidence to prove raja and his aide akshya behera alias chagalas involvement in the murder case
5251020 after the president resigned i also felt morally bound to resign
5251021 i have informed him that i can no longer continue my duties and would like to be relieved as cricket chairman
5251022 wir werden die f hrung der russischen f deration um einen milit rst tzpunkt in s dossetien bitten weil russische b rger hier leben
5251023 wir haben kein vertrauen in diese internationalen beobachter diese leute verdrehen die wahrheit
5251024 had there been no green revolution millions would have died of famine it was a much needed thing to happen there is a need to take the first green revolution forward
5251025 look at indias green revolution it worked for a short time but now the price is being paid
5251026 one should not forget that the developed nations are the potential obstacle in the way of developing countries farm sector
5251027 india must use biotechnology effectively to optimise productivity ninety percent of our farmers are small landholders owning less than one hectare
5251028 with three times your body weight pounding on your feet with every step its important to have the right shoes
5251029 there were no fire stations in buckhead that were closed

5251031 nous ne savons pas quand il sest bless a d clar lentra neur de liu sun haiping cest un probl me depuis six ou sept ans
5251032 nous avons travaill dur tous les jours mais voil le r sultat et cest dur encaisser
5251033 il ny a aucune surprise il est pr t je suis pr t a r sum merritt le temps de la confrontation est arriv
5251034 der markt zieht an ohne dass daf r ein echter ausl ser auszumachen w re
5251035 da reicht eine kleine order und alles springt an f r investoren ist das im moment ein geduldsspiel eigentlich wei niemand was er machen soll also machen die meisten nur das aller n tigste
5251036 einige analysten haben das r wort in den mund genommen
5251037 und in einer rezession braucht man nun wirklich keine aktien der metro von adidas oder der lufthansa
5251038 die aktien der fluggesellschaften hatten vom lpreisr ckgang besonders stark profitiert
5251039 aber der weg ist noch lang daher nehmen die leute immer mal rasch gewinne mit wenn der lpreis wieder steigt
5251040 i hope they hurry up and find a cure quick
5251041 i passed the test its actually quite hard to fail i think
5251042 we had what i called a clapham junction day when you know the phones were ringing there were lots of things to do and i was just kind of flat lining almost i just couldnt deal with it and i thought theres more theres more
5251043 its unusual because people deal with me and they refuse to believe i have alzheimers because at the moment i can speak very coherently i can plot a novel
5251044 i type badly if it wasnt for my loss of typing ability i might doubt the fact that i have alzheimers
5251045 its now hunt and peck and there will be a moment sometimes when the letter a just totally vanishes and i dont quite know what happens
5251046 its as if the keyboard closes up and the letter a is not there anymore then ill blink a few times and then the letter a comes back
5251047 the basic test for example will ask you questions like what day of the week is it what is the date i have a pa so there are really only two types of day is my pa in or is my pa out what day of the week is it well if hes not here then its probably the weekend
5251048 one of the questions was how many animals can you name
5251049 my wife said you would pick up the shirt and look at it as if you were looking at some kind of new thing that you had to wear and now you just put it on and just do the buttons up and you dont think about it
5251050 one piece of advice i was given by a specialist was surround yourself with toys he didnt mean buy stuff but try to make your life as interesting as possible keep yourself active keep yourself interested
5251051 my fans across the world started to contact me and in fact the website fell over and it was just getting ridiculous so i sent out a message saying its only worth asking me if you can help if youre a high end brain specialist
5251052 about a dozen or more contacted me saying i dont know about high end but im head of the department of whatever at so and so university
5251053 something like a cure i suspect is in the pipeline but i think its a fairly long pipe so i dont think it will be in time for me one lives in hope
5251054 you get dark days its one step beyond cant find your mobile phone cant find your car keys
5251055 in addition to his bladder his hairstyle and his sense of humour my father willed to me his stoicism
5251056 if theres nothing you can do about something then dont do it you have to learn to program your life around the fact
5251057 he tips them off he loves the attention jen didnt want to believe it was happening but it was and she has no tolerance for that
5251058 cobwebs come flying out of mayers wallet when he opens it john liked living like a movie star when he was with her jen would never say anything but you could tell it irritated her
5251059 some consumers are giving up some size but want to hang onto amenities they got used to
5251060 these are competing consumer behaviors and im not sure which will outweigh the other
5251061 with an industry running at only 12 million to 13 million annual sales rates now its even more important to have the right vehicle at the right price at the right time
5251062 stale inventory is a problem because it costs you lots of incentive money so everybody is studying this hard
5251063 these people include many boomers who are in their peak earning years and have become accustomed to leather seats and higher levels of trim moon roofs audio systems and navigation systems
5251064 theyre holding onto their satellite radio and whatever else makes them smile
5251065 they may be even moving up a bit in content
5251066 options that were once seen as luxury car only are becoming more common on compact cars
5251067 as long as automakers are willing to supply the same type of equipment in a smaller package with better fuel economy buyers wont need to sacrifice conveniences in their search for higher gas mileage
5251068 but now were seeing that the people who are getting four cylinders in these vehicles dont want to give up the creature comforts
5251069 customers are looking at these attributes more because they want vehicles that are as safe as a much larger car
5251070 when consumers see that some of our vehicles in the compact and subcompact segments have these features they feel more comfortable about making that move
5251071 people know when they come to volkswagen that even our base jetta is a lot of car
5251072 there is no stripper version it starts with air conditioning and cruise control and safety features
5251073 if gasoline is costing you 100 a week when it may have cost you 50 a week before and youre not seeing a raise something has got to give in many households
5251074 if you drive 15 000 miles a year the difference in fuel savings between a c and d class vehicle is about 25 a month
5251075 but these are pretty inflationary times bread and milk for example are also more expensive so 25 doesnt go very far
5251076 someone in financial stress isnt going to say that car is cool but lets add fog lamps and performance tires
5251077 its led by features such as sync and also a mix where theres more movement to high end models such as ses as people trade down they dont seem to be trading down in specification levels
5251078 the market is moving toward more content but consumers arent equipping small cars with as many accessories as in larger cars even as they move toward more small cars
5251079 increasing content in gm vehicles is going to drive revenues but consumers are willing to pay for it
5251080 in the past we were more likely to discount or not charge at all for certain features to improve our market penetration but now theres a market for it
5251081 discussing volumes with our executives to see if we need to expand or add any additional trim levels in the future
5251082 are becoming amazingly emotional to buyers the idea of entry car prestige is emergent
5251083 an entry level product that is amenable to buyers needs for bells and whistles
5251084 our target approach is to have a base level price but with prestige emotion and high design around it
5251085 i am to my beloved as my beloved is to me
5251086 how hard could it possibly be to make your own chuppah ill just go to the fabric store pick out some gorgeous fabric i like cut a big square add some trim and maybe 1 or 2 hours later it will be done one less task to take care of
5251087 it was the worst experience i ever had in my career ive identified the persons who attacked me ive spoken to the commissioner of police and lodged a complaint
5251088 ive given myself to the club for about 16 years so despite the incident i still love my former club im still a mohun baganite at heart but i condemn the incident
5251089 it was very sad especially when he has given so much to the club the offenders will be punished
5251090 kolkata used to be the mecca of indian football however there has been a shift in focus and rowdy behaviour of fans is adding up to this this should be stopped
5251091 the i league is coming up and if incidents such as this happens again then kolkata football might be in trouble i hope priyada aiff president priya ranjan das munshi takes strong action against this when the i league starts in september
5251092 im proud of subrata one of the finest stopper backs who has contributed immensely not only to the nation but to the state and his club
5251093 after the president resigned i also felt morally bound to resign
5251094 i have informed him that i can no longer continue my duties and would like to be relieved as cricket chairman
5251095 the resignation of an individual does not affect the working of an institution and the champions trophy would be held on schedule and properly
5251096 in a sense thats the argumentative indian who is finding his voice in poetry these verses are written from many viewpoints from those of a bureaucrat and a lawyer to a politician and a modern day commentator of daily life
5251097 with the enormous experience one has gone through words find their own way the cell phone was a handy gadget a dream come true
5251098 arka das 14 wanted his classmate sagar doluis i pod he asked sagars sister siuli 9 to come to him with the i pod at tilpara barrage a reservoir over mayurakshi river seven km from siuri on sunday evening so that he could click photographs of her when the girl reached the spot he snatched the i pod from her and pushed her off the barrage
5251099 i told siuli to hand me the i pod when she refused i snatched it from her and threw her down the barrage
5251100 but when i saw that siuli had fallen on the bank of the river instead of the water and was alive i was scared that she will tell the elders so first i tried to choke her to death and then smashed her head with a stone
5251101 arka said siuli had gone with him for a walk down the mayurakshi river but while returning home parted way saying she has some important work to do hearing that her parents filed a missing complaint at siuri police station late sunday night
5251102 his parents want him to succeed today and in subsequent rounds and win a gold for india it will be a big achievement for a sportsman from a humble background
5251103 after his last victory over russian world champion sergey vodopyanov in the pre quarterfinals he told me that he would try for the gold medal he has worked very hard to reach this level i wish him all success
5251104 we are opposing the governments move to merge state bank of saurashtra with sbi these types of mergers are against the interests of common people
5251105 this is a token strike if the government and the bank management do not listen to our demands we may go for an indefinite strike from september
5251106 the zimbabwean issue is far from resolved and so the continent as a whole has a responsibility to continue to engage with us in finding solutions
5251107 part of it is actually a process of trying to unlock the deadlocks that have emerged in the negotiations
5251108 unless tsvangirai signs on the dotted line the crisis continues not only simply because the billions of foreign aid does not become available but also because he does represent a significant majority of the zimbabwean population
5251109 i fell into the indoor market and plummeted between stalls people were walking at me from every aisle and turning i had to dance around them all i was so far inside myself they couldnt see me i didnt want them to see me i felt dizzy and sick they didnt want to see someone like that
5251110 i dont want the people of pakistan to slide deeper and deeper into uncertainty
5251111 for the interest of the nation i have decided to resign as president
5251112 i am not asking for anything i will let the people of pakistan decide my future

5251118 his right heel injury has been a problem since six years ago even before the athens olympics
5251119 on august 16 we arrived at the olympic village medical experts analyzed lius injury and specified there was a problem on lius achilless tendon
5251120 i think the chinese people will understand the situation and will enncourage him to come back to the track and perform well
5251121 i cant believe this has happened he is my hero
5251122 i came here especially to see him i am devastasted i just bought one ticket the olympics is over for me as well as liu xiang
5251123 with events like track and field chinas pace in winning gold medals will slow down
5251124 when we found the contamination it was another sign that the way we currently manufacture heparin is simply unsafe
5251125 unlike the current heparin that is harvested from possibly disease carrying animals in often very poor conditions our fully synthetic heparin will be created in a pharmaceutical manufacturing environment from fermentation to packaging this will give drug manufacturers extreme control over the safety and purity of the product
5251126 a neurons excitability whether it will fire hinges on this delicate equilibrium
5251127 finding statistically robust associations linked to two proteins that may be involved in regulating such ion channels and that are also thought to be targets of drugs used to clinically to treat bipolar disorder is astonishing
5251128 faced with little agreement among previous studies searching for the genomic hot spots in bipolar disorder these researchers pooled their data for maximal statistical power and unearthed surprising results
5251129 improved understanding of these abnormalities could lead to new hope for the millions of americans affected by bipolar disorder

5251249 the delay in the itc investment tax credit renewal has meant that large commercial jobs are being postponed
5251250 because they dont want to give the democratic congress any credit
5251251 many of these commercial projects are in important planning stages right now and the overall industry is at the tipping point that will lead to widespread adoption
5251252 the absence of the itc will kill most if not all of this growing momentum we need only look to the interruption of tax credits for the wind industry for an example of something that we do not want to repeat this would be a real shame
5251253 over the longer term however the united states commercial market is far too important to be ignored
5251254 a consistent itc policy extending over several years that allows industry to grow and flourish is critical to the industry
5251255 the itc has become a very politicized issue however and its possible that approval could extend into 2009
5251256 the jobs lost in the u s would move overseas to more favorable solar markets
5251257 solar power will eventually reach cost parity with other energy sources but that will not occur in the next few years without incentives

5251276 guys are trying to get used to each other especially in the preseason weve got guys rotating in and out so much youre hardly ever next to the same guy i think thats part of it thats why you play preseason games to get the timing down
5251277 its a little bit of both having new guys in new positions and getting used to the technique and executing your blocks
5251278 at the same time the other team is making plays we have to make and finish plays rather than allow them to get into the lanes were supposed to keep them out of
5251279 right now we kind of have an idea whos going to be out there were trying to roll some guys in including some of the younger guys who we may not have seen in a game setting
5251280 i was thinking about running before i even made the catch
5251281 im thinking about everything you cant do nothing without the ball im trying to make a play instead of focusing on little things
5251282 the most important thing on offense is to secure the ball first whether it be a handoff catching a pass or fielding a punt
5251283 as far as special teams ive never done it i want to go out and prove to myself that i can do it
5251284 special teams is all about effort its a one play kind of situation
5251285 you dont get to line up on second down and remake anything special teams requires you to go 100 percent
5251286 watching the films what i see is a lot of guys here learning the system working to get into place
5251287 its preseason right now and its trial and error were going to get better by the time the season comes
5251288 the lanes on the punt returns you have to be patient back there im seeing some lanes but it seems hard to get to them but im going to stay patient and work on it
5251289 i know they are great fans but there are also people i will say for a minute that i read message boards and got caught up in that whole thing
5251290 that even put more stress on me just worrying about what people thought about me people say a lot of times i dont care what people think about me me personally i dont care how people perceive me when they look at my hair but i like people to think great things about shawn andrews but you cant please the world
5251291 my father was out of work so i was eligible i was single and i was out of school and all and unemployed
5251292 it was good physical work good hard work but we were well fed and well cared for
5251293 young professionals across the nation conservation professionals park professionals have really stepped forward to honor the guys
5251294 at the time during the depression it was tough and my father was working for a company in waterbury and he was only working a couple days a week
5251295 so we needed food on the table there were seven of us besides mother and father nine people ate a lot of food
5251296 they need it today it would be wonderful today if they had it and got the kids off the street and into a camp like that work hard and earn money and learn what life is all about

5251314 there were things in that discipline packet that would break my heart
5251315 it would make me so angry in my heart i believed the teachers deserved more
5251316 our decision making is based on the 17 peoples gut feelings

5251325 who wants to spend money on a guy whos not been here who knows if hes going to show up caused all this confusion i wouldnt have bought a ticket to see me either
5251326 i felt at some point i would have to face the fans so i figured it might as well be now
5251327 the line is kind of everything is organized so that its kind of fly by but some people lean in and say positive things im dealing with it keep your head up it really makes me feel good that im not the only one going through it
5251328 i kind of feel like some of the fans are going through it with me those that are admitting it those that know that they have it
5251329 i was kind of pessimistic how my teammates would receive me
5251330 there were a lot of rumors i admitted to my teammates i created a lot of those rumors at the time coach andy reid didnt know the truth people were saying it was really about his contract didnt want to play football anymore and i admit that i created those rumors just out of a lot of frustration and didnt care what people thought
5251331 you have a guy whos quick tempered whos to the point where i really didnt care anymore thats not the real me i just didnt realize what i was going through
5251332 a few weeks ago was the first time ive ever opened up to anybody about anything that was part of the reason
5251333 coach reid after he realized that shawn andrews did have a serious problem he was very positive about the situation hes a funny guy he helps you laugh tries to make the situation better
5251334 i just wanted to talk to those guys face to face man to man
5251335 i just felt like whether they believed me or not i did my part in my mind i hope they believe me i think for the most part they do and i hope they respect me if they dont they will
5251336 i really cant put it into words id like their respect as a player but id like their respect as a person first life is short and there are a lot more things i can count that are more important than football
5251337 like i said i had a million and one thoughts going through my head
5251338 i just lost my love for a lot of things i didnt know which direction i was headed football wasnt even a thought
5251339 i would love to play against the patriots i mean it feels good to be back and around my teammates

5251341 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may affect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities
5251342 however it appears that mood is correlated with cognitive performance more so than medication use
5251343 a neurons excitability whether it will fire hinges on this delicate equilibrium
5251344 finding statistically robust associations linked to two proteins that may be involved in regulating such ion channels and that are also thought to be targets of drugs used to clinically to treat bipolar disorder is astonishing
5251345 faced with little agreement among previous studies searching for the genomic hot spots in bipolar disorder these researchers pooled their data for maximal statistical power and unearthed surprising results
5251346 improved understanding of these abnormalities could lead to new hope for the millions of americans affected by bipolar disorder
5251347 because of the great emphasis on harmony and family integration in many asian cultures family conflict is an important factor to consider when studying suicidal behaviors among asian americans
5251348 our study suggests that we need to more precisely determine the kinds of family conflicts that are associated with suicide risk among asian americans and find means of preventing these family problems
5251349 this is the first nationally representative investigation of family conflict and suicidal behaviors among asian americans
5251350 our findings suggest that high family conflict has an independent and additive effect in predicting lifetime suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts among asian americans
5251351 on average caregivers only slept about six and a half hours a night and took almost 23 minutes to fall asleep
5251352 using the sleep diary data that subjects kept at the same time however depression was the primary determinant of poor sleep with depressed subjects reporting less time asleep and more wake time over the week
5251353 sleep pattern differences between older adult dementia caregivers and older adult noncaregivers using objective and subject measures
5251354 as a result our bodies and brains feel less difference between day and night
5251355 people are sleeping in front of the tv or nodding off during conversations and taking long afternoon naps this leads to less sleep at night in a way their sleep habits become more like babies and less like those of healthy adults who sleep in consolidated periods during the night

5251405 adoptarea unei asemenea solutii infiintarea oltchim mbo n r a fost necesara si oportuna din prisma interesului managementului si a salariatilor de a dezvolta oltchim sa in contextul in care orice interventie a statului in calitate de actionar majoritar a fost in mod constant criticata de catre actionarii minoritari ca fiind susceptibila de a fi ajutor de stat
5251406 mentinerea incertitudinii asupra majorarii capitalului social afecteaza in sens negativ activitatea si finantarea societatii cu riscuri majore in viitorul apropiat
5251407 incercarile repetate ale managementului de a obtine finantari pentru sustinerea programelor de investitii si dezvoltarea combinatului esentiale pentru supravietuirea oltchim sa nu s au concretizat
5251408 ultima incercare de majorare a capitalului social cu 954 75 milioane lei a fost blocata in urma unei sesizari facute de un actionar minoritar pana la primirea unui raspuns oficial de la comisia europeana referitoare la posibila incadrare a acestei operatiuni ca ajutor de stat sc oltchim sa va intampina in continuare dificultati in obtinerea de credite bancare avantajoase
5251409 in acest moment oltchim mbo discuta cu mai multe banci si fonduri de investitii pentru a gasi o modalitate de finantare si atragere de resurse suplimentare pentru combinat
5251410 am dori sa reamintim ca in trecut chiar statul roman a promovat instrumente legislative menite a facilita salariatilor si managementului companiilor de stat participarea la procesul de privatizare daca la acest moment aceste facilitati nu mai sunt in vigoare nu inseamna ca exista o interdictie a participarii salariatilor si managementului la proces
5251411 de asemenea nu trebuie uitat ca exista si un principiu al egalitatii de sanse care trebuie respectat
5251412 principala cauza a pierderilor financiare mari a fost incadrarea combinatului intr o categorie de creditare cu risc ridicat ca urmare a scaderii capitalului social in noiembrie 2007 si a imposibilitatii majorarii capitalului social in 2008 fapt care a adus cu sine implicit obtinerea de credite in conditii mai putin avantajoase

5251431 we really want to get the message out to people
5251432 i got back the standard form letter thank you for your comment
5251433 how much would keeping your cars gas tank 25 full or less affect your gas mileage
5251434 natuurlijk wilden we graag bij de top drie eindigen maar de realiteit gebiedt me te zeggen dat onze vierde plaats momenteel toch dichter bij de realiteit aanleunt kevin en bob lootten hier immers meteen de regerende wereldkampioenen colin carr frankrijk en de regerende europese kampioenen knuudsen poulsen op de koop toe zorgt het vernieuwde duitse team hollstein ihle voor de stunt door deze twee toppers zomaar vlot te verslaan
5251435 maesen en de bont moesten dus wel op een maximaal toerental draaien om zich tussen die top drie te wringen en dat deden ze duidelijk niet mij verwondert dit niet echt want op duisburg na hebben bob en kevin nog geen echte toprace gevaren dit seizoen zij missen duidelijk wat wedstrijdritme en agressiviteit net daarom vind ik het helemaal geen ramp dat ze woensdag een extra wedstrijd moeten peddelen het geeft ons de kans om nog wat bij te sturen
5251436 uiteraard zijn ze daarin helemaal niet kansloos met een tweede snelste tijd van de zeven boten die in hun halve finalerace starten moet finishen bij de top drie en dus doorstoten tot de olympische finale best haalbaar zijn
5251437 mijn lies is soms wat gevoelig en de 100m en het verspringen zullen daardoor wat lastig zijn maar ik zie het zitten door mijn blessure had mijn voorbereiding beter gekund maar op training ben ik beter dan vorig jaar ik hoop dan ook beter te doen dan toen maar het wordt moeilijker dan op het wk om in de top 12 te eindigen ik verwacht een heel hoog niveau met waarschijnlijk ook een wereldrecord voor de amerikaan brian clay maar in tienkamp kan er voor iedereen altijd iets misgaan
5251438 daar zou ik heel tevreden mee zijn maar het is heel moeilijk te voorspellen ik denk dat het puntenaantal voor de top 12 ergens rond het belgisch record zal liggen op papier ben ik 17e van alle deelnemers maar ik wil zeker hoger eindigen
5251439 dat belgi nog geen medaille heeft kunnen behalen op deze spelen wakkert de verwachtingen naar ons toe natuurlijk nog aan
5251440 wij fixeren ons echter niet op het brons we gaan eerst en vooral voor een finale en daarin proberen we dan een belgisch record te lopen als we daarin slagen is een mooie plaats niet veraf
5251441 het heeft daarom ook niet veel zin om de andere landen te analyseren
5251442 de concurrentie is net het enige wat we niet onder controle hebben als we naar de anderen zouden kijken zou dat alles nog veel vermoeiender maken
5251443 we hebben gezien dat onze aflossingen op de laatste trainingen heel goed waren alle kleine problemen zijn onder controle en we zijn allemaal in vorm dus we zijn er helemaal klaar voor
5251444 het is zo goed als opgelost dus ik zal 200 kunnen voluit gaan
5251445 ik wil de beste wedstrijd van mijn leven zwemmen mijn trainingstijden zijn heel goed ik zwem nu na 8 km dezelfde tijden als tijdens wedstrijden op de 1500m twee jaar geleden dat toont aan dat ik in topvorm zit en mentaal zorgt dat voor rust ik denk dat ik een kans maak er zijn er misschien twee die te sterk zijn maar daarna zijn we met een tiental die zullen strijden voor het podium ik ben weliswaar de jongste maar ik ben hier zeker niet om te leren ik heb tegen iedereen al gezwommen en ik wil donderdag gewoonweg presteren
5251446 de omstandigheden zijn niet ideaal met heel warm water en veel algen maar ze zijn wel voor iedereen hetzelfde
5251447 de race wordt echter toch anders omdat er maar 25 starters zijn tegenover 50 70 in andere wedstrijden dat maakt de kans op een ontsnapping groter dus ik zal in de eerste 7 5 km moeten opletten en niet te veel achteraan zwemmen normaal zwem ik veel achteraan en zorg ik dat ik na driekwart wedstrijd vooraan zit
5251448 you did it you changed wild lament into whirling dance you ripped off my black mourning band and decked me with wildflowers im about to burst with song i cant keep quiet about you god my god i cant thank you enough
5251449 you will show me the way of life granting me the joy of your presence and the pleasures of living with you forever
5251450 its like you arent willing to do the hard things with god anymore everything sort of bores you
5251451 these things i remember as i pour out my soul how i used to go with the multitude leading the procession to the house of god with shouts of joy and thanksgiving
5251452 you will show me the way of life granting me the joy of your presence and the pleasures of living with you forever
5251453 at its most basic this is about getting more work by scottish theatre and dance practitioners to the festival but if that was all it was about i wouldnt be that excited
5251454 what i am really excited about is the capacity building element of the fund that is about knowledge and skills and ability the fringe society does a lot of work about how to get the best out of the fringe we want to extend that using this fund so that we can give scottish theatre and dance practitioners more advice and more help throughout the year
5251455 we have to wait until the rest of your teeth grow through

5251462 raising money is definitely pretty bizarre if i had the time i would write a book about this
5251463 i dont think the current environment is anything like the late nineties when companies were going public left right and center last quarter was the first quarter in 30 years when not one venture backed company went public so thats not much of a bubble

5251469 even the top republican in charge of the partys senate campaigns concedes that the gop will lose seats this year the only question is how many
5251470 democrats have solid chances of winning five seats according to strategists in both parties and public polls and realistic shots at picking off another three to five republican senators republicans have only one good opportunity for replacing a democrat in louisiana
5251471 party unity is an issue for obama in the buckeye state while mccain has an 89 7 lead with voters who identify as republicans obama has a narrower 75 17 edge with democrats delving deeper into the numbers it appears that residual unhappiness from hillary clinton supporters could be the cause the 25 of democrats who currently either support mccain or are undecided are disproportionately middle aged white and female or in other words prototypical clinton voters ohio is one state where some joint appearances of the former democratic foes might do the nominee some good

5251534 they always pass these authorizations with a lot of fanfare as if they are going to spend the money immediately but a lot of these bond bills are over five or ten years
5251535 there is the issue of giving false expectations that theyll be spent in the near term
5251536 you just cant keep spending and borrowing at that rate and expect that taxpayers are going to continue to pay higher taxes
5251537 borrowing so much that hes going to turn around and ask for a very large tax increase
5251538 the bonding is based very much on an affordability analysis
5251539 our capital plan is not a wish list there are some choices that we made
5251540 we can even speed it up if things get really great or slow it down if we hit a wall
5251541 its very much up to the administration to manage it in an effective manner
5251542 if you are irresponsible about that borrowing that can be a problem
5251543 smoking hot its ac dc like we love them loud anthemic and hard

5251545 there remains an industry problem associated with broad awareness of the availability
5251546 but once you have a trial use by the consumer of this service there is very high customer satisfaction
5251547 we see clinics as an emerging industry and we expect to see continued changes and evolution in that space but i can tell you that we are excited about the strong interest that we are getting from hospitals and health care systems
5251548 the bottom line is that its difficult to first of all get this idea across and make people aware of where these locations are and then finally to feel comfortable to actually get their health care in a retail store

5251553 he didnt have to get the gold but its disappointing he didnt get to the final he was our only hope in track and field
5251554 he must have been injured because there isnt any other reason for him to not compete
5251555 some chinese might not understand so they might think there are other reasons that caused him to pull out
5251556 we are disappointed but at the next games he will win
5251557 for us the most important thing is that china hosts a successful olympics
5251558 we not only come to support liu xiang were here to support the olympic games
5251559 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5251560 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5251561 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5251562 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5251563 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5251564 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5251565 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5251566 i bought the bracelet and i thought of him as my bracelet brother
5251567 i always thought if i ever had a brother he would be named george

5251578 the 3 2001 105 is a primary containment isolation valve and is currently closed
5251579 theres a lot of baby boomers whose kids are now out of the house and theyre finding the time and money to put into it
5251580 the only thing is some of the cars have newer engines
5251581 some of us are getting to the age where it just doesnt matter
5251582 we may not be here next year so we may as well go for it
5251583 you cant worry about the cost ive always been into cars so this is what i do
5251584 it seems like it certainly does violate peoples constitutional rights
5251585 instead of seeking to stifle the political speech of residents officials and others should encourage and celebrate the fact that so many people are interested in civic affairs
5251586 hell will freeze over before i allow the gazette or the aclu to affect my vote on this issue
5251587 we represent the people and the people dont want signs up year round
5251588 forty five days is plenty of time to have political signs up
5251589 if you put them up any earlier youre just wasting your time
5251590 ive had to put signs in my window to avoid this
5251591 so its definitely something thats going to need to be repealed
5251592 weve seen rulings come down both ways but theres a tendency to lean towards protecting free speech he said
5251593 when i began thinking about a career change my initial goal was to open a tea caf however to be sure i wanted to take the route of becoming my own boss and a business owner i decided to test the waters with my tea flavoured shortbread
5251594 if our firm is in trouble we would rather fund ourselves than fund you hedge funds
5251595 it was definitely an honor to win the stanford st jude championship last year not only because of the talented field i competed against but because of the special place this tournament holds in this communitys heart and the wonderful charity it benefits
5251596 i look forward to returning to memphis in two months to defend my title
5251597 celebrating our 51st year in memphis the stanford st jude championship has a very rich history
5251598 it is the strong support of the community as well as the commitment from dedicated sponsors such as stanford financial group and fedex that make it one of the longest running tournaments on the pga tour were excited with the way this years field is shaping up and were looking forward to entertaining our fans with another first class tournament
5251599 it is always gratifying to see one of the nci designated cancer centers achieve comprehensive status recognition of excellence not only in state of the art care and cancer research but also in patient education community outreach and the dissemination of vital information to professionals and the public
5251600 these extra efforts to establish programs that reach out to surrounding communities and patients are the hallmarks of our comprehensive centers which now number 41 this enhanced designation is a timely recognition of important contributions and advances made by the dedicated staff of st jude
5251601 being designated a comprehensive cancer center is a prestigious accomplishment and to be the only pediatric center is an incomparable distinction for st jude
5251602 st jude is well known for having innovative programs led by the best and the brightest faculty and staff now being awarded comprehensive stature places an additional nci imprimatur on st jude and further validates our position among the countrys leading cancer centers this also speaks volumes about dr kastans strong leadership as our cancer center director
5251603 its rewarding to see a designation of comprehensive to an institution that is exclusively focused on children
5251604 they have a huge population of survivors that they alone have the resources and capability to bring back for follow up studies so they are to be congratulated and envied in that they are the only uniquely pediatric cancer center in the country
5251605 our international outreach program directed by dr raul ribeiro is a wonderful example of how a medical institution can provide important services to local national and worldwide communities
5251606 in addition to the effective web based efforts st jude has a long and successful track record of bringing modern medicine to less advantaged countries through education of local health care providers and establishment of pediatric cancer clinics
5251607 while maintaining significant activities in education and community service st jude will continue its major efforts in both basic laboratory research and clinical investigation to better understand the biology of cancer and develop novel treatment approaches
5251608 you have heard about twitter maybe its something other people do mainly younger people you subscribe to the service then you can post little messages on peoples cellphones or on their instant message accounts about nothing
5251609 many times physicians will look at a childs scans and assume that it is impossible to remove the tumor while preserving some uninvolved kidney but our study indicates that surgeons should not rely solely on the imaging to make that decision
5251610 in most cases the surgeon will be able to save normal kidney on both sides
5251611 the study indicates that when combined with chemotherapy and radiation therapy this surgical approach provides an opportunity to preserve renal function while maintaining a high probability of cure
5251612 commonly when a child has bilateral disease the surgeon will remove the kidney that has the most tumor and do a partial nephrectomy on the other side
5251613 but if a patient then develops problems in the remaining kidney the options are limited because one kidney has been taken out of the equation at st jude we try to save as much kidney as possible in children with bilateral disease thus far 100 percent of the time we have been able to save normal kidney on both sides
5251614 it was definitely an honor to win the stanford st jude championship last year not only because of the talented field i competed against but because of the special place this tournament holds in this communitys heart and the wonderful charity it benefits
5251615 i look forward to returning to memphis in two months to defend my title
5251616 celebrating our 51st year in memphis the stanford st jude championship has a very rich history
5251617 it is the strong support of the community as well as the commitment from dedicated sponsors such as stanford financial group and fedex that make it one of the longest running tournaments on the pga tour were excited with the way this years field is shaping up and were looking forward to entertaining our fans with another first class tournament
5251618 you pray every day for a day like this to unfold
5251619 lessons learned through life are there not necessarily for good or bad reasons you just have to take them as they are and move forward
5251620 it is without a doubt a very busy time for us but at least we know when its coming and what to expect
5251621 in accordance with ohio law we have on file the birth records of every child born in ross county so theres no other place they can go to get a copy they have to come here
5251622 genealogists knew it was coming and in the weeks and months leading up to the implementation of the new law they were in here every day buying any of the uncertified copies they thought they would ever need
5251623 back when gus macker first came here and was very popular we were usually very busy for a few days before the tournament since a lot of the players needed to prove their age
5251624 theres a pretty steady stream of traffic leading up to the school year
5251625 and we have a pretty handy setup since many parents will come in to our nurse of the day clinic to have their child immunized and then walk right up the hallway to get the birth certificate they need
5251626 this motility is also called dancing because when you electrically stimulate an outer hair cell with a sound the cell body spontaneously elongates and contracts along with the sound
5251627 it is very dramatic to see these hair cells dance with the sound
5251628 we found that these mice showed exactly the same kinds of hearing deficiency as the previous knockout mice
5251629 therefore we believe that these experiments eliminate criticism of our earlier experiments with the knockout mice
5251630 with this study we still cannot really exclude stereociliary motility from contributing to cochlear amplification because eliminating somatic motility also reduces ciliary motility so it is not possible to totally isolate either form of motility in fact we hypothesize that the two mechanisms might work together in different aspects of amplification
5251631 for example an overdose of aspirin causes a high frequency hearing loss by inhibiting prestins function
5251632 also there is evidence that many cases of high frequency hearing loss are caused by defects in the cells molecular machinery that involves prestin and two mutations that have been detected in the prestin gene in humans are reported to be associated with deafness
5251633 the new information is important because it helps identify children who are most at risk for severe disease using easily available clinical information
5251634 this narrows down the patient population who needs to be considered for antiviral therapy which is costly and often inconvenient to receive from a childs perspective for example one treatment for rsv infection is to have the child breathe an aerosolized form of the antiviral drug ribavirin for 12 to 18 hours which is tough for the child and the parent
5251635 this finding is important because with cancer patients clinicians are used to identifying those at risk for bacterial and fungal infections based on a patient having neutropenia
5251636 we decided to analyze the course of rsv infection in children being treated for cancer to identify factors that could help us predict which ones were at highest risk for severe disease or death due to a lower respiratory tract infection with this virus
5251637 we think we have identified a pathway that can be used to prevent tumor formation and a potential target for therapy
5251638 we were interested in whether there were signals that inhibited tumor formation
5251639 and if there were which ones were they could they be used to identify new therapeutic targets
5251640 what was not known and what we now find is that the effect of bmps on normal gnp cells is almost exactly mimicked in gnp like tumor cells
5251641 what we found is that using a lower dose of the sonic hedgehog inhibitor in combination with bmp gives the same therapeutic effect as high doses of the hedgehog inhibitor
5251642 we hope that by reducing the levels of both compounds we might prevent the secondary effects on bone of this potential therapy
5251643 gene expression profiling will help us identify targets for future therapy
5251644 it is still crude but in the end you identify multiple genes for further study if you find a good target for therapy the next step is to develop molecular therapeutics for the target
5251645 pharmacogenetics is important to finding out a persons response and tolerance for a therapy
5251646 certain drugs may be good for 99 percent of patients but bad for 1 percent we need to find out who those patients are who are at risk so we can spare them from toxicity
5251647 we need to know the leukemic cell genetics that affect drug sensitivity or resistance and what role pharmacogenetics plays in treatment to improve efficacy and decrease toxicity
5251648 that way we dont over treat low risk patients or under treat high risk patients

5251650 instead of flaming the forums we decided to take matters into our own hands so we built twitsms a way for fans to keep getting their tweets via sms based on a user pays system per message
5251651 even with a limit of 250 messages received per week it could cost twitter about 1 000 per user per year to send sms outside of canada india or the us

5251657 this is probably the first description of what is happening mechanistically that contributes to the ability of cells to delay apoptosis
5251658 it provides incredible insights into how three proteins work and how they can control apoptosis
5251659 this suggests that the protein is playing basically the same role in humans as we described in mice
5251660 that was intriguing because several studies suggested that hax1 was controlled by cytokine signaling
5251661 also studies have suggested that if you overexpressed hax1 in cells the cells were protected from undergoing apoptosis
5251662 that additional window of survival is extremely important because in the body cytokines are limiting
5251663 the key observation was that hax1 was important in helping cells to survive importantly what happened to the mice we generated was remarkably similar to what happens if you remove the mitochondrial enzymes called htra2 or parl
5251664 because the control of cancer in the bone marrow has improved so much cns relapse has become proportionally more important
5251665 if we are to further increase the cure rate and improve the quality of life of our patients we need to concentrate on preventing cns relapse
5251666 most clinicians still feel strongly that high risk patients need radiation treatment because they think that without radiation such patients have a very high risk of relapse
5251667 but i disagree i think that we should avoid using radiation in all patients even those at high risk of relapse with optimal chemotherapy we can reduce the relapse rate to a very low level we should reserve radiation for the treatment of relapse whats more the salvage rate for cns relapse in patients who did not receive prior radiation is very high and if patients who are treated with radiation develop bone marrow or cns relapse later on it is more difficult to treat them successfully
5251668 optimization of intrathecal therapy to allow adequate distribution of intrathecal therapy in the cns and to avoid traumatic lumbar puncture which leads to an increase in cns relapse are essential for the success of cns directed treatment
5251669 however there are no conclusive trials that show this approach to be superior to intensive chemotherapy
5251670 so whether transplantation has any role in the treatment of isolated cns relapse is uncertain
5251671 cns relapse may just be the tip of the iceberg meaning that while we may see cns relapse there may be hidden leukemia in the bone marrow
5251672 at st jude our treatment protocols involve detecting subclinical cns leukemia early and treating it aggressively
5251673 such treatment has allowed both good cns and bone marrow control therefore we have achieved excellent outcomes for our patients
5251674 many times physicians will look at a childs scans and assume that it is impossible to remove the tumor while preserving some uninvolved kidney but our study indicates that surgeons should not rely solely on the imaging to make that decision
5251675 in most cases the surgeon will be able to save normal kidney on both sides
5251676 the study indicates that when combined with chemotherapy and radiation therapy this surgical approach provides an opportunity to preserve renal function while maintaining a high probability of cure
5251677 commonly when a child has bilateral disease the surgeon will remove the kidney that has the most tumor and do a partial nephrectomy on the other side
5251678 but if a patient then develops problems in the remaining kidney the options are limited because one kidney has been taken out of the equation at st jude we try to save as much kidney as possible in children with bilateral disease thus far 100 percent of the time we have been able to save normal kidney on both sides
5251679 these findings provide new avenues to pursue to gain a better understanding of these disease processes and ultimately to develop better therapies
5251680 it really takes a series of genetic lesions to lead to cancer
5251681 you may get activation of an oncogene but you may also need activation of a tumor suppressor gene and an alteration in a cell death pathway
5251682 it appears from our study and other work published previously that all you need to get cml is that chromosomal translocation and bcr abl1 expression
5251683 the vast majority of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemias are of b cell lineage
5251684 the loss of the ikaros gene is a nearly obligatory lesion for the development of bcr abl1 all
5251685 and clearly must be a genetic lesion that is cooperating with bcr abl1
5251686 that is an important finding that may give insight into how that transformation occurs or it may give insight into a better way to treat the disease if one can figure out how the ikaros deletion is working
5251687 we have now laid the foundation for a new future the risks have been reduced costs lowered strategy changed the management board renewed managers replaced
5251688 the same old folks that brought you george w bush
5251689 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
5251690 respectfully im going to disagree with you on mccain and his service
5251691 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5251692 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5251693 john mccain has never questioned sen obamas patriotism but he clearly does question sen obamas experience and judgment and they do have profound differences of opinion on the best way to reduce our dependence on mideast oil bring jobs back to america and keep our nation safe
5251694 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5251695 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5251696 i think the board here is aggressive in its mission to protect the public certainly
5251697 but i think anybody who looks at the individual facts of those cases wont argue with
5251698 the heroes series has brought some of the worlds most exciting air battles in history to gamers all over the world and heroes over europe builds on the series impressive legacy with highly detailed realistic visual presentation and an even deeper online experience
5251699 transmission games did an incredible job on the first game heroes of the pacific and this second game in the series is definitely benefiting from that experience
5251700 we are very excited to partner with atari to bring this stunning title to gamers worldwide
5251701 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5251702 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5251703 i pray the government stops this down sliding and take the country out of this crisis
5251704 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership
5251705 he knew i was upset after id been to the diary room but he just went to bed in b block with the others since ive been here theres just been these little digs and nasty comments
5251706 ive cooked him dinner like five times which is a lot as hes a chef ive stuck by him through everything and ive had to hear all this crap in the outside world
5251707 if you give something to someone you shouldnt expect something back
5251708 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart
5251709 at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies but then samantha came onto the scene and i was dropped
5251710 being warner predictably the sleeve art is appalling it is the work of cash hounds and i urge people not to buy it i am not signed to warner and no royalties from this dvd will come to me please spend your money elsewhere
5251711 i hope they hurry up and find a cure quick
5251712 i passed the test its actually quite hard to fail i think
5251713 we had what i called a clapham junction day when you know the phones were ringing there were lots of things to do and i was just kind of flat lining almost i just couldnt deal with it and i thought theres more theres more
5251714 its unusual because people deal with me and they refuse to believe i have alzheimers because at the moment i can speak very coherently i can plot a novel
5251715 i type badly if it wasnt for my loss of typing ability i might doubt the fact that i have alzheimers
5251716 its now hunt and peck and there will be a moment sometimes when the letter a just totally vanishes and i dont quite know what happens
5251717 its as if the keyboard closes up and the letter a is not there anymore then ill blink a few times and then the letter a comes back
5251718 the basic test for example will ask you questions like what day of the week is it what is the date i have a pa so there are really only two types of day is my pa in or is my pa out what day of the week is it well if hes not here then its probably the weekend
5251719 one of the questions was how many animals can you name
5251720 my wife said you would pick up the shirt and look at it as if you were looking at some kind of new thing that you had to wear and now you just put it on and just do the buttons up and you dont think about it
5251721 one piece of advice i was given by a specialist was surround yourself with toys he didnt mean buy stuff but try to make your life as interesting as possible keep yourself active keep yourself interested
5251722 my fans across the world started to contact me and in fact the website fell over and it was just getting ridiculous so i sent out a message saying its only worth asking me if you can help if youre a high end brain specialist
5251723 about a dozen or more contacted me saying i dont know about high end but im head of the department of whatever at so and so university
5251724 something like a cure i suspect is in the pipeline but i think its a fairly long pipe so i dont think it will be in time for me one lives in hope
5251725 you get dark days its one step beyond cant find your mobile phone cant find your car keys
5251726 in addition to his bladder his hairstyle and his sense of humour my father willed to me his stoicism
5251727 if theres nothing you can do about something then dont do it you have to learn to program your life around the fact
5251728 for more than a decade the audiences for most traditional news sources have steadily declined as the number of people getting news online has surged
5251729 a sizable minority of americans find themselves at the intersection of these two long standing trends in news consumption
5251730 ja das habe ich gleich gemerkt als ich den laden betreten habe das liegt hier in den r umen deulich sp rbar in der luft
5251731 erkl rte sie und dr ckte ihm einen zettel voller wertvoller informationen ber in die hand
5251732 we took another step forward with the new bike today although i have to say that it has not been easy to get this result
5251733 we came to brno without any test data but the team did a great job with the set up
5251734 you could hear her going on and on because she was standing right behind the stage curtain shes talking and talking meanwhile you have the entire audience waiting almost two hours for the taping to start
5251735 she leaves us waiting and everyone is sitting there complaining and then she comes out and doesnt say a word about it she didnt even say hello she got right into her script
5251736 she had the audience prance down the street and then release black balloons it was so disorganized people fell over the press outside and almost trampled two little girls
5251737 i was having a hard time at school in terms of being c p at everything with no discernible talent
5251738 i sometimes think why oh why has velcro not taken off
5251739 id like to have as many children as my body will allow and id adopt if i still want more after that
5251740 the conventions are an important part of the presidential election process and hp is pleased to partner with both parties for the conventions in 2008 just as we did in 2000 and 2004
5251741 hp is committed to helping this years conventions reduce their environmental impact and to engineering products software and services that help individuals and businesses to do the same
5251742 we believe were able to match brightcove amp maven for the higher end market
5251743 hp continues to distinguish the elitebook brand with sophisticated innovative designs that combine military standard durability with easy to use features and the right levels of performance
5251744 these great looking notebooks can withstand the rigors of the road meet the most demanding tasks and keep up with the ever changing mobile lifestyle
5251745 fergie wont commit to a tour schedule to promote the album
5251746 the person who took the call actually said no i immediately called back and said yes i was damn sure i was going to make it and i did
5251747 i guess now the only person bigger to cook for is the pope
5251748 he was the most gracious warm gentleman you could meet we were just thrilled to have him he was endearing and left a spot in our hearts
5251749 if there are any georgians here come out and we will take you to safety
5251750 i ts possible that georgians may have confused the cheerleading from washington with something else
5251751 you acquire a lot of stuff so i decided to put it on the website mom pulled out some embarrassing stuff but im like just dont pull out my underwear
5251752 she loves the surreal look sound and score and the soundtrack and score will be a theme running throughout the record
5251753 alzheimers is a particularly unpleasant disease i dont know anyone whos got better from alzheimers it strips our humanity a bit at a time until you end up a vegetable
5251754 aricept can slow the diseases progress and costs just 2 50 a day but there are 400 000 alzheimers sufferers in the uk so aricept has been ruled out for nhs use in the mild stages except in scotland
5251755 i have no trouble paying but some people cant my wife and pa noticed changes in me after two months on it i used to fumble with buttons and seat belts now i get dressed normally and seat belts slide in first time mentally its the difference between a sunny day and an overcast day
5251756 alzheimers scares people and at 04 00 in the morning it scares me and aricept is well worth having for the relief that it brings
5251757 i feel particularly angry on behalf of early onset patients because it feels like an insult and the younger you are the more insulting it is
5251758 its probably easier to get drugs off fat charlie round the back of the bus station than it is to get medicines but there we are
5251759 then after the grammys i thought im not going to hear from this dude for the rest of my life
5251760 i kept getting calls from one particular classroom in an outlying school
5251761 the children were having trouble getting the computers to respond to the mice
5251762 sure enough the mice were erratic unless i covered them completely with my hand blocking the direct sunlight
5251763 the excessive light was confusing the photoelectric sensors that translate the x y motion but only on bright sunny days or if they didnt have the blinds closed
5251764 i took the mice disassembled them and coated the inside of the beige plastic with black paint that fixed the problem and we have since replaced the mice with black plastic ones to avoid future calls
5251765 cooks in my restaurant are paid 4 less than other hotels
5251766 were part of the movement for immigrant rights in toronto and the hotel industry
5251767 most days i dont have time to take a break
5251768 hotel occupancy rates were up three per cent in may and another one per cent in june compared to last year
5251769 they provide services to their members money for training culture funds they provide help for the young
5251770 were part of the movement for immigrant rights in toronto and the hotel industry
5251771 seventy per cent of our workers are immigrants to canada
5251772 its sometimes an interesting challenge organizing people from different communities with low union density
5251773 we have to be good at making people absorb the fact that they have rights
5251774 our focus is on developing leadership in the rank and file in every case workers sit on the negotiating committee at every level of negotiations our executive board and solidarity committee works with the community and take on the role of organizer in the workplace
5251775 increasingly we can act on facing problems in the hotels political fights helping our members etc
5251776 local 75 represents 40 hotels in toronto thirty have been negotiated until 2010
5251777 the goal is to have the other 10 negotiated to that date as well
5251778 i think what distinguishes unite here is that the union is not confined to conflicts at the workplace the union has a role in where people live and in communities local 75 is at the forefront in transforming the way a lot of locals are looking at their communities the broader issues are starting to define the union
5251779 the first big meeting of coalition partners was in may 2007 over 600 people came
5251780 everything that the neighbourhood wanted got written into the agreement
5251781 we have a huge shopping list its exhaustive more jobs better services youth services etc
5251782 the summer of hope is a campaign aimed at bringing together members across toronto to fight for the rights of immigrant workers
5251783 there could be some supply disruption issues there so the market is watching this closely
5251784 the market will probably get through this hurricane news pretty quickly
5251785 the number one story in global assets is for now the rise of the dollar index
5251786 since it was a key market input for the upward move of crude oil any further rise in the dollar index should further limit the upside potential for oil

5251792 i really dont know that there are that many people with set hours monday through friday
5251793 but this year im forcing the kids to reuse their backpacks
5251794 they each cost 50 they like the special cool ones and theyre still holding up
5251795 ive got two teenage boys and they like the brand names
5251796 they shant expect that this year were a cheap bunch here at this house anyway

5251802 we can see little flashpoints in gas prices or a spike in joblessness but getting the whole picture is extremely difficult in part because were depending on government collected data which could often be three months later
5251803 is it a housing story is it a gasoline prices story is it an inflation story
5251804 we need to create other listening posts than the treasury department and the bureau of labor statistics
5251805 we can see little flashpoints in gas prices or a spike in joblessness but getting the whole picture is extremely difficult in part because were depending on government collected data which could often be three months later
5251806 is it a housing story is it a gasoline prices story is it an inflation story
5251807 we need to create other listening posts than the treasury department and the bureau of labor statistics
5251808 overall this is a hard story for journalists to tell because it isnt an event it isnt a person
5251809 and yet where they can get a handle on it its a story that people are eager to hear
5251810 political instability in pakistan is not in the interests of pakistan nor the regional or international community
5251811 it is important that the government of pakistan now moves with purpose to tackle the security and economic challenges facing the country
5251812 i understand the difficulties of this passing but its the only game in town now this will be the centerpiece of what is debated when we come back in session
5251813 i know that sounds a little corny in todays age but a lot of us forget that not everybody in the senate is that well briefed on energy
5251814 we encouraged that it be closed to the media but it wont be most senators in hearings like this are really speaking to the public they arent speaking to each other
5251815 we knew party leaders in essence were using the issue to their advantage not trying to solve the problem
5251816 leaders were also trying to protect their presidential candidates republican john mccain and democrat barack obama trying to keep votes from occurring that might hurt their particular candidates
5251817 in the atmosphere were operating in right now in the senate theres no way a bill is going to pass with anwr in it
5251818 i didnt think it was appropriate for us to come home for five weeks when the major issue in our country was energy and we had done nothing on it i would be stunned if democratic house speaker nancy pelosi agreed to come back in so that would be a victory for republicans
5251819 and hope does not disappoint us because god has poured out his love into our hearts by the holy spirit whom he has given us you see at just the right time when we were still powerless christ died for the ungodly very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die but god demonstrates his own love for us in this while we were still sinners christ died for us since we have now been justified by his blood how much more shall we be saved from gods wrath through him for if when we were gods enemies we were reconciled to him through the death of his son how much more having been reconciled shall we be saved through his life

5251825 its not who you are that holds you back its who you think youre not
5251826 this replaces the existing service where internal limits that determined whether we bounced or paid an item were not made available to the customer its just customers will now be able to see clearly how this works
5251827 ultimately it is a safety net and we do think people will run their accounts responsibly but there are occasions when something doesnt quite work out and flexibility is necessary for customers to get payments made this just gives them peace of mind a five day period to sort it out at a reasonable fee of 22
5251828 the problem with both overdrafts and credit cards are that they are amongst the most expensive way to borrow money so unless it is for short term clearing balances every month for example it is not an efficient way to borrow and actually prolonged use will make the problem worse and worse as more charges and high interest kicks in
5251829 if you do use an overdraft agree a limit with the bank and this should work out cheaper than unauthorised borrowing or credit card debit where interest rates typically exceed 20

5251838 i dont know if it was beginning to tell but there was pressure there on us getting goals
5251839 but we always knew that it would come eventually and were just delighted to get three today
5251840 they were just congratulating each other as we were just delighted to get the win and looking forward to next week
5251841 we always knew we could do it we had been creating chances during pre season but they just didnt go in so we are just delighted that they went in today
5251842 weve just got to look forward take every game as they come and get as many three points as we did today
5251843 they fletcher and nish read each others game really well they link up brilliantly so im sure they will get a few more goals between them throughout the season

5251847 theres no doubt ill always make myself available to help anybody else but in that sense winning a couple of majors may make people seek advice from me during that week
5251848 we remain bitterly disappointed at the manner in which sonny bill deserted his team mates and his supporters
5251849 we have however reached the point where we need to get on with business and we have withdrawn the injunction against him playing for any other club
5251850 neither the bulldogs nor sonny bill have anything further to gain by drawing this situation out any further
5251851 for that reason we have accepted a significant compensation payout from sonny bill and a commitment that he not play for any other nrl club until his contract was due to expire at the end of the 2012 season
5251852 i was happy with his run it being only his third run there were horses with plenty of experience in the race and he gave me a really good feel
5251853 the ground was very very testing and i think he will be able to build on that performance
5251854 id say i was actually going better than king of rome three furlongs out hes very very genuine but inexperience and the heavy ground a combination of both caught him out
5251855 i was pleased with him and id say hell improve from the outing hes a great pedigree he was weak as a two year old and didnt run but i think hes about 16 hands and three
5251856 hes very big has always worked very well at home and aidan has just been taking his time with him he thinks there will be a bit there later on
5251857 im pleased to get out on my own and start playing
5251858 ive wanted the chance to play in the spl for a couple of seasons now and im just delighted to be here and playing
5251859 hes hard to play against hes a small guy who is very strong and if you get to tight he can turn you very easily
5251860 he kept me on my toes as hes a very good player

5251875 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5251876 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5251877 i wouldnt say theres a humanitarian catastrophe but theres an urgent need for primary products

5251887 ultimately this is a highly sensitive process where it is easy to fall foul of the legislation
5251888 yo habr a preferido empezar con una victoria pero el empate fue un resultado justo los jugadores que acudieron a la uefa euro 2008 tm no est n al 100 por cien pero veo a mi equipo en los entrenamientos cada d a mejor necesitamos alg n tiempo para llegar a nuestro mejor nivel pero llegar nuestro momento
5251889 fue un partido espectacular y un gran comienzo para m y para m equipo
5251890 estoy muy decepcionado hemos hecho un partido convincente con un buen f tbol mi equipo crey en s mismo hasta el final y el resultado m s justo hubiera sido un empate a tres pero comenzamos en casa y no ganamos y estamos sin puntos esto es malo

5251894 es fant stico ver a los aficionados apoy ndonos cantando y disfrutando del f tbol
5251895 you must let go of your anger to die happily
5251896 ik herinner me nog goed de dag dat de russische strijdkrachten ons dorp binnenkwamen vijftien jaar terug ze staken de huizen in brand en deden vreselijke dingen met zwangere vrouwen
5251897 ik zag hoe soldaten het kind van een hoogzwangere vrouw uit haar baarmoeder haalden en met het hoofdje voetbalden
5251898 ik vrees dat ze dood zijn ik raakte ze onderweg kwijt
5251899 de russen bombardeerden mijn dorp en ik zag dat wel vijf of zes mensen omkwamen
5251900 ik zag mijn 15 jarige neefje dood op straat liggen maar ik had geen tijd om hem te begraven
5251901 het waren veertig soldaten ze reden wat rond en keerden daarna weer terug naar hun posities
5251902 het christelijk geloof is heel belangrijk voor mij maar ik merk dat ook steeds meer mensen nu bidden
5251903 ja sorry ik ben bang voor de russen ik heb al de russische televisie aangezet zodat ze weten dat ik niet tegen hen ben
5251904 ik heb duizenden dollars moeten lenen van de bank om mijn business te beginnen
5251905 al maanden waarschuwden wij dat rusland een invasie aan het voorbereiden was ze zoeken naar een reden zoals in afghanistan tsjechoslowakije en hongarije

5251907 if the supreme court can jail innocent citizens like mr tsikata then nobodys safe in this country
5251908 how did the police know judgment would be passed on the said day
5251909 injustice to any citizen is injustice among the whole global community
5251910 were raw in some positions but it was a good test
5251911 we saw what we need to work on and what we did well
5251912 nog een laatste oproep aan het boic de volgorde van onze 4x100 meter ploeg is verkeerd
5251913 oh that you would bless me indeed and enlarge my territory that your hand be with me that you would keep me from evil that i may not cause pain
5251914 this is an abuse of the rights of the many people engaged in fishing since their fundamental right to work is being taken away
5251915 we are happy that parliament has done its duty and we commend the members of parliament mps for that and with this approval we will get money for gt to grow
5251916 with a multinational like vodafone we will get money to buy new equipment and negotiate for good prices in the market
5251917 londoners have so far been largely insulated from the price falls taking place elsewhere in the country
5251918 however sellers who choose to come to the market during the peak holiday season generally have a greater need to sell and as a result properties coming onto the market in july were on average 21 000 cheaper than last month
5251919 areas that are about to benefit from improved transport links appear to be avoiding the worst of the storm that is setting in elsewhere in the capital
5251920 when looking at trends in the market it is important to remember that uk house prices are significantly higher than five years ago
5251921 the current issue affecting the market is largely about the supply of credit a very different situation to the early 90s which was about high interest rates and unemployment the fundamentals underpinning the market remain sound with long term demand for housing low interest rates and low unemployment
5251922 about 60 per cent of worldwide unsafe abortions are performed on african women under the age of 25
5251923 for pi our ultimate satisfaction will be not only to see the number of pac clients increase but also to see the numbers eventually reduced
5251924 unsafe abortion is the fourth highest cause of maternal mortality
5251925 in west africa a study conducted in 2000 estimated 30 per cent of unsafe abortions in ghana we have up to 30 per cent two in five unsafe abortions occur among women under 25 years
5251926 i will say that the choice of dr bawumia three months to a general election would not favour the npp it could actually be detrimental
5251927 the choice of dr bawumia does not do that while the choice of mahama does that for the ndc
5251928 we have a flag bearer who goes out on his own no problem we have a running mate who has demonstrated clearly that he can go out on his own in any region of the country and get the reaction that you would expect even of a presidential candidate

5251930 a government of dfp will protect local industries to create jobs for the youth
5251931 our quarterly economic forecast highlights a significant worsening in uk economic prospects there is now a distinct possibility of technical recession the level of uk unemployment is likely to increase to nearly 300 000 over the next few years reaching almost two million an increase above two million cannot be ruled out
5251932 our view is that the threats to growth are more serious and more immediate than the risks of higher inflation
5251933 the uk economy urgently needs an interest rate cut to counter threats of recession
5251934 whilst a marked slowdown in activity is likely over the next 18 months even if interest rates are cut when inflation peaks the correct policy decisions are still needed to ward off the threats of a serious and prolonged recession the longer the mpc waits before cutting rates the bigger the danger that the economic situation would deteriorate

5251940 bumblebees are known to feed from aphid secretions and from extra floral nectaries on unlikely plants like bracken but its more usual to see it in upland areas where there are few other flowers around
5251941 the fact that it is now frequently observed elsewhere may suggest that there are fewer of the right sorts of flowers around in peoples gardens and in the wider countryside
5251942 bumblebees have struggled in recent decades from habitat loss three species are extinct in the uk and many more are threatened so perhaps bumblebees are having to find innovative ways of finding food
5251943 although the aphid secretions provide them with a sugary solution a substitute for nectar they provide no protein
5251944 bumblebees can only get their protein from pollen which they feed to their growing young so it is essential for a healthy population
5251945 ants often protect the aphids from other predators such as ladybirds and in return they take the honey dew secreted by the aphids
5251946 there is a fine balance to be struck in the garden the answer is to put plants in the garden that are of benefit to bees

5251969 although we are faced with a problem of rehabilitation and rescue there is no cause for panic
5251970 despite the propaganda of our rivals it is not to be disputed that the overwhelming majority of ghanaians now appreciate the fact that the npp represents their best hope for our nations political economic and social transformation
5251971 refrain from any act that will in any way jeopardize the peoples widespread good will and focus attention on winning the elections cleanly and fairly and transparently to reinforce the pace setter role that the npp administration has earned for ghana
5251972 we must not fail ourselves we must not fail africa we must not fail people of goodwill around the world who have put their faith in ghana
5251973 we have a lot going for us we have the solid track record to drive us to victory in the december elections

5251985 ninety years after survivors encountered the 1918 pandemic influenza virus we collected antibody producing b cells from them and successfully isolated b cells that produce antibodies that block the viral infection
5251986 the antibodies produced by these cells demonstrated remarkable power to block 1918 flu virus infection in mice proving that even nine decades after infection with this virus survivors retain protection from it
5251987 our findings show that survivors of the pandemic have highly effective virus neutralising antibodies to this powerful virus and humans can sustain circulating b memory cells to viruses for up to nine decades after exposure

5251997 every time we went to britain we felt looser could say different things talk about cooler stuff
5251998 we could be randier we could be 19 or 20 year old guys instead of squeaky clean pop stars people are more open in the uk the fact that you can open page three in the newspaper and theres a topless girl that kind of sets the tone
5251999 british fans are the most frenetic funny witty very unlike america youre being swarmed by 20 000 girls and a fan in london will say donnie when you sang that song it meant a lot to me while ripping your clothes off its charming
5252000 i was diagnosed with add twice i didnt believe the first doctor who told me and i had a whole theory that add was just something they invented to make you pay for medicine but then the second doctor told me i had it

5252035 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5252036 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5252037 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5252038 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5252039 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5252054 i struggle to play my best golf when theres no pressure
5252055 the next level for me is about accepting im a three time major winner taking the confidence from that and that will help me in tournaments so i dont have to put myself through the mill
5252056 theres no doubt ill always make myself available to help anybody else but in that sense winning a couple of majors may make people seek advice from me during that week
5252057 i dont know if it was beginning to tell but there was pressure there on us getting goals
5252058 but we always knew that it would come eventually and were just delighted to get three today
5252059 they were just congratulating each other as we were just delighted to get the win and looking forward to next week
5252060 we always knew we could do it we had been creating chances during pre season but they just didnt go in so we are just delighted that they went in today
5252061 weve just got to look forward take every game as they come and get as many three points as we did today
5252062 they fletcher and nish read each others game really well they link up brilliantly so im sure they will get a few more goals between them throughout the season
5252063 i was happy with his run it being only his third run there were horses with plenty of experience in the race and he gave me a really good feel
5252064 the ground was very very testing and i think he will be able to build on that performance
5252065 id say i was actually going better than king of rome three furlongs out hes very very genuine but inexperience and the heavy ground a combination of both caught him out
5252066 i was pleased with him and id say hell improve from the outing hes a great pedigree he was weak as a two year old and didnt run but i think hes about 16 hands and three
5252067 hes very big has always worked very well at home and aidan has just been taking his time with him he thinks there will be a bit there later on
5252068 we remain bitterly disappointed at the manner in which sonny bill deserted his team mates and his supporters
5252069 we have however reached the point where we need to get on with business and we have withdrawn the injunction against him playing for any other club
5252070 neither the bulldogs nor sonny bill have anything further to gain by drawing this situation out any further
5252071 for that reason we have accepted a significant compensation payout from sonny bill and a commitment that he not play for any other nrl club until his contract was due to expire at the end of the 2012 season

5252073 1 3 gegen den vfb stuttgart im ersten spiel nach der bundesliga r ckkehr wie haben sie die partie gesehen
5252074 das war ein absolut verdienter sieg f r den vfb stuttgart wir haben vor allem in der ersten halbzeit lehrgeld gezahlt auch wenn wir selbst gute chancen hatten das 0 1 ist ungl cklich weil zu diesem zeitpunkt sascha r sler verletzt au erhalb behandelt wird da sind wir dann im mittelfeld nicht mehr organisiert beim 0 2 geben wir den ball an der grundlinie her das darf nicht passieren und auch beim 0 3 sind wir in der vorw rtsbewegung die beiden treffer haben uns gezeigt dass in dieser liga jeder kleine fehler bestraft wird
5252075 war ihre abwehr noch nicht auf das tempo in der bundesliga eingestellt
5252076 die beiden tore haben nichts mit umschalten zu tun bei solchen fehlern hat es die verteidigung nat rlich sehr schwer stuttgart hat heute super umgeschaltet wir haben es nicht gut genug gemacht und m ssen daran in den n chsten tagen und wochen weiter hart arbeiten wir wissen dass wir noch zulegen m ssen im abwehrverhalten und im umschalten von offensive auf defensive
5252077 wir hatten vorne einige chancen auch direkt nach der pause eine hundertprozentige wenn man die vergibt rgert man sich nat rlich aber dass wir uns viele torchancen erspielt haben ist positiv und nicht aus jeder chance wird ein tor aber wir haben uns nicht aufgegeben das ist eine gute eine wichtige charaktereigenschaft wir haben voll auf risiko gespielt und wollten das spiel irgendwie drehen leider haben wir es nicht mehr geschafft das 2 3 zu machen und f r noch mehr spannung zu sorgen
5252078 wie haben sie die leistung ihres torh ters christofer heimeroth gesehen

5252088 it was very surprising that these subjects would still have cells floating in their blood so long afterward
5252089 the antibodies that we isolated are remarkable antibodies they grab onto the virus very tightly and they virtually never fall off
5252090 that allows them to kill the 1918 virus with extreme potency meaning it takes a very small amount of antibody
5252091 the thought is the first influenza that you see during life is the one that you have the best immunity to

5252213 we found an interesting pathway to conduct different types of chemical reactions between complex molecules and substrates that will potentially enable us to prepare materials that cannot be made by standard methods
5252214 we hope to conduct lots of chemistry on the thin films

5252332 i do not feel we should forfeit the traditional rights and privileges of the natives of our islands for a mere thimbleful of votes in congress that we the lovers of hawaii from long association with it should sacrifice our birthright for the greed of alien desires to remain on our shores

5252334 human beings make a terrible fuss about a lot of things but none more than romance eating and drinking are just as important for keeping the species going more so actually since a celibate person can at least continue living but a starving person cant yet while we may build whole institutions around the simple ritual of eating it never turns us flat out nuts romance does

5252391 russia has shown us once again how much scorn it has for western style democracy let us therefore
5252392 it is about russia resurgent and nationalistic pushing its way back into the caucasus
5252393 suspend the nato russia council established in 2002 to help bring russia closer to the west make clear that dissolution will follow suspension the council gives russia a seat at the nato table message invading neighbouring democracies forfeits the seat bar russian entry to the world trade organisation dissolve the g 8 putins dictatorial presence long made it a farce but no one wanted to upset the bear by expelling it no need to the seven democracies simply withdraw then immediately announce the reconstitution of the original g 7 and announce a us european boycott of the 2014 winter olympics at sochi
5252394 all of these steps except dissolution of the g 8 which should be irreversible would be subject to reconsideration depending upon russian action most importantly and minimally its withdrawal of troops from georgia proper to south ossetia and abkhazia the most crucial and unconditional measure however is this reaffirming support for the saakashvili government and declaring its removal by the russians would lead to recognition of a government in exile this would instantly be understood as providing us the legal basis for supplying and supporting a georgian resistance to any russian installed regime

5252399 one of the more influential and original voices on american foreign policy and politics
5252400 poorly thought through badly implemented and has produced many unintended costs that will linger for years if not decades
5252401 in the past few years many of these policies have been modified abandoned or reversed
5252402 the embrace of torture and other extralegal methods has violated americas noblest traditions and provided little in return
5252403 examine the bush administrations policies as they stand in january 2009 not as they were earlier
5252404 if i could change one thing about american foreign policy what would it be the answer is easy but its not something most of us think of as foreign policy i would adopt a serious national program geared toward energy efficiency and independence reducing our dependence on oil would be the single greatest multiplier of american power in the world
5252405 the greens at fox run immediately grabbed eds eye for its potential to become a practical model for other builders to follow
5252406 its been interesting to hear his so filled with passion for the subject yet maintains a great sense of humor
5252407 what really caught eds attention was the greens status as the first community its size to use certified green building
5252408 our english style cottages are nearly 400 percent more energy efficient than other homes their size
5252409 heres the best part eds planning a trip to st louis to help us get the word out about this truly unique community
5252410 the people treated us wonderfully it seems like a long time ago now

5252424 heres a woman thats successful takes care of herself looks amazing and she took the steps to get there it doesnt happen unless you take charge shes a great role model for many many women
5252425 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me
5252426 i was in high school when she hit it big
5252427 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
5252428 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s madonna is proof that exercising and eating right at an early age pays off
5252429 i want to know who her doctor is its really hard to believe shes 50 she looks 40 and she just keeps going at it living life and loving life
5252430 put a picture of a 50 year old woman today next to one from my mothers generation
5252431 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
5252432 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
5252433 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
5252434 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
5252435 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
5252436 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now
5252437 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself

5252460 fatigued depressed mood low sex drive could be your testosterone is running on empty
5252461 identify the men in your practice with low testosterone who may benefit from clinical performance in a packet
5252462 now if i had a magic wand and i could do anything for you what would it be
5252463 there is an excellent chance that giving you testosterone will help to restore your energy and in terms of being foggy i cant promise but i have several men in my practice who are professors they take testosterone and they say it makes their brains much sharper
5252464 ill give you a prescription now and you can get started once we complete these tests
5252465 i used to be able to play racquetball non stop but im tired now after four games
5252466 but my primary care doctor checked my testosterone and said it was 800 which is normal he told me he couldnt do anything about my problem
5252467 if i had a magic wand and i could do anything for you what would it be
5252468 well i believe we have a very good chance of helping you
5252469 well check your p s a today but we dont need to do biopsies of your prostate gland until after the age of fifty so you can get started right away
5252470 were not sure what andropause is the intention was that androgel would be for people with conditions like klinefelters and pituitary dysfunction
5252471 we measured the size of their testes evaluated body hair erectile function sperm count muscle mass bone density pituitary function
5252472 these men were completely normal from every parameter and it was incredible fifteen per cent had testosterone levels during the day that were well below what is set as the lower limit of normal more than fifty per cent below the cutoff
5252473 there can be a funny disconnect between one measurement and a later one
5252474 this variability in testosterone levels was really a physiological curiosity until androgel was approved
5252475 now every time the testosterone level is below 300 the question of prescription is raised
5252476 frankly i dont know where that number comes from or how real it is
5252477 practicing doctors have a great belief in the numbers but in the past few years the assays have deteriorated
5252478 the tests arent as reliable as we want them to be but it doesnt matter
5252479 its not credible that we arent helping these men by giving them testosterone the truth is theres a deep emotional issue in some people who oppose hormone replacement therapy because it asks the question is there hope of achieving eternal youth there are those who dont want to oppose mother nature
5252480 there appears to be a threshold level of testosterone below which libido and sexual function are impaired
5252481 boosting above this threshold doesnt seem to enhance sexual performance
5252482 just because you are increasing bone density doesnt mean you prevent fractures
5252483 each pharmaceutical company wants to get up and say this is the magic bullet for aging
5252484 but its overly simplistic to attribute such a complex process as aging to the change in the level of a single hormone like estrogen or testosterone
5252485 i agree that currently there are insufficient data on the long term effects of testosterone replacement therapy on the heart or on the development of prostate cancer but the benefits seem considerable
5252486 if the answer is yes that replacement therapy causes heart damage or sparks emergence of prostate cancer then you will know in six years or so
5252487 but older people in this age group wont wait six to ten years to have solid answers clinical practice will move at one rate and the data will trail
5252488 maybe were meant to lower our testosterone levels maybe its healthy and protects us from developing prostate cancer of course thats pure conjecture but its something that needs to be carefully addressed
5252489 i worry that this widespread prescription of testosterone for aging men is going to precipitate an epidemic of prostate cancer
5252490 through the approach to business unusual we need to address the unmanageable through mitigation and unavoidable through adaptation

5252523 exports are the bright spot this year in an otherwise bleak economy but the world is not suddenly snapping up made in america goods like aircraft machinery and staplers the great attraction is decidedly low luster commodities like corn wheat ore and scrap metal
5252524 commodity sales have been helped greatly this year by rising prices particularly for grains and also by the decline in the value of the dollar which reduces the cost of american exports in other currencies both trends however have recently reversed suggesting that the rise in commodity sales will not be sustained and that exports might shrink weakening the economy another notch
5252525 an analysis of trade data by the federal bureau of economic analysis illustrates just how lopsided the gains have been between manufactured goods and unprocessed commodities
5252526 all exports of goods and services in the first half of the year rose at a 52 billion annual rate adjusted for inflation up 7
5252527 such unevenness favoring commodities is unusual given that manufactured products even by this definition account for 40 percent of the nations exports while commodities make up only 26 percent and services 30 percent indeed not since the bureau began compiling detailed trade data in 1977 have commodities outpaced manufactured exports for two consecutive quarters
5252528 the hardins john hardin jr and his son david who farm near indianapolis indiana have every acre of their mostly rented land planted with corn soybeans and wheat devoting more acreage to corn in anticipation of huge demand
5252529 we were in a situation where there wasnt enough corn in the world to go around john hardin said noting that damaged harvests in other countries had pushed up the price the weak dollar also made american corn more attractive
5252530 but even with both of those props disappearing the hardins are betting heavily on corn again next year because of its use in ethanol and because of rising demand for livestock feed in india and china where a rapidly growing middle class increasingly wants meat in its daily diet
5252531 we may be addicted to oil from saudia arabia and russia but they cant get enough of our milk fat products
5252532 exports of butter shot up 570 percent to more than 56 000 tons led by sales to russia and saudi arabia cheese exports jumped 48 percent to roughly 78 000 tons
5252533 the federal government doesnt report export data by state but theres little doubt the california dairy business is cashing in on the boom the state produced 500 million pounds of butter and 2 3 billion pounds of cheese last year thats far more than californians consume so dairy processors get much of their revenue from out of state sales
5252534 just a couple of months ago policy makers were alarmed about how far the dollar had fallen now evidence is building that its seven year slide may be ending
5252535 the dollars latest rise is closely tied to recent declines in oil and other commodity prices
5252536 oil fell 1 24 a barrel friday closing at 113 77 in new york trading
5252537 the markets now recognize that commodity linked price inflation due to a weak dollar and a strong global economy is yesterdays worry says robert barbera chief economist of investment technology group inc
5252538 several economists said friday it was too soon to declare the u s export boom over
5252539 moreover some economists see more room for growth in exports to developing countries in a report friday alliancebernstein economist joseph carson estimated that emerging markets are worth 10 trillion and are growing at a 5 annual rate which could help keep the export boom going if at a slower pace
5252540 the u s announced friday plans to host the latest round of high level trade talks with china next month
5252541 u s trade representative susan schwab and secretary of commerce carlos gutierrez will hold the 19th session of the u s china joint commission on commerce and trade or jcct in yorba linda calif secretary of agriculture edward schafer will also take part in the two day talks at the nixon library scheduled to start sept 15
5252542 trade relations between the two economic rivals continue to be marked by a combination of conflict and cooperation at the semi annual strategic economic dialogue in june held in annapolis md the two sides agreed to launch talks on a bilateral investment agreement
5252543 however the bush administration has continued to impose trade duties and file world trade organization cases against china while trying to keep congressional efforts to pass more punitive trade remedies at bay
5252544 we have a strong interest in working with china to address the wide range of trade and economic issues that affect the lives of american workers businesses and farmers said gutierrez
5252545 the collapse of the doha round of global tariff reduction negotiations means that free trade is likely to advance if at all only through bilateral and regional agreements
5252546 the problem is politics as president bush witnessed firsthand during his recent stopover in seoul nationalist opposition to greater trade with the united states still roils south korea l
5252547 now it is up to national legislatures to ratify the pact in south koreas national assembly mr lees party enjoys a majority and the deal was negotiated when the current opposition was in government so approval seems likely the u s congress is another story senate finance committee chairman max baucus d mont declared in april that he would not permit consideration of the pact until all cuts of u s beef from all ages of u s cattle make it onto korean supermarket shelves his office informs us that the recent compromise has not changed his view mr baucus had a right to protest south koreas irrational resistance to beef imports especially since it harmed cattle producers in his state but mr baucus ought to show at least as much flexibility as that shown by the u s beef industry which he is ostensibly defending
5252548 over the last several years these wto talks have become more about protectionism than about opening markets and freeing up trade
5252549 from the outset developing countries were allowed to reduce their tariffs by substantially smaller percentages than developed economies
5252550 these talks started out based on the premise that underdeveloped countries would be allowed to protect a limited number of their products from tariff reductions
5252551 so where can we go from here simply picking up where the talks left off is a recipe for failure the next time we take up these conversations all parties need to start with the fundamental premise that the goal of negotiators is to increase opportunities for trade not protectionism
5252552 this tiny outpost of radical thinking is an excellent vantage point for the recent collapse of the multilateral trade negotiations hong kong is essentially irrelevant to trade talks because it practices unilateral free trade with virtually no tariffs or other barriers people here understand that imports exports and the rigors of comparative advantage create individual opportunity and wealth enough in hong kongs case for it to have evolved under almost pure free trade from a rocky harbor into one of the wealthiest places on earth
5252553 few places practice unilateral free trade but one reason the failure of the recent trade negotiations hasnt been bigger news is the less well understood point that some of the most important industries in the world live in their own version of a free trading hong kong
5252554 the global information and technology industries in particular have thrived in nearly hong kong like conditions trade barriers are rare issues certainly compared with industries such as autos steel and farming
5252555 even if the doha round is resuscitated the language of trade as a negotiation among countries is now part of the problem support even for bilateral agreements has waned with congress holding up agreements with countries such as south korea and colombia
5252556 the august crop report from the department of agriculture was welcome news for many farmers feedlot operators food manufacturers and grocery shoppers it indicated a sunnier outlook than had been expected after a wet june
5252557 the report accelerated the recent price drop for several key commodities which should help alleviate but certainly wont end the world food prices crisis
5252558 but one need not look worldwide to feel the effects a trip to the corner grocery store will do the bumper crop should help tamp down food prices and not a moment too soon thursdays labor department report showed consumer price inflation at the highest level since 1991 with food rising at an annual rate of 5 8 percent partly due to farmers dependent on feed for pork poultry and beef production having been hit hard by high grain prices
5252559 the candy maker hershey said on friday that it was raising prices in the united states by roughly 10 percent and warned that the higher cost of ingredients like cocoa corn sweetener sugar and peanuts would weigh on profits
5252560 food makers have been raising prices as commodity costs climb for the first seven months of this year prices in american grocery stores have risen nearly 6 percent
5252561 hersheys price increase is effective immediately and should help offset rising commodity costs which the company expects will more than double from 2008 to 2009
5252562 samsung has announced the latest model in its lineup of eco phones one of the dozens of new electronics products from manufacturers striving to be green samsung says the new phone is made in ways that cut down on the use of environmentally harmful materials and is packaged in recycled materials but what really makes this model different is that its case is made of bioplastic with materials extracted from corn
5252563 unfortunately samsungs new cellphone relies on a flawed equation corn equals green it is really time to throw out this formula for good
5252564 bioplastic also creates another market for corn a much smaller market than the ethanol market but growing nonetheless new industrial demands for corn are driving up world food prices and are increasing the pressure to convert more nonagricultural land to corn production
5252565 this fall were getting up to speed in understanding the organization of the usda he said of the ag panel now doing oversight work basically were doing are homework on how the department is operating and how theyre structured
5252566 when we get a new president one of my priorities next year is to do a reorganization of usda
5252567 yeah the house phone your cell daddy tried calling i tried calling why didnt you pick up
5252568 daddy wanted to know which slr you wanted he was so close to getting you a 40d
5252569 yeah he thought of getting that slr and giving your 400d to me
5252570 yeah but as usual mummy butted in so it was a no go
5252571 were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government i should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter but i should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them
5252572 bernanke tries to define what institutions fed could let fail
5252573 it started in north america and spread to europe the economic difficulties are now showing up in some of the developing countries as well
5252574 people are eating more sandwiches in puerto rico and relying more on private label products in the uk customers in many areas are buying cheaper cuts of meat for dinner and similar to the us people in other countries are eliminating vactions and entertaining more at home
5252575 would give us the opportunity to participate in things that will benefit wal mart long term
5252576 can include taking pictures or taking notes the definition is very broad
5252577 its unclear who is actually in charge and whose rules apply to the information thats being collected and shared and distributed through these fusion centers
5252578 beyond normal law enforcement functions and start becoming intelligence collectors against protest groups the reports that we obtained make clear that there was no indication of any sort of criminal activity and yet that investigation went on for 14 months and these reports were uploaded into a federal database when all these agencies are authorized to go out and start collecting this information and putting it in areas where its accessible by the intelligence community its a very dangerous proposition for our democracy
5252579 reinvest their police budget toward real community security new elementary schools health care for the uninsured providing clean renewable energy
5252580 our taxpayer dollars went to pay people to infiltrate and take notes on our meetings and its absolutely enraging a lot of this homeland security funding is an absolute sham its being used to actually crush dissent not to keep us safer in any real way
5252581 in the last historical battle it was to wage anarchism was to see all the ideological sauce that comprised its being fall back into its face state freedom individual and other musty ingredients with capital letters while the libertarian militias workers and peasants were saving its honor making the greatest practical contribution ever to the international proletarian movement burning churches fighting on all fronts against the bourgeoisie fascism and stalinism and beginning to create a truly communist society
5252582 for franco to be defeated first companys and caballero had to be defeated for fascism to be wiped out first the bourgeoisie and its stalinist and socialist allies had to be crushed the capitalist state had to be destroyed from top to bottom and workers power based on rank and file committees be installed antifascist unity has just been submission to the bourgeoisie
5252583 we wanted to do something extra something that makes an impact on society
5252584 carnegie mellon was the perfect environment where one could come up with an innovative solution to make this kind of impact
5252585 he had done the right thing in the war against injustice in the world
5252586 should we ignore it negotiate with it contain it or defeat it
5252587 i think it has to be confronted it has to be confronted squarely and one of the things that i strongly believe is that you know we are not going to as individuals erase evil from the world that is gods task but we can be soldiers in that process and we can confront it when we see it
5252588 the one thing that i think is very important is for us to have some humility in how we approach the issue of confronting evil but you know a lot of evil has been perpetrated based on the claim that we were trying to confront evil just because we think our intentions are good doesnt always mean that were going to be doing good
5252589 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5252590 number one whenever we define a preventable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or other elements in the constitution what we are saying is in fact they are persons entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a a child a nine month old that was delivered to term that determination then essentially if it were accepted by a court would forbid abortions to take place i mean it it would bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow someone to kill a child
5252591 well i believe life begins whenever the mother decides it does
5252592 a union is between man and woman between one man and one woman
5252593 whatever you do for the least of my brother you do for me
5252594 theres a pervasive sense i think that this country as wealthy and powerful as we are still dont spend enough time thinking about the least of these
5252595 it is this world a world where cruise ships throw away more food in a day than most residents of port au prince see in a year where white folks greed runs a world in need apartheid in one hemisphere apathy in another hemisphere thats the world on which hope sits
5252596 ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country
5252597 im now in tottenham but no one can disagree with me wanting to follow my dream
5252598 we are speaking to southampton and we have agreed a deal with them

5252659 in the eyes of other world leaders the rulers of malaysia are undemocratic when you still have a law like the internal security act isa why ask about democracy other leaders feel the same way as me in that it is impossible that anwar would have committed such a crime as such these allegations have got to be false i have advised anwar against swearing upon the quran to prove his innocence as it was unislamic
5252660 i am appalled that many malaysian muslims are calling for anwar to debase himself to the same sewer level as saiful by swearing on the quran
5252661 ive known anwar for more than 15 years and he is a man of integrity it is impossible that he would have committed a crime such as sodomy
5252662 were not saying we believe in sasquatch but if anyones ever going to capture an image of one were guessing itll be a hunter with a trail camera thats why bushnell is offering a chance at 1 000 000 to the first person using one who snaps a verifiable photo of the beast

5252665 the delay in the itc investment tax credit renewal has meant that large commercial jobs are being postponed
5252666 because they dont want to give the democratic congress any credit
5252667 many of these commercial projects are in important planning stages right now and the overall industry is at the tipping point that will lead to widespread adoption
5252668 the absence of the itc will kill most if not all of this growing momentum we need only look to the interruption of tax credits for the wind industry for an example of something that we do not want to repeat this would be a real shame
5252669 over the longer term however the united states commercial market is far too important to be ignored
5252670 a consistent itc policy extending over several years that allows industry to grow and flourish is critical to the industry
5252671 the itc has become a very politicized issue however and its possible that approval could extend into 2009

5252678 at the last moment the english estate agents announced that i had to pay their 3 per cent fee on top of the usual buying costs which id calculated as 19 000 they had split the sale with a spanish agent and the vendor and i each paid one agents fees but no one had warned me about this
5252679 on the day of completion after being assured there was enough money to cover all costs the bank asked me for another 4 200
5252680 the whole process has been distressing and i find the bank intimidating no one will explain to me what all these charges are
5252681 to add insult to injury every time they send me a statement twice a month my spanish bank charges me postage
5252682 countries of french legal origin have significantly higher transaction costs about 14 2 per cent of the property value than countries with german english or scandinavian origins
5252683 most people havent sent money abroad before and arent aware that brokers offer far better rates than banks
5252684 its always worth negotiating with the bank before you make the instruction

5252703 we had put forth a very good contract offer that included substantial pay raises
5252704 it is very disappointing not only that the employees turned down the contract but that they chose to engage in this illegal job action as we had already agreed to continue working with their union toward a new labor contract

5252755 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5252756 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared

5252801 this is a staggering but not unbelievable result when one considers all of diseases in the world that cannot currently be attributed to a specific origin
5252802 you basically have to be in certain places to inhale transient gas phase radicals

5252810 its phenomenal yesterday i was pretty down after the first couple of rounds i was mainly disappointed because i didnt want to let these guys down i was on the back foot a bit because it was a tough day the day before
5252811 but these guys sacrificed a lot its just fantastic to be part of this team weve come a long way in four years and to put a time like that on the board is phenomenal really
5252812 i set out to do that i believed i could do it but to put it into practice is another thing its such a relief when you do it and cross the line
5252813 we were just rattling round it was so smooth it felt easy to be honest as we got closer and knew wed won morale went up and we were just chasing them

5252867 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5252868 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5252869 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5252870 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5252871 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5252872 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5252873 were incredibly fortunate to have pete geren secretary of the u s army and general george casey chief of staff of the u s army join us via phone for the bloggers roundtable panel
5252874 i value the diary tremendously but im scared stiff its going to get lost
5252875 the army does not routinely monitor blogs regarding postings of specific personnel or groups of personnel it is not standard practice for the military to target or single out individual military blogs unless a particular blog has been brought to the attention of the chain of command or other dod department of defense officials for gross opsec operational security violations
5252876 the success of that is what will be the turning point for the soldiers to come home the faster we reconstruct the faster the soldiers can come back
5252877 there are instantaneous communications taking place around the world and we need to figure out how to take advantage of that opportunity instead of looking at it as a nemesis

5252925 despite general caution in estimating the growth outlook for the euro zone inflation expectations of market participants according to surveys and financial market data have been higher of late than can be reconciled with price stability over the long run
5252926 the fact that the pace of growth is likely to slow does not mean that this will be enough to counteract stability concerns nor will it automatically balance out inflationary pressures
5252927 its the duty of monetary policy to prevent increased price risks from translating into a long lasting higher inflation rate

5252932 oracle is pleased to welcome activestate to the oracle partnernetwork
5252933 we are extremely concerned to hear about goods shrinking in size without shrinking in price as it cheats unsuspecting shoppers already under financial pressure from rising household and motoring costs
5252934 in america it is known as the grocery shrink ray and this is one trend from the us that we definitely dont want too much of over here
5252935 we have heard reports of a considerable number of brands downsizing in this way presumably because the grocery industry faces increased costs for energy and ingredients but doesnt want to be seen to raise prices
5252936 companies should realise that once caught out their corporate reputation could suffer and customers always have the power to switch brands a brand need to be trusted by shoppers to survive so any company considering short changing their customers should think again
5252937 the food industry in line with other sectors is facing rising costs across the board from raw ingredients to energy and transport bills
5252938 we seek to keep our confectionery affordable in order to offer our consumers value for money and therefore we have slightly reduced the size on some of the larger sharing packs rather than directly raising prices
5252939 the decision to introduce a new 15 can pack of strongbow was brought about by our need to raise wholesale prices in the face of the widespread and unprecedented increase in business costs and the retailers desire to continue to offer the brand in similar party pack format at the same price point
5252940 had retailers not chosen to go down this route they would have had to pass on a hefty price increase to purchasers of the old 18 can pack and they clearly feel that no price increase on a smaller pack offers better consumer value
5252941 the nappy industry has seen a significant increase in the cost of raw materials over the past few years driven by commodity cost inflation for example pulp prices have increased by 18 since 2005 and crude oil by 25

5252949 quando um amigo desafia o outro para uma briga de cinco minutos a id ia ver quem chora e desiste primeiro
5252950 sangrar e ficar com hematomas comum mas a gente tamb m se machuca no futebol fazer o qu
5252951 na hora eu rachei o bico mas depois senti remorso porque o garoto que apanhou era meu amigo e me olhou com uma cara de decep o
5252952 ningu m quer ser o alvo desse tipo de brincadeira
5252953 quando a viol ncia f sica filmada e reproduzida a dor e o sofrimento do agredido s o aumentados porque s o compartilhados com milh es de pessoas o impacto na vida das v timas tremendo
5252954 n o h uma cultura de den ncia aqui por isso fica dif cil quantificar casos desse tipo
5252955 o tema da viol ncia nas escolas n o est na agenda da educa o no brasil nem na am rica latina ainda n o se percebe a import ncia e o impacto desse tipo de viol ncia pelos meios eletr nicos
5252956 existe uma sociedade mais agressiva h uma banaliza o da viol ncia voc agride o seu amigo tira sangue e continua sendo uma brincadeira question vel
5252957 os alunos agem na internet como na vida real sem perceber que outro meio com uma perman ncia maior
5252958 if we are serious about reducing global greenhouse emissions the nuclear option is one we cannot ignore
5252959 the biggest gains in cutting greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation in the shortest possible time and at the lowest cost and least economic risk will come from nuclear power
5252960 its a black and white answer or should i say black and yellow answer clean coal and yellowcake we must include nuclear in our future base load clean energy mix
5252961 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5252962 signore iddio aiuta questa gente perch oggi luomo che viveva qui e conosco anchio scomparso prematuramente

5252964 let the peace of god rule in your heart to which also you are called in one body and be thankful
5252965 let the word of god dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the lord
5252966 wherefore dont be unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is
5252967 beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby you know the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ is come in the flesh is not of god and this is the spirit of the anti christ whereof you heard that it should come and even now already in the world we are of god he that knows god hears us he that is not of god doesnt hear us hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us because he has given to us his spirit
5252968 but if we are to grasp the full value of the materials we must note that myths are not exactly comparable to dream their figures originate from the same sources the unconscious wells of fantasy and their understood function is to serve as a powerful picture language for the communication of traditional wisdom
5252969 the helpful crone and fairy godmother is a familiar feature of european fairy lore what such a figure represents is the benign protecting power of destiny
5252970 tell me your dreams and ill tell you where you are on your lifes journey
5252971 clad in knee high leather boots spandex shorts and a sports bra xiao yan struck a pose two feet off the ground her head glistening with sweat and her arms straining as she suspended herself from a vertical pole
5252972 people here have never seen a pole dance and for that reason they dont associate it with stripping or women of ill repute
5252973 i knew if i could give people a positive first impression of this as a clean fun social activity people wouldnt just accept it theyd embrace it
5252974 i used to take a normal aerobics class but it was boring and monotonous
5252975 yeah i got two chinese women in my office who wear those short shorts and one of them wears a low cut blouse so when she bends over my desk to show me some document she leaves little to the imagination
5252976 they wear those kinds of clothes because they feel it gives them some kind of power in the company over the men and they want other women to know it
5252977 hah when was the last time you got any from your man
5252978 since when did chinese women in suzhou decide it was ok to take up the dress of the oldest profession in the world and consider it appropriate office attire
5252979 and then i said to myself hang on a minute i shouldnt have been able to understand that
5252980 look at the egg on tiananmen square or the cctv building theyre hideous
5252981 oh you westerners always like the traditional architecture which just isnt economical
5252982 youre right about the economics but my point is that none of the new architecture in the national capital reflects a sense of chinese style a kind of continuity between old and new or a projection of the traditional into the future
5252983 the architecture is amazing the developers were able to keep a strong sense of the suzhou architectural style while at the same time updating it modernizing it its lovely
5252984 the main building on the campus must be 30 stories with a great peaked roof that swoops down and up again like a bold red tiled brush stroke the building clearly reflects the fujian traditional style but updates it beautifully
5252985 haha omg i just got monstered by you and jason
5252986 the seasons freshest most sympathetic movie about making your way in modern day manhattan with a little help from your friends
5252987 whats amazing about arthur dongs hollywood chinese a chronicle of chinese americans in hollywood beginning in the silent era and culminating in todays success stories is how much fun it is loaded with film clips celebrity interviews and without an ax to grind its a film not just for chinese americans but for film lovers in general fours stars
5252988 arthur dong once again proves that he is one of the most intelligent incisive documentarians alive with hollywood chinese his study of the portrayal of this ethnic group in the movies myriad amazingly culled interviews with actors filmmakers and historians add rich texture to this bracingly entertaining fast moving survey
5252989 groundbreaking overt racism collides with the economics of an industry and the perceptions of a culture in hollywood chinese a provocative critical survey of the first century of american cinema and the ways that chinese and chinese americans have been depicted by the industry
5252990 if you want to see a fantastic overview of the struggle of asian americans in film in the us a struggle to be included a struggle for a voice a struggle for some truth be sure to check out hollywood chinese
5252991 we believe that our marketing materials are as clear as possible
5252992 we do however take every complaint seriously and move quickly to rectify any situation
5252993 we have reached agreement regarding gazprom financing and building the new main gas pipelines from the east of the country developing gas fields and boosting the capacity of the turkmen sector of the caspian gas pipeline to 30 billion cubic meters
5252994 both china and russia kept silent on the details of the consensus they reached on energy cooperation in the first round of their negotiation in beijing on the weekend
5252995 it seems that a shift of russias energy export policy is under way russia might turn its eyes from the western countries to the asia pacific region the cooperation in the energy sector is an issue of great significance for sino russian relations the political and geographic closeness of the two countries would put their energy cooperation under a safe umbrella and make it a win win deal china russia ties are at their best times the two sides settled their lingering border disputes held joint military exercises and enjoyed rapidly increasing bilateral trade
5252996 moscow finds the idea of coordination of gas production and pricing policy with other gas exporters to be too tempting to abandon
5252997 this forum of gas exporters will set up the global gas balance it will give answers to the questions concerning when where and how much gas should be produced
5252998 we have not only approved these agreements but have also decided to supervise their implementation
5252999 i look forward to seeing all of you in venezuela
5253000 martha was a really good friend of my late mother and had actually been a bridesmaid at her wedding
5253001 she was a very private but a very interesting person to know
5253002 right up until her last couple of months marthas mental prowess and agility was second to none i think it might have to do with all those crosswords she loved doing
5253003 she led a very simple life and the only outward sign of her wealth was when she treated herself to a yearly holiday
5253004 i was extremely surprised to find out she had left as much as 1 million in her will
5253005 i knew she liked to study the stock market but it looks like she knew more about it than she let on
5253006 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
5253007 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
5253008 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
5253009 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
5253010 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
5253011 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the would rally around it
5253012 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5253013 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
5253014 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
5253015 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
5253016 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
5253017 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
5253018 we can say comfortably that over 1 100 search warrants were executed last year and 580 to date this year and that
5253019 youve got the elderly or those with temporary disabilities or say a mom with a toddler and a newborn in a stroller
5253020 certainly the builders were not joyous about the changes but before the ordinance the subject had never come before them
5253021 lots of them have parents or relatives with disabilities or maybe their own knees arent feeling so good im thinking of starting a new group builders against the grain to help with home access legislation
5253022 i will be glad to cooperate but i need to have my attorney present first
5253023 the delay in the itc investment tax credit renewal has meant that large commercial jobs are being postponed
5253024 because they dont want to give the democratic congress any credit
5253025 many of these commercial projects are in important planning stages right now and the overall industry is at the tipping point that will lead to widespread adoption
5253026 the absence of the itc will kill most if not all of this growing momentum we need only look to the interruption of tax credits for the wind industry for an example of something that we do not want to repeat this would be a real shame
5253027 over the longer term however the united states commercial market is far too important to be ignored
5253028 a consistent itc policy extending over several years that allows industry to grow and flourish is critical to the industry
5253029 the itc has become a very politicized issue however and its possible that approval could extend into 2009
5253030 the jobs lost in the u s would move overseas to more favorable solar markets
5253031 solar power will eventually reach cost parity with other energy sources but that will not occur in the next few years without incentives

5253043 sir just after you went she asked me to take out a quilt from her luggage i took the quilt out and gave it to her
5253044 little did i realise that she was very weak and even couldnt take the quilt therefore i hired a cab and took her to my home where my wife is taking care

5253054 i struggle to play my best golf when theres no pressure
5253055 the next level for me is about accepting im a three time major winner taking the confidence from that and that will help me in tournaments so i dont have to put myself through the mill
5253056 theres no doubt ill always make myself available to help anybody else but in that sense winning a couple of majors may make people seek advice from me during that week
5253057 i was happy with his run it being only his third run there were horses with plenty of experience in the race and he gave me a really good feel
5253058 the ground was very very testing and i think he will be able to build on that performance
5253059 id say i was actually going better than king of rome three furlongs out hes very very genuine but inexperience and the heavy ground a combination of both caught him out
5253060 i was pleased with him and id say hell improve from the outing hes a great pedigree he was weak as a two year old and didnt run but i think hes about 16 hands and three
5253061 hes very big has always worked very well at home and aidan has just been taking his time with him he thinks there will be a bit there later on
5253062 we remain bitterly disappointed at the manner in which sonny bill deserted his team mates and his supporters
5253063 we have however reached the point where we need to get on with business and we have withdrawn the injunction against him playing for any other club
5253064 neither the bulldogs nor sonny bill have anything further to gain by drawing this situation out any further
5253065 for that reason we have accepted a significant compensation payout from sonny bill and a commitment that he not play for any other nrl club until his contract was due to expire at the end of the 2012 season
5253066 as a rule danehills prefer faster ground but his heart is in the right place
5253067 i dont know if it was beginning to tell but there was pressure there on us getting goals
5253068 but we always knew that it would come eventually and were just delighted to get three today
5253069 they were just congratulating each other as we were just delighted to get the win and looking forward to next week
5253070 we always knew we could do it we had been creating chances during pre season but they just didnt go in so we are just delighted that they went in today
5253071 weve just got to look forward take every game as they come and get as many three points as we did today
5253072 they fletcher and nish read each others game really well they link up brilliantly so im sure they will get a few more goals between them throughout the season
5253073 but before i knew it the acid was taken from the van
5253074 how much acid the woman had poured on her im not sure it all happened so quickly
5253075 i could hear all of this screaming and yelling coming from the car park and then people were running everywhere to help this woman
5253076 there was a lot of panic and before i knew it there were two police cars and two ambulances
5253077 the health benefits of making sure we have enough fibre in our diet really cant be ignored any longer its not difficult to incorporate more fibre rich foods into our daily routine whether its through starting the day with a bran cereal or swapping from white to wholemeal bread a high fibre diet can help with everything from your weight to your heart health
5253078 free radicals from tobacco smoke have long been suspected of having extremely harmful effects on the body
5253079 based on our work we now know that free radicals similar to those in cigarettes are also found in airborne fine particles and potentially can cause many of the same life threatening conditions
5253080 this is a staggering but not unbelievable result when one considers all of diseases in the world that cannot currently be attributed to a specific origin
5253081 you basically have to be in certain places to inhale transient gas phase radicals
5253082 youd have to be right next to a road when a car passes for example
5253083 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5253084 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5253085 i pray the government stops this down sliding and take the country out of this crisis

5253108 when we found the contamination it was another sign that the way we currently manufacture heparin is simply unsafe
5253109 unlike the current heparin that is harvested from possibly disease carrying animals in often very poor conditions our fully synthetic heparin will be created in a pharmaceutical manufacturing environment from fermentation to packaging this will give drug manufacturers extreme control over the safety and purity of the product
5253110 ultimately drug companies are going to need to produce tons of this drug to keep up with global demand
5253111 such levels of productions are further down the road we think that in five years it is very possible that this drug could reach human clinical trials
5253112 a neurons excitability whether it will fire hinges on this delicate equilibrium
5253113 finding statistically robust associations linked to two proteins that may be involved in regulating such ion channels and that are also thought to be targets of drugs used to clinically to treat bipolar disorder is astonishing
5253114 faced with little agreement among previous studies searching for the genomic hot spots in bipolar disorder these researchers pooled their data for maximal statistical power and unearthed surprising results
5253115 improved understanding of these abnormalities could lead to new hope for the millions of americans affected by bipolar disorder

5253394 2007 was characterised by the impotence of western governments and the ambivalence or reluctance of emerging powers to tackle some of the worlds worst human rights crises ranging from entrenched conflicts to growing inequalities which are leaving millions of people behind
5253395 2008 presents an unprecedented opportunity for new leaders coming to power and countries emerging on the world stage to set a new direction and reject the myopic policies and practices that in recent years have made the world a more dangerous and divided place
5253396 world leaders are in a state of denial but their failure to act has a high cost as iraq and afghanistan show human rights problems are not isolated tragedies but are like viruses that can infect and spread rapidly endangering all of us
5253397 governments today must show the same degree of vision courage and commitment that led the united nations to adopt the universal declaration of human rights sixty years ago
5253398 there is a growing demand from people for justice freedom and equality
5253399 constant improvement of well being of the entire population and of all individuals on the basis of their active free and meaningful participation in development
5253400 equality of opportunity for all in their access to basic resources education health services food housing employment and fair distribution of income
5253401 emphasizes a collective duty of all states to eliminate barriers such as unfair trade rules and debt burden effectively pointing an accusing finger at the industrial countries for this reason it has been opposed by western states 2004 8 cited in ahsan 2006
5253402 together human rights and development are more effective than either one on its own

5253405 we were basically stuck up the canyon without our rafts
5253406 we had no supplies no food and very little water we lost everything

5253414 if we keep getting protection like that we can do whatever we want weve passed the ball well the last two years and knew we were going to be able to throw the football but weve got to keep working on the running game to help our defense
5253415 our quarterback was touched a little bit more than were used to
5253416 we were a little bit out of sync in the passing game early
5253417 the australian heavy metal band trident winter has just released their debut self titled ep

5253426 the zimbabwean issue is far from resolved and so the continent as a whole has a responsibility to continue to engage with us in finding solutions
5253427 part of it is actually a process of trying to unlock the deadlocks that have emerged in the negotiations
5253428 unless tsvangirai signs on the dotted line the crisis continues not only simply because the billions of foreign aid does not become available but also because he does represent a significant majority of the zimbabwean population
5253429 how the vacuum is handled by the civilian government how much control they can exercise on the radical elements remains to be seen
5253430 we have no comments to make on the resignation of president musharraf of pakistan
5253431 after four good years in which india had high hopes for the peace process in the last four months the opposite has happened
5253432 musharraf was seen by india as decisive and ready to engage compared with the chaos and division of the last few months
5253433 the isi enjoyed greater autonomy since musharrafs wings were clipped
5253434 once he is removed from the scene isi may have even greater autonomy
5253435 whether he is impeached or not is not important from the indian point of view
5253436 but it leaves a big vacuum and we are deeply concerned about this vacuum because it leaves the radical extremist outfits with freedom to do what they like not merely on pak istan afghan border but clearly our side of the border too

5253511 under the intense scrutiny of the olympic games with this kind of injury the pain that the athlete has to go through is not something that you can just overcome mentally and endure

5253517 he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform
5253518 if god said so then he should be able to do so because of this that he did the other time and that which he did and this that he did i am now convinced based on these reasons that what god said he will do he is able to do
5253519 for as the father hath life in himself so hath he given to the son to have life in himself
5253520 even as the father has sent me even so send i you
5253521 this must be the reason why the holy spirit took me through that deep thing today

5253528 ang mga taong bayan ang mga tunay na naghihirap dahil sa pagtanggi ng pamahalaan sa ating panukalang mawala ang vat sa produktong petrolyo tuloy pa rin ang ating panawagan na bigyang kagyat na ginhawa para sa ating mga tao the citizens are the ones who really suffer because of the administrations refusal to scrap the vat on petroleum products we continue calling that our people be given a little relief
5253529 gusto ng gobyerno sila ang kokolekta ng vat sila rin ang gagastos may problema ako diyan alam natin kasi na kapag ang gobyerno ang gumastos may leakage hindi tayo nakakasiguro na yung pag gagastusan ng gobyerno ay siyang parehas na pag gastusan natin kapag ang pera ay nananatili sa bulsa natin the government wants to collect the vat and to spend it too i have a problem with that we know that when the government spends there is leakage we cant be sure that what the government spends on is the same as what we would spend on had the money stayed in our pockets
5253530 mamamatay ang pasyente kung patuloy ang pagbigay ng parehong gamot kahit iba na ang sakit iba ang sitwasyon noon mabigat man ang 12 na vat ito ay sa 30 kada bariles na langis pero ngayon na sobra sa 100 kada bariles kaya sobrang bigat na talaga at hindi na kakayanin ng mga tao the patient will die if you continue giving him the same medicine for a different illness the situation then was different while the 12 percent vat might have been onerous it was imposed when oil was 30 a barrel but now when it is over 100 a barrel it is too much for people to bear
5253531 tinitipid nila kami sa pagbababa nila ng presyo sa totoo lang overpriced ang presyo ng langis kaya hindi kami naniniwala sa pagmamalasakit ng gobyerno they are being miserly about bringing down oil prices the truth is oil is overpriced which is why we do not believe government cares
5253532 malaki ang pananagutan ng gobyerno dito dapat tanggalin na ang value added tax sa oil at ang oil deregulation law the government has a lot to answer for the value added tax on oil and the oil deregulation law should be scrapped
5253533 orders for the release of funds were issued with executive fiat and he had no option but to obey for fear of losing his job

5253536 you have people out there who dont have a clue what theyre doing totally agree here in fact i was one of those people even after i took the harley safety learn to ride course and they probably shouldnt even be on a motorcycle

5253539 to try to prevent people from crashing into each other its not enough to simply mandate protective gear or equipment
5253540 we see bikes go by here that i know just came out of sheds two days ago its great for the bikers but now you have a lot more inexperienced riders out in the mix
5253541 one local policeman said theyre seeing an assortment of bikes that really arent road worthy and with riders who definitely arent road worthy
5253542 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5253543 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5253544 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5253545 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5253546 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5253547 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5253548 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5253549 these are common ailments things theyd normally go to their doctor for
5253550 but this way we can handle them more quickly in about 40 minutes
5253551 it definitely decreases the amount of waiting time in the emergency department
5253552 about 10 to 12 percent of patients will qualify to be seen in fast track many patients though are too sick to be seen there
5253553 if you see 100 people a day and 90 of them are very sick its going to take longer and most wont qualify for fast track
5253554 fast tracks have their place but it isnt going to help the problem much

5253566 the lincoln mkt reinforces our commitment to further expand americas fastest growing luxury brand providing an all new vehicle to the showroom thats been crafted and honed for a new kind of customer
5253567 the mkt will offer the comfort of a luxury sedan the spaciousness and flexibility of a crossover and the performance of a sports sedan courtesy of its ecoboost engine
5253568 at the same time this perfect blend of performance and power is elegantly wrapped in the refined design cues that have become synonymous with modern lincolns
5253569 ecoboost engine technology is another symbol of what luxury means today
5253570 lincolns should drive as beautifully as they look delivering as much refinement on the road as their designs do even while standing perfectly still
5253571 embracing the same spirit as the concept the lincoln mkts design represents harmony in motion balancing sculptured shapes and contours traditionally associated with beautiful cars on a crossover vehicle that offers the luxury of space and efficient powerful performance

5253575 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5253576 that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys
5253577 a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5253578 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5253579 the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5253580 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5253581 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5253582 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5253583 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5253584 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5253585 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5253586 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5253587 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous
5253588 i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5253589 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota
5253590 i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a joe gibbs thing how widespread is it and how long has it been going on
5253591 its disappointing to hear that anybody whether its a manufacturer or a team or an individual on a team would go to any length to do that its bad for the entire garage i think
5253592 we obviously knew that people would watch these videos because miley has a fan base and jon has a fan base but this has really helped both groups grow beyond that
5253593 oh ive got to start getting some action going between these guys
5253594 hey im going to call you guys out to an online dance battle
5253595 sorry guys were already signed up for this miley cyrus thing
5253596 if youre bringing people in im bringing people in hard core
5253597 oh well miley can just buy this or buy that
5253598 hey were doing this thing its guaranteed millions of views on youtube
5253599 we didnt have to do what we did today we were relaxed we had a bit of fun and it was all right

5253651 in the past eight years it is about the eighth time that i have heard from various ministers not just from the current minister that those are one in every 100 or 150 years events it seems that we have had 1 000 years of disaster all wrapped up in the past eight years as such events are not now considered to be exceptional circumstances will the minister give an assurance that emergency planning is being strengthened so that the department is aware of where floods are likely to occur they seem to happen in the same places time and time again will the minister also give an assurance that data on the locations of floods will be collected and that the department will liaise closely with the weather forecasters so that early intervention such as the distribution of sandbags can occur before the flooding even starts

5253665 the governor is entitled to the way he perceives us if fighting for our right means we have to go against the law of a country that is criminal by injustice it has meted on the niger delta people then we are proud to be branded as outlaws the sword and the pen seem to be the only language our government understands
5253666 it is not every comment from anybody that must be commented upon you need to understand people and where they come from before you jump to respond to them

5253668 whether he likes it or not rotimi amaechi rode on the shoulders of governor peter odili to become the current governor of rivers state it does not matter whether he was appointed by the supreme court or not we believe that it was his destiny to become governor of rivers state even if his tenure may some day be cut short by the same supreme court
5253669 where was rotimi amaechi when cultists were being sponsored by his mentor and godfather

5253695 libraries are facing competition from television magazines the internet e books yet they have this archaic and mad idea of charging people money for being slightly late
5253696 its all so negative unprofessional and unbusinesslike like any business libraries need not to alienate their customers
5253697 my personal view is that theyre past their sell by date because they do sustain a very old fashioned image of libraries which is out of sync with todays modern library environment and the image libraries are trying to project tolerant responsive flexible stimulating

5253710 rand consultants emphasized that the vietcong saw themselves as waging a war against imperialists for the independence of vietnam they neither were communist zealots nor were they animated like some asian version of mexican zapatistas by a simple desire for land they were patriots and they were in the war for the long haul these were not roving bandits or just plain bad guys they were men of principle who were willing to die for a cause and unless the conditions that gave rise to their discontent changed the guerrilla campaign would go on until they all died or the central government fell

5253728 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
5253729 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
5253730 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
5253731 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
5253732 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
5253733 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
5253734 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself

5253736 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
5253737 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
5253738 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
5253739 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
5253740 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
5253741 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
5253742 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
5253743 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
5253744 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
5253745 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
5253746 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
5253747 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
5253748 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
5253749 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
5253750 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
5253751 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
5253752 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear

5253757 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
5253758 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
5253759 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
5253760 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
5253761 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
5253762 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money

5253765 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
5253766 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
5253767 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
5253768 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
5253769 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
5253770 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
5253771 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
5253772 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings

5253793 the zimbabwean issue is far from resolved and so the continent as a whole has a responsibility to continue to engage with us in finding solutions
5253794 part of it is actually a process of trying to unlock the deadlocks that have emerged in the negotiations
5253795 unless tsvangirai signs on the dotted line the crisis continues not only simply because the billions in foreign aid does not become available but also because he does represent a significant majority of the zimbabwean population
5253796 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may affect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities

5253835 younger children seem more interested in setting short term goals for their learning in the game compared to older children who are more interested in simply playing and the actions of playing

5253924 although many billions of rands have been pumped into setas over the past seven years at least r4 6 billion was received by 22 of the 23 setas in 2006 07 alone they have yet to show they are capable of producing people with the skills that our economy needs or of fulfilling the promises that have been made to the young south africans who have placed their hopes for the future in these training programmes
5253925 a system whereby the authorities responsible for creating and implementing training programmes have no interest in the outcomes is clearly not working
5253926 the da calls for a clean slate in skills development and a scrapping of the setas approach
5253927 we believe that industry badly needs a training system that is demand driven hence we reiterate the need to implement a system of tax rebates for skills development efforts by employers

5253934 there ought to be a common basis for making decisions about exceptional circumstances and i think anybody who uses the nhs for their care is entitled to expect that

5253980 it is time that i should tell you something which you do not know my prayer has been heard i besought fudo sama that i might be permitted to die in the place of o tsuyu and this great favor has been granted me therefore you must not grieve about my death but i have one request to make i promised fudo sama that i would have a cherry tree planted in the garden of saihoji for a thank offering and a commemoration now i shall not be able myself to plant the tree there so i must beg that you will fulfill that vow for me good bye dear friends and remember that i was happy to die for sake
5253981 here what is the matter with you anybody hurt you
5253982 i saw i saw a woman by the moat and she showed me ah i cannot tell you what she showed me
5253983 when the wish is there the eyes can say as much as the mouth
5253984 to see you sewing there with the light on your face makes me think of a strange thing that happened when i was a lad of eighteen i then saw somebody as beautiful and white as you are now indeed she was very like you
5253985 asleep or awake that was the only time that i saw a being as beautiful as you of course she was not a human being and i was afraid of her very much afraid but she was so white indeed i have never been sure whether it was a dream that i saw or the woman of thesnow
5253986 it was i i i yuki it was and i told you then that i would kill you if you ever said one work about it but for those children asleep there i would kill you this moment and now you had better take very very good care of them for if ever they have reason to complain of you i will treat you as you deserve
5253987 ah how pitiful a young gentleman traveling alone in such weather deign young master to enter
5253988 honored sir the next village is far and the snow is falling thickly the wind is piercing and the road is very bad therefore to proceed further this night would probably be dangerous although this hovel is unworthy of your presence and although we have not any comfort to offer perhaps it were safer to remain to night under this miserable roof we would take good care of your horse
5253989 sir our daughter aoyagi 1 has been brought up here in the mountains almost alone and she knows nothing of gentle service we pray that you will pardon her stupidity and her ignorance
5253990 kind sir we very much hope that you will try to eat and to drink a little though our peasant fare is of the worst as you must have been chilled by that piercing wind
5253991 take the luck that the gods have put in your way
5253992 honored master you are a person of high position and likely to rise to still higher things too great is the favor that you deign to offer us indeed the depth of our gratitude therefor is not to be spoken or measured but this girl of ours being a stupid country girl of vulgar birth with no training or teaching of any sort it would be improper to let her become the wife of a noble samurai even to speak of such a matter is not right but since you find the girl to your liking and have condescended to pardon her peasant manners and to overlook her great rudeness we do gladly present her to you for an humble handmaid deign therefore to act hereafter in her regard according to your august pleasure
5253993 though it may seem thankless to ask for more than i have already received i must again beg you to give me your daughter for wife it would be difficult for me to separate from her now and as she is willing to accompany me if you permit i can take her with me as she is if you will give her to me i shall ever cherish you as parents and in the meantime please to accept this poor acknowledgment of your kindest hospitality
5253994 kind master the gold would be of no use to us and you will probably have need of it during your long cold journey here we buy nothing and we could not spend so much money upon ourselves even if we wished as for the girl we have already bestowed her as a free gift she belongs to you therefore it is not necessary to ask our leave to take her away already she has told us that she hopes to accompany you and to remain your servant for as long as you may be willing to endure her presence we are only too happy to know that you deign to accept her and we pray that you will not trouble yourself on our account in this place we could not provide her with proper clothing much less with a dowry moreover being old we should in any event have to separate from her before long therefore it is very fortunate that you should be willing to take her with you now
5253995 it is we and not you who have reason for gratitude we are sure that you will be kind to our girl and we have no fears for her sake
5253996 because you love each other so much i have taken it upon myself to authorize your marriage in lieu of my kinsman the lord of noto and your wedding shall now be celebrated before me the guests are assembled the gifts are ready
5253997 pardon me for thus rudely crying out but the paid was so sudden my dear husband our union must have been brought about through some karma relation in a former state of existence and that happy relation i think will bring us again together in more than one life to come but for this present existence of ours the relation is now ended we are about to be separated repeat for me i beseech you the nembutsu prayer because i am dying
5253998 honored sir you see before you a kerai vassal of the kokuo of tokoyo 1 my master the king commands me to greet you in his august name and to place myself wholly at your disposal he also bids me inform you that he augustly desires your presence at the palace be therefore pleased immediately to enter this honorable carriage which he has sent for your conveyance
5253999 it is now our honorable duty to inform you as to the reason of your having been summoned hither our master the king augustly desires that you become his son in law and it is his wish and command that you shall wed this very day the august princess his maiden daughter we shall soon conduct you to the presence chamber where his augustness even now is waiting to receive you but it will be necessary that we first invest you with the appropriate garments of ceremony
5254000 you have already been informed as to the reason of your having been summoned to our presence we have decided that you shall become the adopted husband of our only daughter and the wedding ceremony shall now be performed
5254001 these are the words which our august master the king of tokoyo commands that i repeat to you we will now send you back to your own people and country
5254002 indeed you saw strange things we also saw something strange while you were napping a little yellow butterfly was fluttering over your face for a moment or two and we watched it then it alighted on the ground beside you close to the tree and almost as soon as it alighted there a big big ant came out of a hole and seized it and pulling it down into the hole just before you woke up we saw that very butterfly come out of the hole again and flutter over your face as before and then it suddenly disappeared we do not know where it went
5254003 ants are queer beings possibly goblins anyhow there is a big ants nest under that cedar tree
5254004 and there is the palace of tokoyo how extraordinary raishu ought to lie somewhere southwest of it to the left of that big root yes here it is how very strange now i am sure that i can find the mountain of hanryoko and the grave of the princess
5254005 i am stopping near this temple and have been sent to you with a message my present lord a person of exceedingly high rank is now staying in akamagaseki with many noble attendants he wished to view the scene of the battle of dan no ura and to day he visited that place having heard of your skill in reciting the story of the battle he now desires to hear your performance so you will take your biwa and come with me at once to the house where the august assembly is waiting
5254006 it is now required that the history of the heike be recited to the accompaniment of the biwa
5254007 as the whole of the story is not soon told what portion is it augustly desired that i now recite
5254008 recite the story of the battle at dan no ura for the pity of it is the most deep
5254009 never in our own province was playing heard like this
5254010 not in all the empire is there another singer like hoichi
5254011 although we had been assured that you were a very skillful player upon the biwa and without an equal in recitative we did not know that any one could be so skillful as you have proved yourself to night our lord has been pleased to say that he intends to bestow upon you a fitting reward but he desires that you shall perform before him once every night for the next six nights after which time he will probably make his august return journey to morrow night therefore you are to come here at the same hour the retainer who to night conducted you will be sent for you there is another matter about which i have been ordered to inform you it is required that you shall speak to no one of your visits here during the time of our lords august sojourn at akamagaseki as he is traveling incognito 6 he commands that no mention of these things be made you are now free to go back to your temple
5254012 we have been very anxious about you friend hoichi to go out blind and alone at so late an hour is dangerous why did you go without telling us i could have ordered a servant to accompany you and where have you been
5254013 pardon me kind friend i had to attend to some private business and i could not arrange the matter at any other hour
5254014 hoichi san hoichi san come home with us at once
5254015 to interrupt me in such a manner before this august assembly will not be tolerated
5254016 hoichi my poor friend you are now in great danger how unfortunate that you did not tell me all this before your wonderful skill in music has indeed brought you into strange trouble by this time you must be aware that you have not been visiting any house whatever but have been passing your nights in the cemetery among the tombs of the heike and it was before the memorial tomb of antoku tenno that our people to night found you sitting in the rain all that you have been imagining was illusion except the calling of the dead by once obeying them you have put yourself in their power if you obey them again after what has already occurred they will tear you in pieces but they would have destroyed you sooner or later in any event now i shall not be able to remain with you to night i am called away to perform another service but before i go it will be necessary to protect your body by writing holy texts upon it
5254017 to night as soon as i go away you must seat yourself on the verandah and wait you will be called but whatever may happen do not answer and do not move say nothing and sit still as if meditating if you stir or make any noise you will be torn asunder do not get frightened and do not think of calling for help because no help could save you if you do exactly as i tell you the danger will pass and you will have nothing more to fear
5254018 no answer that wont do must see where the fellow is
5254019 here is the biwa but of the biwa player i see only two ears so that explains why he did not answer he had no mouth to answer with there is nothing left of him but his ears now to my lord those ears i will take in proof that the august commands have been obeyed so far as was possible
5254020 all my fault my very grievous fault everywhere upon your body the holy texts had been written except upon your ears i trusted my acolyte to do that part of the work and it was very very wrong of me not to have made sure that he had done it well the matter cannot now be helped we can only try to heal your hurts as soon as possible cheer up friend the danger is now well over you will never again be troubled by those visitors
5254021 theyll go through a vacant business thinking they are going to bypass an alarm and break through the sheetrock
5254022 no the feeling is that is this is going to be a good year for real madrid
5254023 we said that the project was complete and i am sure that this season is going to be one of consolidation
5254024 i would love to win everything real madrid have to aspire to win everything from the start and what happens after that depends on many factors
5254025 he has looked very happy in the hotel he is going to play this season with us i am absolutely sure
5254026 he has looked lively very happy and full of desire and the coach bernd schuster has told me that he is training very well
5254027 he is a player whose club did not want to sell him there are a lot of clubs who want our players and we dont want to sell them either this is football it was a matter between the player and his club
5254028 we were a little higher in oil prices earlier and oil now seems to have come off a little bit which helps the tone
5254029 the other positive is that the geopolitical concerns we had last week are beginning to wane

5254039 a few issues happened between me and the club so i no longer play for them
5254040 my personal trainer works with brescia and i did a lot of work with him there during the off season so maybe that is where the rumours are from
5254041 but there a few offers i am studying even though i am not in a hurry i want to make the right choice at the end of it all the most important thing is that wherever i end up i will give it my absolute all
5254042 i am happy just to be alive after the injury i was complaining of asthma after surgery last year but it was not that i missed an injection and blood went into my lungs football was not the most important thing i nearly lost my life
5254043 sometimes when things happen you can be knocked off if you are not strong mentally but i am strong mentally and i never give up which is why i am still going strong
5254044 i dont want to rush the comeback i want everything to be gradual i have been out for one year and i understand it will take time to get my rhythm back everything is going well and very soon you will see me again on the football field
5254045 there is no technological reason why you cant play cross platform but there is a philosophical reason why design doesnt want to do it if we have to compromise one platform to support both then we wont a couple of members of our team gained a lot of experience working on shadowrun and no matter how well you fine tune it you end up with a player base thats polarized
5254046 ive always been a fan of racing games and working on need for speed undercover was an amazing experience i was so impressed by the scope and quality of the overall production that goes into a videogame these days it was like any other day on a hollywood set i felt right at home the black box team is doing tremendous work here and i cant wait to see the final game
5254047 need for speed undercover features a deep and engaging story of spectacular hollywood style live action that will transport players into the fictional world of the tri city bay area working with talent the calibre of maggie q allows us to deliver an unparalleled level of storytelling that will keep players engaged in between 180 mile an hour races

5254059 didnt need to get briefed on south ossetia and georgia to make his statement about what ought to be done there
5254060 he knew immediately what ought to be done because hes been there time and again hes been to the region time and again hes been to south ossetia he knows the characters involved and so he was able to move immediately and with strength and with a definition of the issue that others had to follow
5254061 teddy roosevelt said talk softly and carry a big stick
5254062 in much of the world now were talking loudly and have no stick because what weve done is weve so focused on iraq that weve let victory escape from our grasp in afghanistan and in regions of the world like russia weve let the dangers grow more intense

5254078 asphalt has a lot of advantages as a solar collector for one blacktop stays hot and could continue to generate energy after the sun goes down unlike traditional solar electric cells in addition there is already a massive acreage of installed roads and parking lots that could be retrofitted for energy generation so there is no need to find additional land for solar farms roads and lots are typically resurfaced every 10 to 12 years and the retrofit could be built into that cycle extracting heat from asphalt could cool it reducing the urban heat island effect finally unlike roof top solar arrays which some find unattractive the solar collectors in roads and parking lots would be invisible

5254119 many patents work in the same way that subprime mortgages and all its derivatives they create false assets and so false economies that finally develop in important economical crisis but in the case of patents it is worse indeed because every patent is potentially a monopoly and a block to the free market

5254138 also most corporations have spent the last 10 years focusing on tighter controls around the perimeter of networks
5254139 its getting harder to break into firms from the outside in traditional hacking attacks so the bad guys are focusing on how to use insiders to get to the data
5254140 unless you have a need to know you should not be looking at sensitive data
5254141 for instance one policy could be that admins in the it department cannot share credentials with other admins so that theres accountability
5254142 you have to train employees as to whats acceptable and unacceptable and what kinds of things are just considered bad practice such as leaving spreadsheets on an unattended file server
5254143 many companies have policies but they dont have a way to enforce them
5254144 you have to make sure that if youre creating audit reports and generating real time alerts that theres an established process to review these exceptions and address them
5254145 we developed a series of roundtable meetings and did a lot of research into what happened at socgen and where it fell down and used it as a benchmark to assess our strengths and weaknesses in mitigating risk
5254146 i keyed in on things like identity and access control making sure only the right people have access to the right things
5254147 we strive to have internal controls were small we have 250 people so the key for us is to keep it simple and not get bogged down in red tape
5254148 from an operational perspective when you talk about socgen or the risks to business from an insider its about the lack of controls around specific individuals
5254149 constitutes half of all data breaches because of poor enforcement of access management policy throughout organizations and new vulnerabilities in the enterprise
5254150 large companies have thousands of applications to solve a problem that were built 10 years ago with different needs in mind
5254151 they often dont know who has access to what if someone leaves they dont know what access theyve had
5254152 one of the biggest challenges is in the ugly stuff the integration between systems
5254153 so not only are the applications more complex as individual technologies but also the systems environments are more heterogeneous which results in additional complexities
5254154 there is no doubt now in my mind whatsoever that that is the reason why those responsible have never been brought to justice that agents were involved now that ten years have passed there are those in the establishment who are hoping that we will go away but if they think that they are very much mistaken
5254155 there has been a cover up and we will fight to unravel that cover up

5254174 as conditions in some of our markets deteriorated during the first half of 2008 our growth rates have slowed

5254178 everybody has experienced the effect of hair conditioners which make hair smooth pleasant to touch and easy to comb

5254212 liu xiang gave us hope of excelling in this area
5254213 we really didnt want to give him so much pressure
5254214 but liu xiang winning the gold in these games would have been the icing on the cake for chinese people
5254215 i never thought he would drop out in the preliminaries
5254216 i know that liu xiang made this decision today after braving his injuries and overcoming all the pressure put on him in past competitions
5254217 pilot mark believes the myth that the plane will be held in place by the belt
5254218 additionally the obvious intention of the myth is to give a clear difference in the possible outcomes either it flies or it is held stationary and measuring the speed relative to the ground will never give this clear difference even a car will achieve a speed relative to the ground of half the speed shown on its speedometer so much so that if a plane was fitted with wings which caused it to take off at 50mph it could achieve a speed of 100mph on the speedometer and it would take off
5254219 if you put a plane on a treadmill will it be able to take off

5254222 there ought to be a common basis for making decisions about exceptional circumstances and i think anybody who uses the nhs for their care is entitled to expect that
5254223 what patients need to do is to find out from those who are making the decision what the basis of that decision is and if they dont think its reasonable if they dont think it compares appropriately with decisions that are taken elsewhere ask why not

5254230 if you want to do business in china jack perkowski is your man in managing the dragon he takes you into the heart of the middle kingdom and shows you the way with insight humor and the kind of practical advice an entrepreneur or a down home tourist needs to navigate this fascinating and often bewildering colossus of a country
5254231 ive just finished managing the dragon which i thought was fantastic i was riveted by it i cannot believe what jack perkowski has accomplished and what an adventure hes had how he lived through it how he has succeeded and how well written his book is it reads somewhere between a novel a how to book and primer on a second business life in a developing country
5254232 i love jack perkowskis book it tells with some bravado and lots of humility the first hand story of a man who dared himself to move to china to seize upon the greatest economic boom of our age perkowski invites us into his world into the blur of business meetings and friendships hirings firings and onto chinas shop floors he reveals what it took to build a world class manufacturing company in a country that like perkowski himself needed to set firm goals but reach them in an environment where the rules and circles of influence shift daily managing the dragon is more than a manual more than a memoir it is a gift from a seasoned friend offering the keys to his wisdom and experience
5254233 managing the dragon is more than a great story about jack perkowski and his courage to move to the new frontier it is a graduate degree in the trials tribulations and successes of starting from scratch in china jack captures the essence of doing business in china and turns it into a very compelling how to guide my experiences in china over the last 14 years validate the accuracy of jack perceptions managing the dragon is superb and will be a must read for any borgwarner executive involved with china
5254234 business books on china are published so frequently these days it seems there is a secret factory churning them out

5254241 we developed a series of roundtable meetings and did a lot of research into what happened at socgen and where it fell down and used it as a benchmark to assess our strengths and weaknesses in mitigating risk
5254242 i keyed in on things like identity and access control making sure only the right people have access to the right things
5254243 we strive to have internal controls were small we have 250 people so the key for us is to keep it simple and not get bogged down in red tape
5254244 from an operational perspective when you talk about socgen or the risks to business from an insider its about the lack of controls around specific individuals
5254245 constitutes half of all data breaches because of poor enforcement of access management policy throughout organizations and new vulnerabilities in the enterprise
5254246 large companies have thousands of applications to solve a problem that were built 10 years ago with different needs in mind
5254247 they often dont know who has access to what if someone leaves they dont know what access theyve had
5254248 one of the biggest challenges is in the ugly stuff the integration between systems
5254249 so not only are the applications more complex as individual technologies but also the systems environments are more heterogeneous which results in additional complexities

5254261 using yellowfins presentation layer as the front end of sybase iq provides organisations with an all encompassing business intelligence solution to very quickly find and analyse valuable corporate information in todays rapidly changing business environments information and performance management is an important competitive differentiator
5254262 we have specifically focused on tailoring the yellowfin solution for sybase iq to link an extremely fast analytics server to a bi solution that makes mass data deployment easy and cost effective sybase retains the relationship with its corporate client base who now benefit from a more user friendly front end interface whilst yellowfin gains a much larger potential revenue pipeline with such a significant partner this deal also confirms our belief that yellowfin is worldclass product with enormous global potential

5254270 we are not limited by words google can only find an image if a particular search word is in proximity to it we have the ability on a large scale to tell somebody where one of their images has appeared and how its being used
5254271 its being used by researchers who need to find where an image came from to provide attribution even people who are trying to find out who people are in old photos
5254272 we had somebody who had a photograph of a soldier whod arrived on the beach at normandy and they couldnt find their name they did a whole bunch of searches on tineye and found a tiny little photo on an american website that listed everybody whod gone to normandy with a photograph thats exactly when tineye is useful when you have an image but no words

5254277 the responsibilities on political leaders in pakistan are now significant
5254278 they need to come together to ensure that the recently elected government carries forward an economic and security agenda consistent with the long term interests of the pakistani people
5254279 the uk will remain strongly committed to its partnership with the pakistani people notably through our aid programme
5254280 i look forward to the early election of a new president in pakistan to take forward the important shared work that binds our two countries together

5254282 es w re aber v llig abwegig von einer rezession zu sprechen
5254283 sicherlich gewinnt die selbstdarstellung im internet besonders bei den heranwachsenden bis mitte zwanzig stetig an bedeutung
5254284 doch gerade dieser altersgruppe ist nicht wirklich bewusst dass sie vermehrt unvorsichtig mit ihren pers nlichen daten umgeht
5254285 die nutzer sind unvorsichtig und fragen sich nicht unbedingt wie sie sich pr sentieren oder wem sie ihre passw rter verraten das bewusstsein dass mein profil und meine fotos oder statements von tausenden von menschen gesehen werden und ich nicht berblicken kann wer es sieht muss sich erst entwickeln
5254286 ein gro teil besch ftigt sich aber erst gar nicht mit den datenschutzbestimmungen
5254287 oder sie nennen ihre passw rter ihren freunden und surfen unbedacht im internet umher
5254288 mit solchen programmen k nnen web 2 0 nutzer sich sicherer im internet bewegen
5254289 ich kann jedem nur raten zu berlegen welche statements und fotos er im web 2 0 bereitstellt
5254290 nur weil ich mit jemandem seit monaten in einem social network in kontakt stehe sollte ich ihm nicht sofort mein uneingeschr nktes vertrauen schenken oftmals kenne ich die person letztlich doch noch nicht mal pers nlich

5254292 it is very worrying that general practitioners and other health care professionals are often missing the signs and symptoms of hiv infection
5254293 this can mean they become seriously ill in the longer term and respond less well to treatment it also means they are likely to be putting partners at risk of infection as they may live undiagnosed for a number of years
5254294 while the social networking trend first took off in north america it is beginning to reach a point of maturity in the region
5254295 however the phenomenon is still growing rapidly in other regions around the world especially as the established american brands turn their focus to developing markets
5254296 facebook has done an exceptional job of leveraging its brand internationally during the past year
5254297 by increasing the sites relevance to local markets through local language interface translation the site is now competing strongly or even capturing the lead in several markets where it had a relatively minor presence just a year ago

5254310 es injustificada aunque sea por las obras del metro ya que hay medios suficientes para poder hacer esas obras sin talar los rboles
5254311 talar unos rboles de mas de cien a os es acabar con un monumento de la naturaleza y se obra demasiado a la ligera en este sentido
5254312 es habitual pagar a mintra para que cuide con tal mimo unos rboles que en la actualidad est n cad veres desde la fecha en que se plantaron y que no se tome la molestia de regarlos o reponerlos

5254320 it is disappointing to see howard dean trying to use gender and race to divide voters his comments are insulting inappropriate and have no place in this election
5254321 howard deans comments on race and gender today are disappointing and wrong his efforts to divide americans are an insult to all our nations citizens and have absolutely no place in the national dialogue

5254328 the portion of the adam walsh law that has not been passed in tennessee is the juvenile portion
5254329 hes a poster child for the need for this legislation
5254330 because he was a juvenile when the offense occurred he is not required to register
5254331 before you come up with a memorial you really have to think about some of the values
5254332 we decided we needed to have a memorial thats appropriate uplifting serene accessible permanent and enduring
5254333 were trying not to tell the artist what medium to use we dont want to hinder the artists creativity
5254334 the families i know that theyre happy with the pace
5254335 a year ago at this point we thought we were behind and they said they needed a year to get through what they had to get through and then this past year there were issues of litigation and things they were dealing with they asked us to wait until january to have our first meeting this year
5254336 get as much participation and buy in as possible from the families rescue personnel and community as well
5254337 i think its a great idea for all of us to help him
5254338 i will say without his help and without his acknowledging that i could not have gotten the labor support during the primary
5254339 as many of you know hes very popular with labor across the state and without that i could not have gotten their support
5254340 i learned a lot of lessons in my first race in 2003 i had never been in politics
5254341 it turned out to be an experience at the time that wasnt pleasant for me but also i didnt handle it well
5254342 he wants to get through the convention before we actually do
5254343 i am more fired up right now even though im not even running for this office because this guy mcconnell reminds me every time i turn on the tv why i was mad
5254344 its got to be done with excitement and its got to be done with passion
5254345 this is just not something where we can go through the motions
5254346 that just seemed like a lasting living memorial and people could take the iris anywhere wherever they were from
5254347 i know when im digging irises i will be thinking of pat
5254348 i am hoping that these irises that have been growing next to the pasture of where the plane went down would be accepted as a token of lexington and our thoughts and prayers are with those people who perished that day
5254349 i just think its a nice living piece that could be passed on
5254350 i didnt know it was going to get this big
5254351 means more to me than the other one being developed in lexington just because he didnt have to do it
5254352 its not something expected of him hes done it solely out of the kindness of his heart
5254353 i felt that the community needed it because we lost a lot of victims to that tragedy so it was pretty much mandatory that there had to be a memorial for them
5254354 i thought that a water feature would be the best thing to kind of bring serenity to the memorial
5254355 full cooperation with this investigation from the beginning has been an important part of this process
5254356 that was 15 years ago he said he didnt want to get into that
5254357 but if we are to grasp the full value of the materials we must note that myths are not exactly comparable to dream their figures originate from the same sources the unconscious wells of fantasy and their understood function is to serve as a powerful picture language for the communication of traditional wisdom
5254358 the helpful crone and fairy godmother is a familiar feature of european fairy lore what such a figure represents is the benign protecting power of destiny
5254359 tell me your dreams and ill tell you where you are on your lifes journey
5254360 look at the egg on tiananmen square or the cctv building theyre hideous
5254361 oh you westerners always like the traditional architecture which just isnt economical
5254362 youre right about the economics but my point is that none of the new architecture in the national capital reflects a sense of chinese style a kind of continuity between old and new or a projection of the traditional into the future
5254363 the architecture is amazing the developers were able to keep a strong sense of the suzhou architectural style while at the same time updating it modernizing it its lovely
5254364 the main building on the campus must be 30 stories with a great peaked roof that swoops down and up again like a bold red tiled brush stroke the building clearly reflects the fujian traditional style but updates it beautifully
5254365 clad in knee high leather boots spandex shorts and a sports bra xiao yan struck a pose two feet off the ground her head glistening with sweat and her arms straining as she suspended herself from a vertical pole
5254366 people here have never seen a pole dance and for that reason they dont associate it with stripping or women of ill repute
5254367 i knew if i could give people a positive first impression of this as a clean fun social activity people wouldnt just accept it theyd embrace it
5254368 i used to take a normal aerobics class but it was boring and monotonous
5254369 everyone here knows though that these tuition hikes 9 percent at the university of kentucky and double digits at some of our other universities that is a tax
5254370 i think you have to live within your means right now the budget is about priorities
5254371 sen williams has guaranteed i will be on the appropriations committee so i will be among those setting priorities
5254372 with rep stein if she were elected she wont even be in the room when those decisions are made
5254373 the budget that we passed is very irresponsible because our value statement says that we do not care about the common good of the common people and we do not care much about education
5254374 models who are interested in trying out are ask to be between the heights of five feet eight inches to six feet tall while the males should be between five feet eight inches to six feet two inches
5254375 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5254376 throughout his long career congressman allen has supported fairness and equality while opposing discrimination
5254377 his voting record on lgbt issues is exceptional he has worked to eliminate discrimination in jobs housing public accommodations and financial matters and we look forward to working with him to win fully inclusive federal employment non discrimination legislation
5254378 congressman allen has proven his commitment to lgbt issues and this commitment is not a matter of political convenience
5254379 he has always taken the time to attend lgbt community events and rallies in maine even in non election years and he has reached out to lgbt constituents to hear our communitys concerns
5254380 after repeated requests for her to sponsor legislation senator collins has called for a re examination of this policy but that is simply not enough
5254381 until it is repealed dont ask dont tell will undermine national security and perpetuate discrimination against lgbt americans who serve their country
5254382 since its enactment in 1993 this discredited and unjust law has resulted in the discharge of more than 12 000 gay and lesbian service members from the military
5254383 if elected to the u s senate i will co sponsor and continue to work for passage of legislation to repeal the dont ask dont tell law eliminate discrimination in the armed forces and honor the contributions and sacrifices of lgbt americans who serve our country with skill dedication and courage
5254384 congressman allen has refused to vote in lockstep with the most anti lgbt administration in modern history his votes have broken with this administration over 80 percent of the time meanwhile senator collins chose to vote with this anti lgbt administration 77 percent of the time she has also supported the confirmation of highly conservative court appointees setting back progress on relationship recognition issues and endangering critical protections for our allies for women and for choice
5254385 i am looking forward to congressman allens success in his campaign and i know he will be a valuable asset to maine and to the nation as a member of the united states senate
5254386 i think its open to interpretation and thats the great thing
5254387 you know if i want to protest something because it offends me thats my right as an american and its also any artists right to say and do whatever they wanna do
5254388 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
5254389 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people
5254390 would you like to work tonight from 5 00 til 9 30
5254391 moscow may be expected to punish israel for its intervention

5254398 do icc colour management close the window and re open it the box is still unchecked so far so good
5254399 yeah i got two chinese women in my office who wear those short shorts and one of them wears a low cut blouse so when she bends over my desk to show me some document she leaves little to the imagination
5254400 they wear those kinds of clothes because they feel it gives them some kind of power in the company over the men and they want other women to know it
5254401 hah when was the last time you got any from your man
5254402 since when did chinese women in suzhou decide it was ok to take up the dress of the oldest profession in the world and consider it appropriate office attire
5254403 and then i said to myself hang on a minute i shouldnt have been able to understand that
5254404 this is what it is to be a human being to have a feeling of belonging to something now she has to leave that feeling
5254405 haha omg i just got monstered by you and jason

5254408 but this year im forcing the kids to reuse their backpacks
5254409 they each cost 50 they like the special cool ones and theyre still holding up
5254410 ive got two teenage boys and they like the brand names
5254411 they shant expect that this year were a cheap bunch here at this house anyway
5254412 i think if parents are going to drive their kids to school and not use bus service thats already available that creates problems
5254413 those choices have to be revisited just like everywhere else

5254421 i started by creating an inventory of fabric wall hangings under the name of fall to earth designs and i thought that the internet was the way to go because the quality and price of my work was upscale enough that it didnt fit in with most craft venues
5254422 i started with about 50 pieces and have sold a number of them but i knew that i needed another product to complement my own work my son recommended tapestry products which fits with my need for artistic expression and allows me to actually build the business rather than spending all of my time making products
5254423 i had no idea beforehand that tapestries were so affordable or even that they were available to the general public
5254424 my supplier offers a new product called pictureweave that im really fond of some of us in the industry call it photoweave that allows you to have your favorite photograph woven into an heirloom quality photo wall tapestry blanket pillow or tote bag in fact my son and i picked out a photograph to have reproduced into a tote bag and that picture has basically turned into my calling card and the logo for tapestry biz
5254425 my overall goal for the blog is to help educate consumers about tapestry products and especially the photo reproduction tapestries throws pillows and tote bags
5254426 i also want to discuss new artists and styles my friend sid campbell is a local artist and were working to get his images on my woven tapestry products and into local stores his specialty is japanese warrior art and hawaiian warrior art and ill be discussing him and other artists on my blog to help bring attention to them and their wonderful work

5254430 the government just at this moment when we are in the run up to the games is actually cutting the budget for the organisation that promotes britain abroad thats visit britain by 20
5254431 the government has made a lot about the benefits which will flow from the olympics not just to east london but right across the country and one of the principal benefits should be to benefit tourism with people seeing around the world what britain has to offer
5254432 all too often you see tourism bodies of governments wake up too late and we miss the opportunity
5254433 by securing the 2012 games for britain we have provided a once in a lifetime opportunity for our tourism industry
5254434 it is now up to the industry to make the most of the games and there has been no change in the governments high level of commitment to helping it do that
5254435 but public finances are tight and we have to make every pound of our investment go further
5254436 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5254437 the local minority leaders and other residents seem to believe such a measure may be targeting a particular race of people

5254445 if all our customers have the same terms as nokia qualcomm would be very happy
5254446 the judge in the nokia dispute set an artificial deadline and would not allow the start of the trial to move back any further maybe the same will happen to trigger a settlement in the broadcom suit
5254447 we are not quite so worried about that action since we have workarounds for the broadcom patents which are already in chips and that give us negotiating leverage we have worked through multiple decision trees on the outcomes of that legal action and although wed like to see it resolved whichever way its goes it will not have as great an effect as the nokia action

5254468 get a fair crack of the whip and that only the skilled migrants we actually need will be able to come
5254469 points for skilled workers such as teachers nurses and engineers will be awarded according to qualifications and salary prospects
5254470 to qualify skilled foreign nationals will have to earn a certain number of points before being allowed to work in britain these points are awarded only if a person can prove they will be doing skilled work speak a good standard of english and are earning more than 24 000 or have a decent qualification employers will need a licence from the uk border agency to offer jobs to skilled workers
5254471 why not grant work permit holders with four years continuous work in the uk indefinite leave to remain after all these migrants would have already qualified for ilr had the rules not been changed and applied retrospectively
5254472 germany is a special rally for me and as we wont get the chance to come here next year it was good to finish like this
5254473 we had a good feeling in the car all weekend and had no real problems to contend with everything worked out well and now i am in the best position to start the rest of the season maybe new zealand will be a little more difficult now i will be first on the road because there is a lot of loose gravel especially if its dry but at the moment im happy to take the lead of the championship
5254474 fourth for me is not so bad on asphalt weve done some good stage times and set some good splits so if we can increase the consistency its not looking so bad for the asphalt rallies later in season

5254476 the introduction of our australian style points system will ensure that only those with skills the country needs can come
5254477 migrants benefit this country economically contributing an estimated 6bn to our national output as well as socially and culturally and it is right that we have a system which is fair but firm accessible but controlled
5254478 todays proposals are part of the biggest changes to british immigration policy in a generation which include a new deal for those migrants seeking citizenship here a new uk border agency to strengthen controls at the border and the introduction of id cards for foreign nationals
5254479 today sees the start of our points system and the beginning of on the spot fines for businesses who employ illegal workers introduced a day ahead of schedule
5254480 new 10 000 penalties mean instant justice for those firms who try and undercut others by employing illegal immigrants
5254481 the key to shutting down illegal immigration is to shut down illegal jobs last year we stepped up our illegal working operations by 40 per cent now our enforcement teams have a host of new powers to shut down dodgy bosses who draw illegal immigrants to britain

5254488 i was doing the same lap time over and over and i was quite happy with the pace the crash came out of the blue that corner was an easy one but i lost the front and it happened very quickly very suddenly and i didnt manage to save it we knew that we needed to win this race and more to close down valentinos advantage so this makes the championship very difficult for us
5254489 i knew today would be very difficult with casey so strong and his first lap was impressive
5254490 i lost a bit of time with john hopkins in the first corner because he overtook me this time we had the pace with stoner and i was catching up with him i knew my setting and tyres were working well i think i could possibly have beaten him in a battle unfortunately he crashed and then i was ahead with an 11 second lead if he hadnt crashed then things would have been tougher

5254529 as sadc we encourage and appeal to the parties to sign any outstanding agreements and conclude the negotiations as a matter of urgency in order to restore political stability in zimbabwe
5254530 the decision will certainly have to come from zimbabwean people the parties know what is best for them
5254531 i am quite sure that zimbabwe leaders will do what they think is required for that country
5254532 it is critically important that any solution taken should be a product owned by the entire population of zimbabwe
5254533 this is critically important because any solution that is imposed from outside will not last unless it is a common product that is owned by this entire collective of the leadership of zimbabwe
5254534 the mdc welcomes the fact that the talks will continue as it quite evident from the sadc chairperson that the dialogue will continue under the framework of the memorandum of understanding that was signed on 25 july 2008 by the principals

5254616 after liu xiangs injury i wont bother coming back to the for more
5254617 and will encourage him to come back to the track
5254618 i think they will be disappointed but they will understand
5254619 but weve worked to make it something that does not punish the legit owners
5254620 i didnt have a specialist at that time and so i was a bit in limbo
5254621 i think she took pity and sort of did it
5254622 its probably easier to get drugs off fat charlie round the back of the bus station than it is to get medicines but there we are
5254623 the extent of the benefits and the numbers of patients involved
5254624 as they inevitably will move into the moderate stage of the disease
5254625 i feel particularly angry on behalf of early onset patients because it feels like an insult and the younger you are the more insulting it is
5254626 a lot of people with early onset have got dependents both younger and older and theyre trying to hold down a job
5254627 it is a really nasty disease and i cannot imagine cancer patients being denied a drug like this in similar circumstances
5254628 if im not on the drug id find certain things difficult doing up buttons so you get a line of buttons in the shirt done up right can be a problem
5254629 in theory i should be that much worse but my wife has said that im better now than i was in the autumn
5254630 alzheimers scares people and at four oclock in the morning it scares me and aricept is well worth having for the relief that it brings

5254632 too many of the symptoms of a government at the end of its tether
5254633 we already display too many of the symptoms of a government at the end of its tether the bickering the declining enthusiasm the shuffling positioning and repositioning of leadership contenders along with escapist dreams about a period in opposition in order to get our heads straight
5254634 if all this builds up into a death wish it wont just be fatal for
5254635 this is why gordon brown the prudent presbyterian on his miserable british holiday in his respectable suit is also in the last chance saloon unless he takes decisions far tougher than those he has congratulated himself on for so long and opts for economic sense rather than further deference to finance and business then its morituri te salutamus we who are about to die salute you
5254636 our key problems are declining demand and unprofitable production so we should tackle both by encouraging demand splashing out money in tax rebates fuel allowances pensions and benefits as well as reducing interest rates substantially
5254637 the twin bogeymen of gaping deficits and galloping inflation are likely to frighten the electorate rather less than they frighten the bank of england even if either were to develop which is unlikely they could be dealt with after our successful re election
5254638 he gave me a little tap on the way in to get past which was a bit of a forceful move and i was pushed out into the gravel
5254639 unfortunately rejoining the circuit we had a bit of contact im sorry that it happened there was no malice or anything like that involved you dont do that kind of thing fighting for tenth position
5254640 i had a really good start off the line and immediately focus on passing jason that wasnt possible in the end but i scored a significant amount of points which is important
5254641 it was a difficult race and the result is clearly not where we want to be
5254642 i dont want to be fighting at the back of the top 15 and neither does my team or yamaha and it is disappointing all i can do is go out there with whatever i have got underneath me and give it my maximum and i did that
5254643 but this team and yamaha deserve to be higher up and today wasnt good enough
5254644 it is disappointing because i have slipped out of the top ten in the standings and that was one of my big goals before the start of the season
5254645 iran is not suffering from sanctions if it can still bring things through dubai
5254646 ban or restrict imports exports or passthrough shipments for reasons of health safety environmental concerns national security or foreign affairs
5254647 neither of them wants to be too close to the u s nor too distant from iran
5254648 hey why dont you come in here and read me a story
5254649 also most corporations have spent the last 10 years focusing on tighter controls around the perimeter of networks
5254650 its getting harder to break into firms from the outside in traditional hacking attacks so the bad guys are focusing on how to use insiders to get to the data
5254651 unless you have a need to know you should not be looking at sensitive data
5254652 for instance one policy could be that admins in the it department cannot share credentials with other admins so that theres accountability
5254653 you have to train employees as to whats acceptable and unacceptable and what kinds of things are just considered bad practice such as leaving spreadsheets on an unattended file server
5254654 many companies have policies but they dont have a way to enforce them
5254655 you have to make sure that if youre creating audit reports and generating real time alerts that theres an established process to review these exceptions and address them

5254727 leroy gave voice to a topic that we are very uncomfortable with death and dying
5254728 my cancer had a face and a heart and a smile
5254729 he looked to be about 5 which meant he was probably 10 malnutrition will do that
5254730 he was lying on his back and had thrown his arm up over his head his fingers had gotten tangled in my boot laces as i looked in his eyes i saw the light go out and he died a strangers face my face was the last thing he saw and all i could do was shake my foot to free my laces from his fingers and then move on to catch up to my team it was five years before i could tell that story
5254731 while his craft was to illustrate television stories with the right picture his gift was using words to touch people
5254732 would eloquently tell the subscribers to the daily nightline e mail why the broadcast on that particular night mattered
5254733 a daily reminder that none of us walks this road alone what could be better than that
5254734 its not just that he gives people an opportunity to open up and they do so many of them do on his blog but that he is the voice for people
5254735 that sometimes they feel they dont need to speak that hes speaking the words that theyre feeling
5254736 npr and leroy launched my cancer but its evolved into our cancer
5254737 its a place where patients cancer survivors and their friends and families can have a safe and trusted place where they get support and gain strength from each other
5254738 its somewhat surprising to me that more attention isnt being paid to succession planning issues
5254739 having the right people prepared to fill key positions is an essential business strategy in this time of fierce competition for talent the defining moments in a companys ability to stay competitive may rest in the focus it places on filling key positions with assimilated and capable replacements
5254740 i have held executive level hr positions with several large companies and the importance placed on succession planning was extremely high

5254780 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
5254781 i think there is not enough understanding of the fact that in a democracy how you treat the security of the minority must be a very important part for the success of a democracy you cant only make token gestures and actually let them be in the state that they are as the rajinder sachar committee report shows so what happened is token gestures are made but real issues are never addressed
5254782 i wanted to buy a flat in bombay and it wasnt given to me because i was a muslim and i read the same about saif ali khan now i mean if javed akhtar and shabana azmi cannot get a flat in bombay because they are muslims then what are we talking about
5254783 thats why i am so distressed over what is happening in kashmir for heavens sake it should be brought to a stop and it should have been brought to a stop right when they started that nonsense
5254784 i dont think that the muslim leadership has bothered to clear the air about what islam actually is
5254785 if you are muslim you cant buy a flat in mumbai period
5254786 i could not buy a house and so i think indian democracy is faulty
5254787 mizoram needs it more cut aid from bengal and give it to them
5254788 newly obtained documents prove that in 2003 barack obama as chairman of an illinois state senate committee voted down a bill to protect live born survivors of abortion even after the panel had amended the bill to contain verbatim language copied from a federal bill passed by congress without objection in 2002 explicitly foreclosing any impact on abortion obamas legislative actions in 2003 denying effective protection even to babies born alive during abortions were contrary to the position taken on the same language by even the most liberal members of congress the bill obama killed was virtually identical to the federal bill that even naral ultimately did not oppose

5254794 we worked hard every day but the result was as you see and its really hard to take
5254795 bad penalties hurt us i was talking to dallas coach wade phillips and we were talking about how its like a turnover we have to stop it we overcame them a little bit but they would catch up to us eventually
5254796 were putting ourselves in bad situations just a lot of little things are holding us back no one can overcome making a lot of mistakes we just need to start staying out of these situations
5254797 we had opportunities and we didnt take advantage of them
5254798 we moved the ball and then there was a penalty and that hurt us those kind of things hurt us but i think were going to be all right

5254808 the molecules of life are too complicated or too well designed to not have had a designer
5254809 they used us as a springboard but i wouldnt be jumping out of our skin if i was them thinking that theyre back
5254810 we didnt talk about the fact weve won the last seven times against them i did hear that a couple of times this week in dispatches
5254811 we wouldnt mind playing them every week at the moment
5254812 i think our performance tonight was reasonably dominant and i think physically we were very good
5254813 hes okay he put a bit of a scare in the camp but i think its just a cork on his knee

5254857 this years report card shines a harsh and frankly unflattering light on the attitudes we canadians have concerning mental health
5254858 in some ways mental illness is the final frontier of socially acceptable discrimination
5254859 can you imagine the public uproar if mental health was replaced with race gender or religion
5254860 these figures show clearly the insidious stigma still associated with mental health and mental illness
5254861 these are the attitudes that have kept mental health on the outside for far too long
5254862 these findings indicate that the worrying trend of have and have not patients continues
5254863 ensuring canadians have access to a family physician is a key area for action
5254864 i was just able to gain a lap at the right moment
5254865 nadie se fijar a en la noticia ahora bien si dice
5254866 was not the bill that was presented at the state level
5254867 i think it has to be confronted it has to be confronted squarely and one of the things that i strongly believe is that you know we are not going to as individuals erase evil from the world that is gods task but we can be soldiers in that process and we can confront it when we see it
5254868 ive been thinking about it ever since kyle hamilton told reporters sunday about the disappointing finish in 2004
5254869 i never thought id get the opportunity to be a favourite in an olympics again
5254870 just to come in as a favourite is an amazing experience to do it twice is just amazing and to win i cant say anymore
5254871 i knew that we had won it there was nobody coming back at that point coxswain brian price told reporters sunday in beijing as he talked about raising his arms near the finish line
5254872 we started everything we could in the first 500 to get ourselves into the race and essentially through the middle its a dogfight everybody wants a piece of it said ian brambell of the mens four crew
5254873 we knew that we had a really solid 500 and it was just a matter of not waiting for it but going everyone together we closed the eyes and went for it
5254874 coming into the last 500 we seemed to get our rhythm and ian said go for it we committed everything we had and went said parsons
5254875 we knew it was tight we really had no idea where we were when we started that sprint
5254876 it was exhausting there wasnt anything left in the end
5254877 when we looked over i could see that our bow ball was definitely in front of the germans it was just making sure the judges were with us
5254878 after our first two races we kind of had a tendency of sort of getting caught in the last 500 so we made it our mission to really execute that last 500 and lay it all down on the line and i think we did that
5254879 the women were solidly in third place until the last 100 yards when they were edged out
5254880 it was a hard race i think the first half took a lot out of me for the second half i just couldnt be happier

5254930 i suspected something when i found the first bird in gabon since it didnt exactly match any of the species descriptions in the field guides
5254931 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special you of course have to be cautious but i was still very excited at the prospect of possibly having found a new species of bird
5254932 frankly we considered relocating to china altogether although we discarded that option
5254933 although weve always been connected to new orleans with all of the increased costs related to transportation we wanted to have our manufacturing our call center and our headquarters in close proximity
5254934 we made a big push to keep their back office here but they decided to consolidate their operations in tennessee
5254935 we only have five this time usually its eight or nine five withdrawals isnt bad george is pretty pleased with that

5254951 there are estimated to be thousands of members in the bia family and having a source for obtaining large quantities of specific bia molecules is critical to gaining access to the diverse functional activities provided by these molecules
5254952 but even the intermediate molecules that we are producing can exhibit important and valuable activities and a related area of research will be to examine more closely the pharmacological activities of these metabolites and derivatives now that pure sources can be obtained
5254953 if one thinks of these molecules as encoding functions that are of interest to us the ability to produce nonnatural alkaloids will provide access to more diverse functions and activities by expanding to nonnatural alkaloids we can search for molecules that provide enhanced activities new activities and not be limited by the activities that have been selected for in nature
5254954 our work has the potential to result in new therapeutic drugs for a broad range of diseases this work also provides an exciting example of the increased complexity with which we are engineering biological systems to address global societal challenges

5254976 the governments citizen diplomacy is not about encouraging people to contravene the laws of the country or those of their host nations
5254977 citizen diplomacy is all about rights and responsibilities and not about breaking laws
5254978 there are certain things the citizens are not entitled to for example if you carry drugs and you are caught in saudi arabia and your head is to be cut off what do you expect government to do
5254979 in your call for government intervention you are not saying that you did not carry drugs you are not saying that your trial was not free and fair you are calling on government to appeal to the saudis not to cut off your head
5254980 if they go ahead to cut off your head nigeria will never go to war with saudi arabia
5254981 government will definitely within those rights do everything possible to protect its citizens and address those rights when they are being infringed upon
5254982 but the citizen must also realise that any right also goes with responsibility i think the time has come for nigerians to begin to look at the proper ratio between rights and responsibilities

5254989 there is a big question of where are you going to put this stuff and whats the fault tolerance of the device you store it

5254992 consumers want to know that its being backed up and want to forget about it
5254993 i was in front in the beginning of the race and after 20 laps i felt i had to do some laps easy and then halfway i felt everybody got tired and i knew it was the moment to try to attack and get a lap
5254994 at three laps to go i decided to really go for it i was afraid someone might catch me but i just went for it knowing that this would be my last olympics
5254995 this is something we all dream about as kids and to have it actually happen is amazing
5254996 i was thinking this might be the year i broke through and got a win but at six shots back i didnt think much about it
5254997 i just tried to play the best i could i honestly didnt expect to win at all but thats how golf goes its four rounds 72 holes and anything can happen
5254998 its happened to me and whoever in golf there are no guarantees youre leading by seven strokes five strokes it doesnt matter she played well and i know she was expecting a great situation but shes 19 years old this will probably be a great experience for her
5254999 it probably will be overshadowed by the olympics especially with the aussies doing so well in swimming
5255000 but its great sport is such a huge part of our culture
5255001 i hope it gets coverage down there because we need to raise the profile of womens golf participation has actually been declining in the last five years the more aussies that do well the better the game is going to get
5255002 i feel like i gained a lot of confidence in myself again this year

5255035 dari 196 orang minimal ada 30 caleg perempuan yang jadi
5255036 there are so many people in charge or believe that they are in charge that its not clear if anyone is in charge
5255037 why mr pervez musharraf is being provided with the opportunity of safe exit
5255038 if its a safe exit for musharraf today there will be a safe entry for another dictator tomorrow
5255039 you know hes got a longer track record than that
5255040 one of the things i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy thats what were going to be talking about
5255041 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
5255042 the same old folks that brought you george w bush the same team
5255043 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5255044 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5255045 john mccain has never questioned sen obamas patriotism but he clearly does question sen obamas experience and judgment and they do have profound differences of opinion on the best way to reduce our dependence on mideast oil bring jobs back to america and keep our nation safe
5255046 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5255047 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5255048 im not going to talk about conversations with the campaign
5255049 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it
5255050 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5255051 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states
5255052 i think its the responsibility of the vice president if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else
5255053 i dont want to be vice president im not going to be the nominee
5255054 i think hes nice and i think hes sincere in what he says
5255055 im probably the only person in this town that does
5255056 mccain will have problems getting a high turnout among those voters unless he finds some way to identify with them some way to make them think that a hes not connected to bush and b his economic plan is superior to obamas
5255057 john mccain continues to hear the concerns of rural families thats why he has made every effort to engage these voters on his plans to create jobs and provide relief for working families
5255058 were getting a great response in rural communities that have been ignored by washington and left behind in the bush economy
5255059 its hard for me to understand why obama would fear that
5255060 would have a much easier time capturing the presidency if he had hillary clinton on the ticket her supporters would re energize his campaign it would be a pretty dramatic team
5255061 he doesnt have any experience and i just dont think he knows what hes doing i dont like the way she was treated and i dont like the way bill clinton was treated they tried to make him out as a racist and hes not like that
5255062 was disappointing to all of us who supported her however i think we must have a unified party in order to take back the white house
5255063 strong feelings about his experience and his ability to win in november
5255064 they were both really great candidates it wasnt a huge disappointment to transfer my loyalties from clinton to obama
5255065 i think this is going to go a long way to clean up the ill will some of the delegates are feeling
5255066 placing her name in nomination is a terrific decision and it will help those of us who worked their hearts out for hillary clinton to at least have that historic moment recognized
5255067 everyone can walk out of the hall and say its done and lets get the work done
5255068 dont work this out it will hurt us in the fall
5255069 unless they can figure out a way to pull that together i am worried about pennsylvania ohio michigan and florida
5255070 we might just pull it off i think with enough work we can do it
5255071 how many people have the luck of providing all their childrens needs while alive so whatever good one does to shape the future of youths rub off on his own children
5255072 my dream 2008 is a musical talent hunt aimed at annually discovering young and enterprising musical talents nurturing such talents and establishing them to limelight we at sechi entertainment have observed over the years the abundance of untapped talent in the music industry and we are out to set a standard it is in line with this that we are introducing this talent hunt in order to harness and establish these young talents as part of our contribution to the development of entertainment industry in nigeria and africa
5255073 partner with us to build the man for a virile nation
5255074 what is the importance of this now that you know that all men lie and at an average we tell five lies a day try to shy away from that given pattern

5255079 earlier this year a report by womankind taking stock afghan women and girls seven years on revealed that violent attacks against women usually in a domestic setting are at epidemic proportions 87 per cent of women complain of such abuse and half of it is sexual more than 60 per cent of marriages are forced and despite laws banning the practice 57 per cent of brides are under 16 many of these girls are offered as restitution for a crime or as debt settlement afghanistan is the only country in the world with a higher suicide rate among women than men
5255080 six years after the departure of the repressive taleban this is the paradox of women in afghanistan they now have a say and a position under the countrys constitution but they have to work in an atmosphere of fear and intimidation
5255081 taleban gunmen have shot dead three female international aid workers and their local driver near the afghan capital kabul the three international rescue committee irc workers were a canadian a british canadian and a trinidadian american
5255082 christ didnt come to take sides he came to take over
5255083 today in line with the plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers has begun
5255084 unfortunately we see no signs that the russians are starting to pull out or even preparing to withdraw from georgia
5255085 there is no real sign of a withdrawal so it is difficult to understand what is going on with the russians
5255086 i hope he intends to honour the pledge this time
5255087 the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces or people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted

5255090 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5255091 markets like the hedge fund market that are unsupervised and conduct business in secret in tax havens will eventually cause serious problems
5255092 my visions still a little blurry but otherwise i feel really good any time you get something up there around your eyes thats career threatening thats probably the scariest injury ive ever had it was pretty wild
5255093 i dont think that they would want to hit me on purpose it wouldnt benefit them to hit me
5255094 i dont think he was trying to hit me i think it might have been a little bit of a dirty play they might have been trying to come up and in
5255095 i want him to say hes ready to go maybe id prefer if he didnt have the blurred vision
5255096 if the doctors say he can go he says he can go and davey says he can go he can go
5255097 anything else would be premature time will tell but hes not a guy you write off
5255098 im just waiting for my vision to be completely perfect and im really close right now well see im enthused at how ive responded
5255099 it was scary for a long time i couldnt see anything out of my left eye
5255100 were going to see chinese doctors and i dont know what theyre saying so i dont know how serious it is i had no idea how serious it was or whether id get my vision back
5255101 the guy was mvp of the world cup last year
5255102 we really wanted him on this team because of his makeup his leadership his ability hes a big league second baseman nothing would surprise me about him
5255103 but im thinking about the possibility of creating history the possibility of all of us going out there and getting golds is feasible
5255104 the best way you can raise up your family is to do well and win
5255105 i feel like i have an advantage having steven and jean around because theyve done it before and of course i want steven and diana to win
5255106 im taller than most of the women in my class so expect a lot of face kicks and strong body attacks
5255107 first fight last fight youre going to get them eventually
5255108 when im in the ring its all up to me but were all ready its been a long time in the waiting
5255109 geopolitical chess background to a mini war in the caucasus
5255110 nel dicembre 2006 nato gabriele voluto e desiderato e ora che cresciuto inizia la parte pi divertente abbiamo tutti il sorriso sulla faccia lui compreso
5255111 sono una mamma organizzata e poco apprensiva gabriele abituato a stare con molte persone cerco di farlo sentire indipendente cos da grande sapr muoversi nel mondo io non posso indicargli qual la retta via non si pu tenere un bambino sotto una campana di vetro prima o poi si rompe e cominciano i guai io sono cresciuta per strada dicevo mamma scendo con i miei c grande fiducia reciproca
5255112 pi o meno risponde lei mia sorella enrica vive con noi e partecipa alla gestione famigliare poi c una tata dolcissima a cui vogliamo tutti bene e i miei genitori vanno e vengono molto presi dal compito di nonni
5255113 ci penso dice claudia mia sorella una delle persone pi importanti della mia vita e credo che anche per gabriele sarebbe bello avere qualcuno vicino

5255115 the inflation rate in the rural areas is significantly higher at 23
5255116 over the last 3 years a slow awakening occured in the way i perceive the faith that i have been given i guess i started to think why am i happy to keep it to myself
5255117 i love what is good and i love the god who has freely given me all things good for the sake of his son when all i deserve is his judgement and punishment i want others to know about this life the way of receiving it and their great need to be put right with their creator
5255118 i cant think of any other real purpose for which god has christians on this planet other than to help bring his chosen ones into his kingdom through the proclamation of the gospel
5255119 i have also been transformed in my thinking by the wotm evangelism teaching and wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone i enjoy sound doctrine and the occasional foray into apologetics
5255120 now in my own life i have to constantly keep my eyes on the cross keep remembering what i have been commanded to do and that it is far more important than my pride shyness selfishness self doubting and fear
5255121 ghana is a growing economy and there are a lot of opportunities here australia has a lot of areas of competitive advantage where it can partner ghana for a win win outcome
5255122 to manage 12 000 employees you need offices vehicles and other logistics and that is what we are almost completing to put the programme in a full scale mode
5255123 we are one people and our focus is the same that is to win a resounding victory for the party come december 7 2008 we have to work as a team which is moving forward
5255124 the extent of foreign investment in the russian economy was 22 9 percent less in the first half of 2008 than for the first half of last year
5255125 in the opinion of specialists the latest geopolitical and economic shocks have only increased the negative attitudes of investors
5255126 as a result of the conflict in south ossetia the mechel affair and the scandal around tnk bp we have lowered our prediction on the inflow of foreign investment from 40 to 30 billion us dollars
5255127 after the beginning of the armed conflict western creditors cut and then closed credit limits for western companies thus it is possible to expect a reduction of the inflow of credit from abroad and an increase in their cost
5255128 it is early to speak about a serious blow to the economy of russia

5255131 a free taste would go a long way in making the consumer case for mobile tv
5255132 mobile tv services have taken off in japan and south korea where service is offered free of charge in italy where additional fees have been the norm usage has been limited
5255133 once you start charging consumers they start getting turned off

5255136 when customers purchase a flight on air new zealand they will now be able to make a conscious choice about whether or not to take positive steps toward helping our environment
5255137 the government just at this moment when we are in the run up to the games is actually cutting the budget for the organisation that promotes britain abroad thats visit britain by 20
5255138 the government has made a lot about the benefits which will flow from the olympics not just to east london but right across the country and one of the principal benefits should be to benefit tourism with people seeing around the world what britain has to offer
5255139 all too often you see tourism bodies of governments wake up too late and we miss the opportunity
5255140 by securing the 2012 games for britain we have provided a once in a lifetime opportunity for our tourism industry
5255141 it is now up to the industry to make the most of the games and there has been no change in the governments high level of commitment to helping it do that
5255142 but public finances are tight and we have to make every pound of our investment go further

5255157 we look at october as a critical step in our development
5255158 were approaching it that way were not betting the ranch on the thing so i dont want you to think were just pushing all in using another analogy but with each one of these if you do them well they create momentum and if you dont do them well they stall momentum a young company needs a lot of momentum
5255159 i would expect that you would see that in the next 12 months
5255160 our events are already starting to meet that criteria we have some pretty exciting financial models and i think over the next 12 months you will see us become profitable
5255161 even though its been a little tough for him i think hes had six losses i know the last one he wasnt well he was not feeling well and people still want to see him as long as hes in good physical condition and properly matched with others that people want to see absolutely
5255162 locals think its fun and people who are visiting think its fun
5255163 people take pictures with it throwing their hat up in the air
5255164 ninety percent of the tourists stop and take their picture with samantha and people just love her
5255165 what you do is you just remember you are not any taller
5255166 he is cool and then he is even a good guy not only a biker
5255167 to be in milwaukee itll be like to be in happy days
5255168 i want the largest birds with the fullest bellies to constantly be flying overhead the fans of the bronze fonz
5255169 its a truly symbiotic relationship i give a present to the birds and the birds give a present to the bronze fonz fans
5255170 ma che cazzo fanno sti 2 defficenti in mezzo alla strada
5255171 ang mga taong bayan ang mga tunay na naghihirap dahil sa pagtanggi ng pamahalaan sa ating panukalang mawala ang vat sa produktong petrolyo tuloy pa rin ang ating panawagan na bigyang kagyat na ginhawa para sa ating mga tao the citizens are the ones who really suffer because of the administrations refusal to scrap the vat on petroleum products we continue calling that our people be given a little relief
5255172 gusto ng gobyerno sila ang kokolekta ng vat sila rin ang gagastos may problema ako diyan alam natin kasi na kapag ang gobyerno ang gumastos may leakage hindi tayo nakakasiguro na yung pag gagastusan ng gobyerno ay siyang parehas na pag gastusan natin kapag ang pera ay nananatili sa bulsa natin the government wants to collect the vat and to spend it too i have a problem with that we know that when the government spends there is leakage we cant be sure that what the government spends on is the same as what we would spend on had the money stayed in our pockets
5255173 mamamatay ang pasyente kung patuloy ang pagbigay ng parehong gamot kahit iba na ang sakit iba ang sitwasyon noon mabigat man ang 12 na vat ito ay sa 30 kada bariles na langis pero ngayon na sobra sa 100 kada bariles kaya sobrang bigat na talaga at hindi na kakayanin ng mga tao the patient will die if you continue giving him the same medicine for a different illness the situation then was different while the 12 percent vat might have been onerous it was imposed when oil was 30 a barrel but now when it is over 100 a barrel it is too much for people to bear
5255174 tinitipid nila kami sa pagbababa nila ng presyo sa totoo lang overpriced ang presyo ng langis kaya hindi kami naniniwala sa pagmamalasakit ng gobyerno they are being miserly about bringing down oil prices the truth is oil is overpriced which is why we do not believe government cares
5255175 malaki ang pananagutan ng gobyerno dito dapat tanggalin na ang value added tax sa oil at ang oil deregulation law the government has a lot to answer for the value added tax on oil and the oil deregulation law should be scrapped
5255176 i would engage in negotiations with iran with no conditions because we dont really understand how iran works
5255177 so im not sure if any of us knows exactly where she is standing on this issue but i can tell you this when i am president of the united states the american people and the world will always know where i stand
5255178 you cant have it both ways on this or any other issue senator clinton needs to be honest with the american people about her plans
5255179 cant win elections unless they talk act and vote like republicans when it comes to foreign policy and national security
5255180 they would retreat declare defeat and the consequence of that would be devastating
5255181 its my understanding that there are 20 years of tax returns in the public view from both bill and hillary clinton
5255182 when we endorsed obama for the democratic presidential nomination jan 27 we said we had formed our opinions of him during 12 years of scrutiny we concluded that the professional judgment and personal decency with which he has managed himself and his ambition distinguish him nothing obama said in our editorial board room friday diminishes that verdict barack obama now has spoken about his ties to tony rezko in uncommon detail thats a standard for candor by which other presidential candidates facing serious inquiries now can be judged
5255183 what is the holdup she hasnt exactly made it clear as to what process is making it so cumbersome to just release them
5255184 i hardly have time to sleep but i will certainly work toward releasing and we will get that done and in the public domain
5255185 did they file an extension for the past few years if they didnt the forms are available now
5255186 as a former president bill clinton has been making millions annually giving speeches and traveling the globe what is publicly known about his business dealings is sketchy and clearer disclosure of them is required to reassure voters that mrs clintons candidacy is unencumbered by hidden entanglements
5255187 the median net worth of senators was estimated at 1 7 million and house of representatives members at 675 000
5255188 members of congress who are now paid about 169 000 annually saw their net worth soar 84 percent from 2004 to 2006 on average
5255189 like a lot of americans as the economy did well congress did well but lawmakers did especially well
5255190 no decision yet about his starter for the season opener or for that matter for thursdays third exhibition game against the chicago bears
5255191 when youre competitive you want to win every down and thats a good thing nolan said
5255192 but some downs you have a better chance than others hes the kind of guy that corrects himself
5255193 i feel good about what were doing from a repetition standpoint nolan said
5255194 if nothing else you have to feel good about the depth inside at guard nolan said
5255195 i dont know if its a glitch in the schedule or what to have to start the season in japan and then come out and do 23 games in 24 days on the road honestly its a joke
5255196 if we were in a pennant race right now this would be a joke
5255197 hopefully they can figure it out and they wont do it to any other teams after this
5255198 i work hard but i have no control over how these knees feel hopefully they give me a shot to play the rest of the year
5255199 i think that if i come back and play well and im healthy over the next six weeks i would love to come back here and be a part of this team next year
5255200 i tended to put a little too much pressure on myself and i had some teammates tell me after the game that i have way better stuff than what i was showing out there
5255201 i tried to overthrow i tried to do too much i tried to be too detailed with what i was going out with i just let it get the best of me
5255202 thats why i was trying to do too much instead of trusting my stuff and letting it do its own work
5255203 his stuff was there fastball breaking ball it was sharp it just wasnt in the strike zone often and when it was it wasnt in the right location
5255204 after a start like that you just have to shake it off have a good side session and get right back out there for his next start in seattle
5255205 yes you are my man my entire household will vote for you i am even prepared to be your foot soldier now now i will be your driver when you are president
5255206 wo egyimi anaa you cannot be so stupid ask for money politicians would pay for votes
5255207 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
5255208 a victory for the good guys in the cultural wars
5255209 after years of watching the debate over faith and values in america play out with all the finesse of mtvs celebrity deathmatch we will now get to see what happens when a thoughtful adult takes over from the goofballs windbags con artists and media whores who have led most of the battles until now
5255210 mccains knowledge and strong stance for what is just and right he also expressed a sense of humor that i have not seen before
5255211 senator obama spoke to the heart and mind where senator mccain spoke from the heart and mind
5255212 theres some question is mccain really a conservative really a social conservative
5255213 that was when the pain in my knuckles started and it was dr ayisi ahwireng who treated me free of charge inspired me to continue boxing in spite of the challenges and kept telling me that all will be well
5255214 after a lengthy chat i told him he would become a world champion if he kept his focus i held that conviction because of the hunger i saw in his eyes and the quality he showed
5255215 my good friends we are lucky to have a winning team comprising a flag bearer whose political maturity and sagacity is complemented by the financial and economic expertise of the running mate
5255216 the man of destiny and the man needed at this moment to move ghana forward
5255217 i urge us all to work our hearts out to support his campaign so that come january 2009 he will be the president of the republic of ghana
5255218 it goes without saying that his handsome face and youthfulness are also invaluable assets
5255219 with the help of allah we urge you to do everything in your power to vindicate this great party for selecting you for this very high office
5255220 now my fellow kukrudites our party is fully set for the december elections the destiny of ghana is in our hands and we must not fail the sons and daughters of this great nation who have forged a winning partnership with us since our government has been privileged to lead our country
5255221 we must be as a unified party more than before do not allow our internal conflicts to usurp our strength and destroy the party
5255222 the failure of the npp would be the failure of ghana and africa
5255223 this rapid re adjustment during the last three months comes as some discretionary sellers choose not to enter the market leaving a higher proportion of forced sellers who price more aggressively
5255224 while those who do not have to sell are holding off sellers who are also looking to buy are strongly placed to negotiate an equal or larger reduction in the price of the property they are buying
5255225 in addition buyers currently benefit from the best choice in years

5255361 hanno dei fucili e cacciano e molto noioso allevano anche delle galline e il loro solo interesse tu cerchi delle galline
5255362 tu fino ad ora per me non sei che un ragazzino uguale a centomila ragazzini e non ho bisogno di te e neppure tu hai bisogno di me io non sono per te che una volpe uguale a centomila volpi ma se tu mi addomestichi noi avremo bisogno luno dellaltro tu sarai per me unico al mondo e io saro per te unica al mondo
5255363 la mia vita e monotona io do la caccia alle galline e gli uomini danno la caccia a me tutte le galline si assomigliano e tutti gli uomini si assomigliano e io mi annoio percio ma se tu mi addomestichi la mia vita sara illuminata conoscero un rumore di passi che sara diverso da tutti gli altri gli altri passi mi fanno nascondere sotto terra il tuo mi fara uscire dalla tana come una musica e poi guarda vedi laggiu in fondo dei campi di grano io non mangio il pane e il grano per me e inutile i campi di grano non mi ricordano nulla e questo e triste ma tu hai dei capelli color delloro allora sara meraviglioso quando mi avrai addomesticato il grano che e dorato mi fara pensare a te e amero il rumore del vento nel grano
5255364 ma non ho molto tempo pero ho da scoprire degli amici e da conoscere molte cose
5255365 gli uomini non hanno piu tempo per conoscere nulla comprano dai mercanti le cose gia fatte ma siccome non esistono mercanti di amici gli uomini non hanno piu amici se tu vuoi un amico addomesticami
5255366 in principio tu ti sederai un po lontano da me cosi nellerba io ti guardero con la coda dellocchio e tu non dirai nulla le parole sono una fonte di malintesi ma ogni giorno tu potrai sederti un po piu vicino
5255367 se tu vieni per esempio tutti i pomeriggi alle quattro dalle tre io comincero ad essere felice col passare dellora aumentera la mia felicita quando saranno le quattro incomincero ad agitarmi e ad inquietarmi scopriro il prezzo della felicita ma se tu vieni non si sa quando io non sapro mai a che ora prepararmi il cuore ci vogliono i riti
5255368 e quello che fa un giorno diverso dagli altri giorni unora dalle altre ore ce un rito per esempio presso i miei cacciatori il giovedi ballano con le ragazze del villaggio allora il giovedi e un giorno meraviglioso io mi spingo sino alla vigna se i cacciatori ballassero in un giorno qualsiasi i giorni si assomiglierebbero tutti e non avrei mai vacanza
5255369 io non ti volevo far del male ma tu hai voluto che ti addomesticassi
5255370 va a rivedere le rose capirai che la tua e unica al mondo quando ritornerai a dirmi addio ti regalero un segreto
5255371 voi non siete per niente simili alla mia rosa voi non siete ancora niente
5255372 nessuno vi ha addomesticato e voi non avete addomesticato nessuno voi siete come era la mia volpe non era che una volpe uguale a centomila altre ma ne ho fatto il mio amico ed ora e per me unica al mondo
5255373 non si puo morire per voi certamente un qualsiasi passante crederebbe che la mia rosa vi rassomigli ma lei lei sola e piu importante di tutte voi perche e lei che ho innaffiata perche e lei che ho messa sotto la campana di vetro perche e lei che ho riparata col paravento perche su di lei ho uccisi i bruchi salvo i due o tre per le farfalle perche e lei che ho ascoltato lamentarsi o vantarsi o anche qualche volta tacere perche e la mia rosa
5255374 ecco il mio segreto e molto semplice non si vede bene che col cuore lessenziale e invisibile agli occhi
5255375 e il tempo che tu hai perduto per la tua rosa che ha fatto la tua rosa cosi importante
5255376 e il tempo che ho perduto per la mia rosa
5255377 gli uomini hanno dimenticato questa verita ma tu non la devi dimenticare tu diventi responsabile per sempre di quello che hai addomesticato tu sei responsabile della tua rosa

5255400 the decision to attack was made some time ago it will be in two stages if a smoking gun is found in terms of iranian interference in iraq the us will retaliate on a tactical level and they will strike against military targets the second part of this is bush has made the decision to launch a strategic attack against iranian nuclear facilities although not before next year he has been lining up some sunni countries for tacit support for his actions
5255401 the president has obviously made a comittment to support sunnis over shias

5255403 it was interesting and rather disturbing to see that the south african swim captain was apparently celebrating the fact that i did not win a medal in the event
5255404 an athlete from another country who sat next to gerhard came to me afterwards and told me how shocked he was to see gerhard openly celebrate the result with a big smile on his face what can i say to that but captain my captain i hope its not the typical south african reaction
5255405 as the captain of the south african swimming squad the team feels that the direction in which recent activities are going is not in favour of the national team and national squad
5255406 all the performance athletes had to sign a code of conduct in which we are bound by certain criteria the cut off date by which the contract had to be signed was may 18 2007 the four male swimmers lyndon ferns neethling schoeman and darian townsend would like to have the rules bent so they can benefit without being a part of the team they do not see themselves part of the team in this situation anyway
5255407 unfortunately south africa didnt win a medal although almost everybody broke sa and african records
5255408 it was a young team with lots of talent but the mentality within swimming in south africa has to change in order for the swimmers and coaches to reach their full potential
5255409 then he told them a parable the land of a rich man produced abundantly and he thought to himself what should i do for i have no place to store my crops then he said i will do this i will pull down my barns and build larger ones and there i will store all my grain and my goods and i will say to my soul soul you have ample goods laid up for many years relax eat drink be merry but god said to him you fool this very night your life is being demanded of you and the things you have prepared whose will they be so it is with those who store up treasures for themselves but are not rich toward god

5255419 we developed a series of roundtable meetings and did a lot of research into what happened at socgen and where it fell down and used it as a benchmark to assess our strengths and weaknesses in mitigating risk
5255420 i keyed in on things like identity and access control making sure only the right people have access to the right things
5255421 we strive to have internal controls were small we have 250 people so the key for us is to keep it simple and not get bogged down in red tape
5255422 from an operational perspective when you talk about socgen or the risks to business from an insider its about the lack of controls around specific individuals
5255423 constitutes half of all data breaches because of poor enforcement of access management policy throughout organizations and new vulnerabilities in the enterprise
5255424 large companies have thousands of applications to solve a problem that were built 10 years ago with different needs in mind
5255425 they often dont know who has access to what if someone leaves they dont know what access theyve had
5255426 one of the biggest challenges is in the ugly stuff the integration between systems
5255427 so not only are the applications more complex as individual technologies but also the systems environments are more heterogeneous which results in additional complexities
5255428 it didnt look much if im honest and on the video it looked even less
5255429 when they had the ball they were excellent we quelled that in the second half but they were the dominant force in the first half
5255430 swansea got well and truly humped last week and theyve come back with a real up tempo performance so weve got to go to our next home game with the same intent
5255431 i really dont know that there are that many people with set hours monday through friday
5255432 but this year im forcing the kids to reuse their backpacks
5255433 they each cost 50 they like the special cool ones and theyre still holding up
5255434 ive got two teenage boys and they like the brand names
5255435 they shant expect that this year were a cheap bunch here at this house anyway
5255436 i think if parents are going to drive their kids to school and not use bus service thats already available that creates problems
5255437 those choices have to be revisited just like everywhere else
5255438 i said no but i remained friendly with all three of them

5255441 niet aan hun spel want dat kan agressief en fel zijn maar je ziet het aan de spelers die ook naast hun sportcarri re veel kunnen doen als ik terugkijk naar mijn carri re had ik het anders gedaan ik was veel eerder gaan samenwerken met mijn compagnon rutger van londen ik was namelijk ondernemer n topsporter toch wel moeilijk te combineren als ik rutger toen al naast me had gehad waren we nu 10 stappen verder geweest
5255442 het is lastig werken met een topsporter die heeft namelijk een bepaald doel en gaat daar direct op af als ondernemer moet je naar het geheel kijken naar de toekomst in topsport wordt alles voor je geregeld en wordt je constant in de watten gelegd als ondernemer moet je zelf alles regelen dus ook de rotklussen maar als topsporter leer je omgaan met verlies en leer je door te gaan als het even tegen zit dat is dus zeker een kracht in het ondernemerschap en je moet plannen en structureren dat lukt mij nu gelukkig steeds beter
5255443 many developers make their living creating web sites supplying itemas sandbox to their clients relieves developers of content maintenance tasks and frees them to concentrate on more interesting and lucrative work
5255444 were really excited that development partners like itema are adopting the modx platform and enhancing its value to the community
5255445 what a shame dont turn your back on your grandmother
5255446 were going against the market trend here in a good way we promised intermediaries we would build our exclusives range to provide them with the products they needed to weather the market and that is exactly what we are doing
5255447 it will be a slow and carefully plotted route as we expand the range further but at least its in the right direction we have seen too much market movement in the wrong direction recently and mortgage clubs and networks are in need of our support

5255450 regular punctual trains are especially important to those passengers who dont have any other option but to travel by rail arriva trains wales must continue to work with the welsh assembly to address this
5255451 the safety and security of passengers is of paramount importance

5255455 related to disclosure is the idea of how we make sure not to set expectations around the release that end up disappointing you features that dont make it claims that dont stick or support we dont provide
5255456 thats the importance of fire safety never leave a candle burning the simple act of blowing the candle out could have saved their home

5255461 cinemax declared its 1q fy09 results which were above our expectations the topline grew by 16 yoy as against our expectations of a decline of 10 however the ebidta margins were slightly below our expectations and stood at 15 against expected levels of 16 thanks to higher than expected expenses incurred on f amp b and power amp fuel and film distributors share increasing from 20 of sales in 4q fy08 to 24 of sales in 1q fy09 the net profit was however boosted by the mat minimum alternative tax credit booked by the company and jumped by 8 yoy and 64 qoq as expected the occupancy levels declined sharply to 26 in 1q fy09 from 31 in 1q fy08 due to weak movie line up the atp average ticket price of its properties stood at rs 124 as against rs 131 a year ago on account of the company opening its properties in tier 2 amp 3 cities like panipat guwahati and nagpur
5255462 the company has commenced operations on 2 new properties in 1q fy09 which are at dev arc mall ahmedabad having 4 screens and 1 037 seats and at variety mall nagpur having 3 screens and 1 007 seats apart from this the company recently launched its faridabad property having 3 screens and 732 seats with the release of sing is king moving forward the company plans to open 9 more new properties with 24 screens and 6 453 seats in the remaining fy2009 however with the slow down in construction activity and the multiplex operators dependent on the developers as far as getting the property ready is concerned we believe that this may be a difficult target hence we have taken a conservative and more realistic target of 13 screens with 3 782 seats in the rest of fy2009 as a result we have revised our fy09e estimates we have reduced our topline estimates for fy09e by 27 from rs 2 048 million to rs 1 492 million and bottom line estimates by 36 from rs 308 million to rs 197 million
5255463 two weeks in a row now were not going too bad
5255464 were playing as a team the forwards are playing with the backs and the backs are playing with the forwards
5255465 weve missed that a lot this season its attitude as well
5255466 theres a difference between bashing sides and controlling sides its not all about biff and bash theres some technique as well
5255467 things came off good i ended up doing a good time and it wasnt exactly the quickest course here at the moment so i felt pretty good
5255468 im surprised what do you expect from me i was here in february i didnt see no blue sky

5255471 the only problem i had yesterday was just the last 250 metres the last 300 metres i have no more sprint my training is mostly for a marathon
5255472 also most corporations have spent the last 10 years focusing on tighter controls around the perimeter of networks
5255473 its getting harder to break into firms from the outside in traditional hacking attacks so the bad guys are focusing on how to use insiders to get to the data
5255474 unless you have a need to know you should not be looking at sensitive data
5255475 for instance one policy could be that admins in the it department cannot share credentials with other admins so that theres accountability
5255476 you have to train employees as to whats acceptable and unacceptable and what kinds of things are just considered bad practice such as leaving spreadsheets on an unattended file server
5255477 many companies have policies but they dont have a way to enforce them
5255478 you have to make sure that if youre creating audit reports and generating real time alerts that theres an established process to review these exceptions and address them
5255479 we just touched the surface of the potential on the web

5255509 mccain never called for donald rumsfeld to be fired and didnt start criticizing the war plan until late august 2003 nearly four months after
5255510 mccain long ago embraced the rights agents of intolerance even spending months courting the rev john hagee whose fringe views about roman catholics and the holocaust were known to anyone who can use the internet once the mccain campaign discovered youtube it ditched hagee
5255511 though the mccain campaign announced a new no lobbyists policy three months after
5255512 mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused
5255513 lobbies regulatory agencies on alcohol issues that involve public health and safety
5255514 some of those who know mccain best republicans are tougher on him than the press is
5255515 he doesnt listen carefully to people and make reasoned judgments
5255516 if john says im going with so and so you cant count on that the next morning
5255517 mccain has even prompted alarms from the rights own favorite hit man du jour jerome corsi who swift boated john kerry as co author of
5255518 in 2004 and who is trying to do the same to obama in his newly minted best seller
5255519 corsis writings have been repeatedly promoted by sean hannity on fox news corsis publisher mary matalin has praised her authors

5255526 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimise for those properties
5255527 very small changes that may seem insignificant can have dramatic effects on these toxicity properties
5255528 but most of the compounds weve made have been more potent than curcumin against the cancer cells

5255538 this was achieved despite a significant revenue shortfall from the htec international division where a major system rollout has been delayed by the customer for a full 12 months
5255539 the new jetset operation complements this and will now start to contribute significantly to both revenue and profitability in future periods

5255542 the sad fact is that the majority of the perpetrators and victims are of african descent
5255543 perhaps part of the problem might be that some african parents seem to have either abandoned the positive values and traditions from back home or have a lack of confidence which prevents them from adhering to those values this had led to their imbibing negative western values the this is how things are done in britain syndrome as their yard stick

5255582 the idea that these men believed this young girl was 18 seems unbelievable
5255583 the difficulty we have in cases like this is that the children who are targeted may go with the offenders willingly not recognising the potential risk to their safety
5255584 it is an offence for an adult to take a child without consent from a parent or guardian and we will pursue a prosecution against anyone who does this
5255585 i hope this prosecution will act as a warning to any men who think it is acceptable to take children like this this behaviour will not be tolerated and we will take all possible action to make sure the people responsible are brought to justice

5255824 i reject the idea of demonizing russia i consider russia as a part of europe

5255832 since my biggest supporter and my leader president musharraf had resigned there was no point in me continuing as pcb chairman
5255833 only the president of the islamic republic of pakistan can hold the post of pcb patron
5255834 an emotional musharraf said he wanted to spare the nation from a perilous impeachment battle and that he was satisfied that all he had done was for the people and for the country
5255835 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5255836 he was confident the charges against him would not stand but this was not the time for more confrontation

5255845 political instability in pakistan is not in the interests of pakistan nor the regional or international community

5255858 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront
5255859 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end
5255860 its reasonable to go an eye doctor on monday and then visit other doctors on wednesday and thursday and there will be an overpayment
5255861 ok were going to abolish this this tax law because the peasants are clearly under serious pressure and we can you know use repression to force them to continue to live in poverty and pay their taxes and ask for serious trouble or we can just remove this tax and you know force employers to actually pay a little bit more

5255901 he had a vision of jesus and was blind for a while and changed his name
5255902 well somebodies got to be in charge so it might as well be the man
5255903 the new prime minister yousuf raza gilani who was in washington this week to meet president bush says he is doing his best to convince his country that this is pakistans war but he seems not to have won the argument within his own government
5255904 this complex situation calls for a careful and flexible response from the united states and to its credit the outgoing bush administration is making a relatively good start at fashioning that response
5255905 gillani on his first official us visit since being elected in february was left in no doubt that the bush administration had lost patience with the isis alleged double game
5255906 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5255907 the fact that we have young people over there who have u s passports is of tremendous concern because of their ability to come back into the united states
5255908 we have previously said that increased activity in the pakistani tribal areas gives us some reason for concern
5255909 we have also previously talked about our concerns that al qaida is seeking to recruit western looking sympathizers with no criminal records who could more easily blend in and attempt to travel to the united states
5255910 no credible information at this time to suggest an imminent threat to the homeland or u s interests at the olympics
5255911 i understand there is a problem of extremism at some madrassas
5255912 but to put everyone under this broad net of suspicion is beginning to infringe on peoples civil liberties
5255913 michael mccauls failed publicity stunt shows it is past time for new leadership in texas 10th congressional district
5255914 a nice sound bite that trivializes a very serious issue for this country
5255915 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5255916 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
5255917 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
5255918 and asked about leaked information that tipped militants to surveillance efforts by western intelligence services
5255919 thats probably something the government of pakistan ought to speak to
5255920 we and some of our allies have evidence not only from the scene of the explosion but evidence beyond it that unfortunately indicate a hand like that
5255921 we are fairly confident of what you are talking about
5255922 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5255923 strong evidence and circumstantial evidence of american acquiescence to terrorism inside pakistan
5255924 carrying what were seen as india influenced intelligence inputs had hardened the resolve of pakistans security establishment to keep supreme pakistans national security interest even if it meant straining ties with the us and nato
5255925 not to distinguish between a terrorist for the united states and afghanistan and a terrorist for pakistan
5255926 for reasons best known to langley the cia headquarters as well as the pentagon pakistani officials say the americans were not interested in disrupting the kabul based fountainhead of terrorism in balochistan nor do they want to allocate the marvellous predator unmanned armed aerial combat vehicle resource to neutralise the kingpin of suicide bombings against the pakistani military establishment now hiding near the pakistan afghan border
5255927 pakistans enemy number one and the mastermind of almost every suicide operation against the pakistan army and the isi since june 2006
5255928 the united states military has the capacity to direct a missile to a precise location at very short notice as it has done close to 20 times in the last few years to hit al qaeda targets inside pakistan
5255929 have long been intrigued by the presence of highly encrypted communications gear with mehsud this communication gear enables him to collect real time information on pakistani troop movements from an unidentified foreign source without being intercepted by pakistani intelligence
5255930 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5255931 there is a cold war between india and pakistan they say hands off kashmir we say hands off afghanistan
5255932 there is just enough pakistan co operation with the us to get away with it
5255933 but the us agenda is not innocent either they desire a larger role for themselves in the muslim world
5255934 the isi is going to determine the destiny of pakistan perhaps in the near future
5255935 during the afghan jihad so many things were created by pakistan now these elements are out of control
5255936 the indian statement is not only surprising but shocking too
5255937 some rogue elements in the isi are working against the interest of the country they are being funded by a terror sponsor state the us
5255938 anytime the supreme court called the interior ministry or the defense ministry they could not get the isi into the court
5255939 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5255940 we have received information that nearly 800 militants are waiting to cross over to india at the borders
5255941 the wired fencing at border areas is being further strengthened
5255942 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5255943 mullah rahmatullah tried to show that the afghan government is weak in kandahar
5255944 after the arrest mullah rahmatullah confessed to his crimes and said he received orders and money for all terroristic activities and for the kidnappings from one of the members of pakistans consulate in kandahar
5255945 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5255946 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5255947 what the deputies committee has raised is given the possibility that political fragmentation in pakistan is going to continue do we need to change our strategy
5255948 the argument that we may destabilize pakistan has taken us to where we are right now
5255949 pursuing the policy of public praise and private pressure on pakistan doesnt work
5255950 we need to enhance the capacity of hitting these targets
5255951 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5255952 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
5255953 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism
5255954 abandon the idea that the afghan government will be under its control
5255955 we do not want to be the slaves or puppets of other countries
5255956 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5255957 you are butchers liars and hypocrites you keep on talking about terrorism to the media but behind closed doors you support terrorism
5255958 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5255959 this particular air force exercise is important because india is included among some very important allies
5255960 this is definitely an extension of an arc that has been mapped out since 2000 and it really signifies that what india and the united states have is a strategic relationship
5255961 the united states is very keen that india become important
5255962 indias going to be doing what it wants to do in the area that china thinks is important and a more capable strong india will be able to prevent chinese hegemony more so than a weak india
5255963 we will learn how our allies operate in response to similar threats
5255964 it will allow us to build observations to eventually learn those lessons about what it takes to integrate talk fly with employ deploy and sustain air power with places like india korea and france
5255965 pyongyang through its state run news agency the korean central news agency has consistently and passionately criticized such ventures accusing the united states of harboring hostile intentions toward north korea
5255966 beijing would likely remain reticent about such training since it does not see itself as directly and imminently affected by such activities
5255967 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5255968 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
5255969 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism
5255970 abandon the idea that the afghan government will be under its control
5255971 we do not want to be the slaves or puppets of other countries
5255972 this is not true we have no reports of missiles being fired into pakistan
5255973 it is not clear whether wazir survived the attack or not but his brother abdur rehman and one of their close relatives abdul salam were killed in the strike
5255974 they were three men who suddenly stood up during the meeting and one of them opened fire on him
5255975 if these kinds of operations continue against us in swat and in the tribal areas we will continue this
5255976 it is our firm resolve that we will root out terrorism from pakistan and all of our security agencies are working together to achieve this goal
5255977 reiterated the resolve of the nation to remain determined and not yield to pressures created by such heinous crimes
5255978 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5255979 were being told by western envoys that its not going to bring more stability to have a long trial and that it is in the interests of stability for him to exit
5255980 we are very clear that we have no role to play in this impeachment process britain has no interest in talking about the fate of individuals
5255981 there is a link between musharraf and the army so humiliating him is like humiliating the army
5255982 the us administration would have much preferred to see a workable political arrangement between musharraf and the government not another looming transition
5255983 whoever abrogates the constitution must be punished or we will never stop these dictators usurping power here
5255984 this is a man who stood up against al qaida who will face al qaida after musharraf certainly not this coalition
5255985 the anti terrorist squad of uttar pradesh has arrested one isi agent of pakistan from rupaideeha in bahraich district we have come to know that his name is mohamad masrur alias manzoor ansari who is son of noor muhammad he is native of 154 4 garden west adul jabbar compound near nazeer hotel karachi
5255986 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5255987 extremists wanted to establish their hold in bajaur and the government had to take action
5255988 until today 462 militants have been killed in bajaur and a similar number have been injured twenty two troops have been killed and some are missing in action
5255989 whether i win or lose the impeachment the nation will lose
5255990 they dont realize they can succeed against me but the country will undergo irreparable damage
5255991 i think it has to sink in itll be very different when i finally get back in the fall
5255992 basically im looking for a different challenge in my life
5255993 im 48 years of age this might be the last chance im going to get for a challenge if i want to take it
5255994 sirius would be one of them obviously im not stupid im not going to leave fan unless i have something relatively secure
5255995 i told him if i dont re sign with wfan it has nothing to do with him and i
5255996 but i think in the end this was probably more of a different vision about what the future may hold
5255997 i expect nothing less than to be successful but i understand its a great challenge
5255998 it wont be a co hosting situation it will be my show but i want to have personalities and other opinions and other voices
5255999 to see if things were ok i thought they were but obviously there were things that made it tough
5256000 mikes a strong personality who brings an awful lot to the table
5256001 im going to miss the station the heartbeat the day in and day out buzz of new york sports
5256002 quitting is an insidious character flaw that must be eliminated

5256004 unsere priorit t liegt derzeit klar auf dem engagement in der superleague formula
5256005 ein gro es interesse daran hat das vorhandene fahrerpotenzial aufzubessern
5256006 nat rlich h tten wir uns bei unserem heimrennen etwas mehr gew nscht als die pl tze drei und vier aber die beiden peugeot waren hier nicht zu schlagen das team und die fahrer haben das maximum herausgeholt und den titelkampf offen gehalten das hei t wir werden in silverstone ein spannendes finale erleben
5256007 es war ein gutes rennen f r rocky und mich wir waren hier beide schnell auch im verkehr es zeigt sich dass wir seit saisonbeginn viel gelernt haben gegen die peugeot hatten wir leider keine chance trotzdem d rfen wir weiter auf die meisterschaft hoffen wir haben nur zwei punkte r ckstand auf marc gen und nicolas minassian wir werden in silverstone alles tun um den titel zu holen
5256008 wir wollten hier vom speed her n her an unseren teamkollegen dran sein das ist uns gelungen wir sind hnliche rundenzeiten gefahren und sind daher sehr zufrieden bei den rennen davor hat uns noch etwas gefehlt wir wissen dass es schwer ist gegen peugeot trotzdem haben wir f r audi bisher immer das maximum herausgeholt das wollen wir auch in silverstone tun und die meisterschaft noch f r uns entscheiden
5256009 das war wirklich ein hartes wochenende f r uns mein erster stint im rennen war f rchterlich ich hatte berhaupt keinen grip ich kann mich nicht erinnern je mit dem r10 so gek mpft zu haben im zweiten stint ging es etwas besser aber im dritten stint hatte ich wieder berhaupt kein gef hl f r das auto wir m ssen herausfinden was nicht gestimmt hat und das problem bis silverstone l sen damit wir dort ein tolles saisonfinale fahren k nnen
5256010 wir hatten schon im qualifying probleme mit unserem auto im rennen hat sich das leider fortgesetzt das auto war unbest ndig dindo capello und ich hatten dasselbe gef hl trotzdem waren wir in der lage zeitweise bis auf platz drei nach vorne zu kommen
5256011 es war ein ziemlich ereignisloses rennen die peugeot konnten ihren vorteil voll ausspielen sie haben uns in den ersten zwei stunden eine runde aufgebrummt ehe es etwas ausgeglichener wurde wir hatten einen sch nen fight unter unseren beiden autos die positionen haben immer wieder gewechselt alex pr mat hatte dann einen schleichenden plattfu er musste etwas fr her reinkommen aber gott sei dank sp t genug so dass es nicht einen extra stopp bedeutet hat das andere auto hat kurz vor schluss auch einen schleichenden plattfu gehabt es lagen offenbar viele tr mmerteile auf der strecke herum leider haben dindo und allan dadurch wieder das podium verpasst aber das holen wir in silverstone nach

5256018 we are thrilled that the judge did not require us to continue to engage in the folly of purchasing a 4 2 million condo at a time when we should be considering other matters
5256019 we believe the court injected a dose of reality into a contested litigation and feel that we have started down the road to resolution

5256022 what got you here wont get you there how successful people become even more successful
5256023 the need to win at all costs and in all situations when it matters when it doesnt and when its totally beside the point
5256024 the overwhelming desire to add our two cents to every discussion
5256025 you really didnt need to waste my time with that information
5256026 you also deprive them of closure and in any interpersonal transaction positive or negative we all need closure
5256027 when it comes to determining who held together an important client relationship during a particularly rocky phase the evidence may be fuzzy
5256028 the need to reposition our annoying behavior as a permanent fixture so people excuse us for it

5256030 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
5256031 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
5256032 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
5256033 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
5256034 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
5256035 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
5256036 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
5256037 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
5256038 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
5256039 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
5256040 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
5256041 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
5256042 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
5256043 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
5256044 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
5256045 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
5256046 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
5256047 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile
5256048 tra la la la la la la tra la la la lala la la
5256049 una de las primeras razones en un estado democr tico de derecho es la protecci n de las personas
5256050 hoy es un buen momento para poner en el centro la ciudadanizaci n de las fuerzas de seguridad y no s lo en la participaci n de la gente sino en la estructura modelo y funcionamiento de las polic as y eso obliga a reglas democr ticas
5256051 tenemos un severo problema porque los que dise an las leyes y los que las aplican son las dos instituciones en las que menos se tiene confianza
5256052 ante la desesperaci n de la inseguridad se pone en el debate p blico una f rmula peligrosa porque es una propuesta de seguridad a cambio de ceder derechos
5256053 esto es porque nos fallan seguramente las leyes y tenemos que perfeccionarlas pero tambi n nos fallan las autoridades ejecutivas de todos los rdenes de gobierno para poner a disposici n de los jueces a los responsables de las comisiones de delitos
5256054 todos vemos una escalada de la violencia que puede ser respuesta al combate frontal que el ejecutivo est haciendo al crimen organizado y que tenemos que soportar socialmente para que ese esfuerzo se mantenga y sostenga porque retirarnos ser a una derrota para nuestros hijos
5256055 estamos en un momento donde no podemos actuar con mezquindad todos as est la circunstancia as est nuestra realidad y no podemos ser mezquinos ya los ciudadanos est n pidiendo que se rindan cuentas y me parece que ah no debe haber mezquindad
5256056 la violencia y la criminalidad parecen no tener l mites en un ambiente de descomposici n social agravado por la complacencia e incluso la participaci n de algunas autoridades policiales como ha quedado demostrado recientemente en el distrito federal y en otras entidades de la rep blica y por la impunidad provocada por un ineficiente y corrupto sistema de justicia

5256342 wind farm projects have never been rejected at the omb
5256343 i am trying to decide there are a group of us right now and we have to approach it with an open mind
5256344 theres some conflict due to whats been described as a feeding frenzy for renewable energy in the desert
5256345 if youre going to destroy conservation and pristine lands then yeah how green is it in the end
5256346 were really at the forefront of a discussion that is certainly going to be repeated throughout the state of california and nationally as well
5256347 all of us are going to face this challenge of where to build transmission corridors in a way that is going to impact the local communities as little as possible
5256348 its interesting that we consider some of these areas as pristine and we dont want to put turbines or solar or transmission lines there but they are suitable for housing development theres sort of an irony there
5256349 in five years production of electric current from our facilities all over the country could reach 1 000 megawatts mw
5256350 that is in absolute numbers a volume consumed by approximately 1 6 million people in other words the population of two regions namely south moravia and vyso ina while today power generated from wind is being used by solely 200 000 inhabitants
5256351 in about five years however we will be forced to import it because the two further reactors at nuclear station temel n will still be a long way from finished
5256352 expected annual production at our farm built last year is roughly 103 gwh of electric current that is to say as much as a city of roughly 100 000 inhabitants needs during 12 months
5256353 their overall capacity is to hover between 150 and 220 megawatts
5256354 i personally believe that in a situation when we have sufficient energy produced from other types of power stations it is not good to make it from wind because that is much more expensive
5256355 if such energy would be competitive and we would have a standard market environment without subsidies then we would support such a mode of making power
5256356 the man does not know what he is talking about
5256357 a megawatt of conventional power is being sold at the pan european exchange in leipzig germany for 90 k 2 170 while the one megawatt from wind sells for 100
5256358 the problem is vystr il believes the majority of the people in his region oppose wind farms because they are noisy and spoil the countryside but according to various surveys at least 75 percent of czechs actually do not have anything against them
5256359 similar views are held by prime minister mirek topol nek and minister of industry and trade martin man both ods probably because those two gentlemen are both university educated in energy but what is much more important they come from north moravia the part of the country that is in many ways synonymous with coal
5256360 supporting power generation from renewable sources in the form of guaranteed prices is a standard market mechanism fixed redemption prices remove the inequalities on the market stemming from for instance the fact that making electricity with coal results in a number of negative side effects such as destroying the landscape by mining polluting the air and causing subsequent health risks or contributing to climate change which operators of the respective stations in most cases do not pay for
5256361 the czech republic should focus on those sources that will increase its long term energy security these are for instance power stations running on coal or nuclear reactors unlike wind farms they are not dependent on climatic conditions and also do not take up as much land that can be used in more effective ways
5256362 contrary to what is generally presumed however most of these critics are not environmentalists but people who own country cottages and are afraid that their recreational property could lose some value
5256363 what local operators of wind farms miss and even more so the potential investors into such facilities is simply greater political support both from central bodies especially the ministry of industry and trade and from the regions the approach of vyso inas governor is a case in point
5256364 its government suggested concentrating the plants in those parts where the wind blows most in other words the federal lands of lower austria and burgenland and that once they go up nobody should interfere with the process anymore
5256365 surely nobody will allow our beautiful mountains to be spoiled by some pylons

5256382 the companys current business models root were developing commercial biological technologies and solutions for the chemical industry in the marketplace we became aware of the growing trends towards sustainable eco efficient solutions using renewable resources we saw a real need and opportunity for the next wave after the use of ethanol as an alternative fuel for bio renewable chemicals there is a strong demand and interest for renewable packaging solutions wal mart market news for example has initiated and pioneered a very strong sustainability initiative that focuses on reducing packaging and adherence to sustainable practices
5256383 we went about developing partners and providers in the supply chain to deliver bio renewable chemicals we met cosan sa market news approximately a year ago cosan is the worlds largest processor of sugarcane ethanol which happens to be 7 8 times more efficient than corn feedstock has significantly less carbon impact and is not a competing food source
5256384 we anticipate revenues shortly and are in process of negotiating final agreements we have identified distributors storage facilities and of course have supply in place with cosan

5256563 two thirds of internet users under the age of 30 have a social networking profile and half of these use social networking sites to get or share information about politics or the campaigns
5256564 a significant number of voters are also using the internet to gain access to campaign events and primary documents
5256565 some 39 of online americans have used the internet to access unfiltered campaign materials which includes video of candidate debates speeches and announcements as well as position papers and speech transcripts
5256566 using social media has also grown substantially since the first time we probed this issue during the 2006 midterm elections
5256567 despite the growth in the number of people who are politically engaged online internet users express some ambivalence about the role of the internet in the campaign
5256568 on one hand 28 of wired americans say that the internet makes them feel more personally connected to the campaign and 22 say that they would not be as involved in the campaign if not for the internet at the same time however even larger numbers feel that the internet magnifies the most extreme viewpoints and is a source of misinformation for many voters
5256569 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimize for those properties
5256570 most of the interaction between our compound and the overactive protein comes from what are called hot spots on the proteins surface
5256571 for each spot we can design small chemical fragments and link them together to make a molecule this is what computer aided design and modeling can do
5256572 very small changes that may seem insignificant can have dramatic effects on these toxicity properties
5256573 but most of the compounds weve made have been more potent than curcumin against the cancer cells
5256574 to be able to develop a drug that in the future could have potential to treat 50 percent of these cancers would be a major contribution
5256575 the totality of the research on cocoa flavanols is impressive this is just one more study adding to an increasing body of literature connecting regular cocoa flavanol consumption to blood flow and vascular health improvements throughout the body
5256576 though more research is needed these findings raise the possibility that flavanol rich cocoa products could be developed to help slow brain decline in older age

5256598 son of bigfoot a tale of olympic glory and loss
5256599 mike wins in beijing while uncle bob dies in a georgia bog
5256600 last night in palo alto two scientists from the institute were probing my central nervous system and pondering vivisection while sitting at the bar in the happy hoot owl lounge when one gets a package of dna delivered by fed ex
5256601 well naturally he was excited because when he looked up at the tv over the bar he saw phelps climbing out of the pool in beijing and recognized that he had the same dna as the stuff in the package then when he read the note with the dna and learned it was from a bigfoot in georgia he made the connection it was like being there when newton discovered gravity or franklin discovered electricity or when god created the universe what a moment we started shouting and smashing bottles and got thrown out on our asses just like those other famous guys let me tell you it was one hell of a night for science
5256602 there is no bigfoot creature and if there was michael phelps isnt related to them thats ridiculous
5256603 phelps is an amazing athlete and just because he has big feet and shaves a lot that doesnt mean he is linked to some swamp thing even though he does get along extraordinarily well in water and sure his mom is at the games and nobody knows anything about his father and that seems a little suspicious but still i dont think his mom was mating with some mammoth forest creature of course i can see the attraction but still i dont think its true
5256604 almost 90 percent of all the thrust is coming from the foot
5256605 and the flatter and bigger your foot is you essentially have a bigger paddle michaels foot size and the angle he generates with it play a big role in his ability to swim very well
5256606 in a way that is very very different from the other athletes much closer to dolphins than we have seen for any other swimmer
5256607 if you saw my husband tom watching nascar on tv sunday what with bags of chips and beer cans laying around and heard all the burping and farting and saw how hairy he is you wouldnt be asking whether men and backwoods creatures were related
5256608 theyre hands down buttoned up tight related damn straight personally i think its an evolutionary regression thing women move forward and continue progressive development and men move backward and regress its equilibrium in nature the body in georgia is probably just some guy who wandered off the tech campus
5256609 i think i found jesus on a cheeto as funny as that sounds

5256615 scientists at the smithsonian institution have discovered a new species of bird in gabon africa that was until now unknown to the scientific community their findings were published in the international science journal zootaxa aug 15
5256616 i suspected something when i found the first bird in gabon since it didnt exactly match any of the species descriptions in the field guides
5256617 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special you of course have to be cautious but i was still very excited at the prospect of possibly having found a new species of bird

5256621 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5256622 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5256623 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5256624 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5256625 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5256626 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5256627 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5256628 custom circuits will handle common processing while the digital signal processor dsp core handles encoding specific processing
5256629 home use digital equipment is packed with 1080p image content
5256630 feedback from handset makers is excellent mobile phones smartphones and other terminals mounting the chips could appear as soon as 2009
5256631 implementing hdmi in mobile phones will require a dedicated connector only about half the size of the current type c design
5256632 the target for handset hdmi connectors is about the size of the audio output connectors used in handsets now
5256633 the 19 pin approach is the only realistic choice if were to maintain compatibility with existing equipment i think maybe the only people who say it cant be done with 19 pins are companies lacking the requisite technical expertise
5256634 the restrictions on display size in mobile phones have limited them to personal use until now a handset capable of projecting an image of about 20 inch size though will be an entertainment system capable of storing photos video and other media for enjoyment by groups of people
5256635 the simple structure is what makes miniaturization possible for implementation in a mobile phone well make the control circuits into an asic chip and build it into the application processor for an even smaller design
5256636 so i think were on track to really start improving now its nice we needed that to happen
5256637 its a big part of this evaluation who looks most ready to handle the game make good choices and give us a chance to win football games

5256675 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5256676 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5256677 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5256678 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5256679 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5256680 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental

5256682 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5256683 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5256684 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca

5256686 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5256687 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro

5256872 they each cost 50 they like the special cool ones and theyre still holding up
5256873 ive got two teenage boys and they like the brand names
5256874 they shant expect that this year were a cheap bunch here at this house anyway
5256875 i think if parents are going to drive their kids to school and not use bus service thats already available that creates problems
5256876 those choices have to be revisited just like everywhere else

5256878 gibran khalil gibran fil sofo dos profetas profeta dos fil sofos
5256879 o trabalho levou 22 meses para ser conclu do mas sou um apaixonado pela hist ria de gibran khalil gibran desde os meus 15 anos quando comecei a ler seus livros
5256880 uma contribui o compreens o da vida e portanto da obra do profeta e fil sofo gibran khalil gibran
5256881 a hist ria dele se mistura hist ria do l bano e dos outros lugares onde ele viveu
5256882 se chamava pedro e morreu em boston em 1903 com tuberculose
5256883 foram os piores dias da vida de gibran ele passou um ano e meio enfrentando a morte em casa mas conseguiu retomar a sua vida e continuar a sua obra
5256884 aos 48 anos gibran que teve uma exist ncia cheia de vida f rtil realiza es liter rias filos ficas e humanit rias se libertou deste mundo para encontrar seu criador

5256889 the reason grandparents and grandchildren get along so well is that they have a common enemy
5256890 we believe were able to match brightcove amp maven for the higher end market
5256891 my guess is that this will be seen by the insurance companies as a way to jab us again and then we have no choice but to pass it on
5256892 i think this is a reasonable decision in that it does protect children
5256893 parents have to be careful on where they send their kids but the programs and church groups have to know that they must do everything reasonably possible to ensure that the children are protected
5256894 while this ruling has significant and far reaching implications regarding organizations and businesses providing valuable services and activities for minor children and has the potential to increase litigation and impact the availability of programs to younger members of the community we have no alternative but to recognize the current status of our law and follow its precepts
5256895 the decision in this case is important because it serves as an affirmation of the priority we place on the protection of the health and well being of our children
5256896 if ever pressed in court a waiver isnt going to protect us like a teflon shield anyway
5256897 we just try to position ourself as a business to make sure the kids are safe and thats worked for us
5256898 im sure this is going to be the subject of a supreme court appeal
5256899 court shakes rec providers in ruling on kids safety injury waivers parents sign dont guard against lawsuits

5256904 id feel more comfortable with a judge theres been an awful lot of money piled up behind these cases eventually somebodys going to throw up a test case before the supreme court and then were going to find out

5256916 there is absolutely no excuse for banks not to pass an official rate cut from the reserve bank in full should that occur absolutely no excuse
5256917 it may be interesting to see whether there was any discussion about the size of rate cuts and their relationship to bank lending rates which seem to have become the interest rates that the rba has become most interested in for policy purposes
5256918 in recent times the cost of borrowing money short term has come down and that is a considerable benefit to the banks
5256919 what ive said is that we are always looking at the extent of competition within the mortgage market and if the banks dont move ive said the treasury are examining a range of options and all options are on the table

5256921 this was a tragic incident a family member can never be replaced and it is always painful when civilians particularly women and children are involved
5256922 while it is unclear exactly what caused their death an investigation is under way what is clear is that taliban fighters were in the area and showed a total disregard for the presence of civilians near them
5256923 the taliban use tactics in which they cause civilian life to be at risk they the taliban have no regard for the afghan people and support for the taliban in helmand is reducing

5256951 while the primary objective of a publicly held firm is to maximize profit and shareholder value it is important to recognize that profits are generated through the productive behaviors of employees consistent with the firms strategies and operational goals one way to think about this is that financial results require very specific operational results which we call workforce success workforce success is the product of very specific leadership and workforce behaviors leadership and worforce behaviors are in turn a function of workforce competencies finally competencies behaviors and results are a function of the firms culture and mind set said differently mind set and culture enable competencies competencies enable the right behaviors the right behaviors enable workforce success
5256952 without an understanding of where the firm is to go how it can measure its progress and what is in it for members of the firm little strategy execution will result to execute its strategy every member of the firm should understand the firms business model the role of the workforce and that leaders at all levels will be held accountable for financial success customer success business process and workforce success

5256957 we are beginning a commissioning project for new operas based on classic american literature in the scarlet letter lori laitman and david mason have created something spectacular that should become part of standard operatic repertoire
5256958 the scarlet letter is better suited to opera than any novel i have ever read to begin with its dramatic structure has particular clarity and resonance this is an exciting story about duplicity and love the tragic possibility of america hawthornes prose has offered me several lines for adaptation but my primary goal has been to use spare often lyrical verse as a way of revealing character and heightening drama i want to make sing able lines but also lines the performers will feel proud to be singing i was hearing a kind of music when i wrote which corresponds very closely to what lori laitman has been composing this is one of the most natural collaborations i have ever engaged in its an opportunity for me to grow as a poet and a profound honor to find words i have written taken up and transmuted by other artists
5256959 i am so thrilled to have had this opportunity my collaboration with david mason has been one of the greatest joys of my life his talent awes me and his beautiful words gave me all of the inspiration i needed although this was my largest musical undertaking to date the approach to the composition was the same one i always use to compose dramatic music that underscores the emotional content of the words but that also creates musical lines of great beauty from start to finish there is a consistent universe of sound scored for three main leads and chamber orchestra the opera is set in two acts act i with four scenes and act ii with two scenes approximately 2 hours in length the dramatic pacing of the music follows the dramatic pacing of the narrative and although there are no recitative sections there are several major arias that emerge from the drama musical motives are used and reused and combined in different ways creating a psychological underpinning for each of the characters

5257017 she met lindsay in the summer of 2006 at a party in malibu
5257018 from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing
5257019 but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out
5257020 both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together
5257021 back then samantha and lindsay didnt have a physical relationship
5257022 apparently samantha acted in a paternal way towards her giving her advice and cuddles
5257023 by now lindsay was sending i love you notes to samantha and signing them lindsay ronson but telling courtenay she loved her too
5257024 courtenay would throw fits of rage writing her hundreds of angry e mails from another room in the house

5257047 the survey paints a stark picture of the challenging business environment that has emerged in the uk over the past year with the economy facing its most difficult period since the early 1990s this is now compounded by high and uncertain oil and commodity prices creating inflationary pressures and fall out from the uk housing market downturn which has continued to gather pace at the same time we are seeing a new realism among businesses about the need to weather the current economic conditions with projected staff and capital investment both significantly down on this time last year

5257063 diese reise milibands wurde bereits in den vergangenen tagen er rtert es wurde beschlossen dass es am richtigsten ist wenn der minister nach der sondertagung der nato nach georgien reist
5257064 programm der erneuerten milit rischen hilfe an unsere nato verb ndeten in osteuropa sowie an die ukraine und georgien
5257065 ein solches programm jeden dieser staaten in ein furchtloses stachelschwein verwandelt das dem russischen b ren einen schlag versetzen kann
5257066 slechts 15 procent van de omzet komt voort uit producten die in de afgelopen drie jaar zijn ontwikkeld dat ondermijnt het lange termijnsucces
5257067 the outlook is not good but we are giving the calf its only option it cant be fed and in fact we wouldnt know what to feed it
5257068 it happens to sit in rmps just now if and when it does becomes part of the curriculum for science which it may well do as part of this review then thats where it could sit
5257069 weve had a lot of positive feedback about the dvds which included scottish schools there are quite a number of people who are indicating they are happy to use the resources
5257070 this is creationism with a wrapper on it dressed up as pseudo science these people prey on ignorance and should be forbidden at the school door
5257071 i gauge a growing level of interest from pupils and teachers my guess is that the tis dvds are being used by a small but significant number of teachers
5257072 it deserves formal consideration it presents a scientific challenge to the construct that the world is the result of blind and purposeless forces
5257073 i have no objection to intelligent design being advanced as one theory but most teachers dont have time i trust head teachers to make their own decisions about what is appropriate
5257074 the uk education secretary and the english curriculum authority say clearly that id is not to be taught in science scotland should follow suit
5257075 its certainly worrying id hasnt got any testable hypotheses so it cannot be considered science it is purely an acceptance in a literal way of a particular set of religious texts teachers may be being misled into regarding truth in science material which sounds respectable as bona fide they should be sent some kind of guidance that this is not science
5257076 were not prescriptive as to books or materials we provide guidelines and within those guidelines its up to schools to decide
5257077 there is a distinction between what is appropriate for religious education and what is appropriate for science we wouldnt confuse one with the other
5257078 id is simply the application of design theory to nature it draws no conclusions from religious texts the criteria for design are low probability and high specificity this is precisely what you find in living systems
5257079 i am not a bride nor have i ever been
5257080 but ive always wanted to wear a wedding dress since i was eleven
5257081 especially after seeing the movie to wong foo thanks for everything love julie newmar i have decided that i wont wear any kind of wedding gown unless its red
5257082 most bridal shops dont offer red wedding gowns because they think nobody buys them

5257159 according to our data center provider the power failure that affected jaiku this sunday was caused by the meltdown of a main switch and disrupted the servers of over 8 000 customers

5257161 to be honest a lot of our time in the early going was spent on getting to know google
5257162 we continue to see a very attractive pricing and strong demand for our market particularly for our
5257163 we continue to see a significant lack of supply necessary to meet this demand and dlr is one of the few data center providers actively building speculative turn key space across our major markets
5257164 our teams are experiencing strong demand in the major markets in the u s and europe especially for our turn key product

5257167 what i would tell you is things are about as strong as they have ever been
5257168 i think you will continue to see announcements made by the reits digital realty and dupont fabros for wholesale build in some of our market but again we track those extremely closely and the majority of the capacity coming on in these markets is mid 09 maybe so we continue to be very very happy with what we see as a big gap and find demand still strong in the markets we are in

5257185 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5257186 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5257187 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5257188 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5257189 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5257204 for one thing the kernel is quite complex and big and it inevitably simply takes time to learn all the rules not just for the code but for how the whole development environment works similarly for a new developer it will take time before people start recognising the name and start trusting the developer to do the right things
5257205 we make it fairly easy for people to ease into kernel development
5257206 it seems to be working too we literally have thousands of people with patches attributed to them in each release
5257207 the worst thing anybody can do is to study the kernel alone and try to learn things in private and then however many months later present all the established kernel developers with a big patch that just comes out of the blue
5257208 it may not sound exciting but quite frankly i dont think anybody who starts out believing that they want to rewrite some big piece of the kernel should even bother reality isnt that simple
5257209 of course some people will be alienated and theres no doubt that the process could probably be improved
5257210 not a warm and fuzzy environment where people sing kumbaya around the fireplace
5257211 the kernel is about pretty harsh technical issues and mistakes are really frowned upon
5257212 in an os kernel there are simply more security and stability requirements and the bar is really higher in some respects that will inevitably also reflect in the response to patches
5257213 i think that one of the things weve been very good at is to scale up with a good network of maintainers so that most people involved actually dont work closely with more than a handful of people
5257214 normally the people you find at the core of open source projects are professional software engineers these guys know how to run software projects
5257215 youre definitely going to see more independence on this album i got to work with different people and learn what their habits were and what works well with me
5257216 so youll see a difference in vocals a little bit more personality and its definitely a sensual album
5257217 i definitely think that when i first heard the song from the beginning of the record you kind of feel like you know im leaving it up to you
5257218 and by the time it gets to the second verse and makes it to the end of the song it just feels like im saying i dont want to put up with it anymore
5257219 it was a great first single for me because it said something i fell in love with records like beyonc s irreplaceable where you could emotionally attach yourself to the record as soon as you heard it
5257220 i didnt want something so vague and so clubby because i wanted people to see me as a woman with something to say
5257221 i would say that an official girl is someone in a relationship

5257228 people look over the old heads basically the fans who are over 25
5257229 people look over them i dont thats my wheelhouse my true fans are probably 10 years younger than me 10 years older than me that world doesnt buy a lot of records now but its my job to get them to check for what im doing
5257230 my record is catering towards the mature hip hop fan
5257231 the kids might be able to get with it but it aint just playing it aint just partying its reality to me this album
5257232 going independent in 2006 really re energized me it rejuvenated me and my feelings for the game
5257233 being on major record labels is for the birds it sucks all your energy out because the good ideas you come up with a lot of times they dont wanna do it especially on the promotional tip they follow these same ancient formulas to sell a record you gotta be creative in 2008 to sell a record thats the first thing when i started doing it independent it gave me my swagger back and made me feel like i was doing hip hop and not just doing records for somebody i just went back to the essence and stopped worrying about the hip hop fans and started worrying about ice cube fans
5257234 i wanna take it back to the real hip hop
5257235 it takes a nation of millions to hold us back by public enemy is one of the records i cherish i love i wanted to flip that and put the emphasis more on us and our community on what were doing to hold us back i also wanted to talk about whats going on in the world and how i feel about it and what im ready to do its not a game people playing hip hop like its a game lets get back to talking about what people going through so we can solve some of these issues
5257236 weve established a good relationship with jeezy because hes also in a movie i wrote called janky promoters
5257237 me and mike epps play two shady rap concert promoters we bring jeezy to town and dont have enough money to pay him we kinda got close doing the movie jeezy was like yo i want you to do a record on my album i was like i want you to do a record on mine we exchanged songs and concepts and made it happen we got a heater on my album called i got my locs on we made it happen
5257238 i had to bring out bun and get everything straight
5257239 we took a gatorade break and got everything straight we can agree to disagree but its all love
5257240 i took a verse off my president is black where i shouted out the whole n o shouted out soulja slim pimp c bg bun i summed everything up
5257241 everybody thought the situation with me and pimp was something else but it really wasnt that before pimp c passed he reached out to me and everything was good i wanted the world to know that rest in peace homie
5257242 murdered it esco went in esco is a cool n a though i cant even front hes a thorough n a he went in on the record i dont know what youre gonna think of it i cant even begin to tell you what he said im just telling you esco went in
5257243 im always in the hood im always in the community
5257244 imma say this and be frank a lot of cats come up from the hood ranks and everybody wanna rep the hood everybody wanna say they did this and that when nas repped me i feel a way im a cat from georgia hes from new york city so if he can respect my gangsta i definitely can respect his and anybody around him thats why i respect new york so much and chi town detroit same thing they respect my gangsta
5257245 the hip hop that im used to was the hip hop that express yourself came out of and fight the power
5257246 when krs was big when the bridge is over was big when it was a dis song but it wasnt a beef song when the nature of hip hop was beautiful no matter what the face of it was that day the outcome was always dope man from the spice 1s to the kool g raps thats what i miss when hip hop evolved and changed and got thrown in a bucket of kool aid somebody threw too much sugar in it now it tastes a little funny thats why i say hip hop broke my heart when i got in i thought it would preserve itself long enough to at least let me see the hip hop i was used to the hip hop i fell in love with but it didnt do that hip hop left the job for me to continue on and still pay homage to the way of old me and hip hop be beefing sometimes but no matter what face hip hop makes im gonna evolve with it
5257247 when youre in the studio with wayne you could pretty much chill man because everything is so easy
5257248 if you go back to little lil wayne to now you can see the dramatic changes hes everywhere what the f can you do besides come behind him i dont ever put nobody before myself i feel im the greatest alive i hold it down but wayne hes got it right now so i dont mind stepping behind for a minute until its my turn when its my turn my albums gonna run his down and well go at it again next time
5257249 it doesnt make a difference what youre spending it on
5257250 just to buy because buying stuff feels good the pleasure you get doesnt last long enough to be worth what you lose as a result
5257251 not only are you treating a symptom instead of the cause but youre treating that symptom in a way thats actually causing the disease
5257252 when youve got money youve got choices once you spend it youve made your choice
5257253 we also see a tremendous amount of advertising aimed at making us believe that we will feel better if we spend money on something
5257254 were so busy and stressed that were trying to spend our way to happiness instead of focusing on the things that really matter
5257255 carve out time for the things you really enjoy even if its only a few hours a week
5257256 something i learned myself is going beyond the money and putting a value on the things that youre buying
5257257 if you make 20 an hour and you say i hate my job and deserve this 400 pair of shoes think of that as im working half my week at something i dont like for this pair of shoes does that make sense
5257258 its much more psychological than it is about re using your ziploc bags
5257259 then it isnt just a case of ive got to save money
5257260 but ive got to save money so i can quit that miserable job and do something i love

5257446 those are the people the groups who attacked lanao del norte today
5257447 were trying to convince them to come back to the province but more or less its safe the military has secured the national highway and they are doubling their forces and their highest priority now is to keep the coastal towns safe and secure
5257448 all reserved their rage about the moa signing and they waited until it reached congress and yet the milf attacked our towns we wanted to give peace a chance we didnt comment so much on the tv on the radio opposing the moa and yet the milf still attacked lanao del norte
5257449 theyre very unreasonable and i believe the military should go in hot pursuit of the milf and clear lanao del norte of rebels

5257463 t here are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
5257464 according to recent news reports a top observatory that has been measuring sun spot activity predicts that global temperatures will drop by two degrees over the next 20 years as solar activity slows and the planet drastically cools down
5257465 unfortunately there seems to be a lot of bogus rubbish circulating on the web i make no predictions on global climate one way or the other i am not a climatologist the only thing i foolishly discussed with someone who put a private conversation on the web was that the next solar cycle is a bit late starting noaa predictions are that it will not be getting under way until well into 2009 we concur with that prediction for the climatological consequences of that if any i am afraid you will need to speak to a climatologist

5257481 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special you of course have to be cautious but i was still very excited at the prospect of possibly having found a new species of bird

5257497 allies ask obama to make hope more specific democratic party leaders in battleground states say the fight ahead against senator john mccain looks tougher than they imagined with mr obama vulnerable on multiple fronts
5257498 these democrats 15 governors members of congress and state party leaders say obama has yet to convert his popularity among many americans into solutions to crucial electoral challenges showing ownership of an issue like economic stewardship of national security winning over supporters of senator hillary rodham clinton and minimizing his race and experience level as concerns for voters
5257499 i particularly hope he strengthens his economic message even senator obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs said governor ted strickland of ohio
5257500 its fine to tell people about hope and change but you have to have plenty of concrete pragmatic ideas that bring hope and change to life
5257501 you know what im really not first and foremost concerned with is this person capable of being president of the united states what im concerned about is can he bring me the electoral votes of the state of virginia the 13 electoral votes in virginia
5257502 wir haben uns wacker geschlagen und sind gut in den wettkampf reingekommen obwohl die ersten zwei vorl ufe schwer begonnen haben

5257510 es gibt inzwischen auf blogoscoop 15 weinblogs die nach einem monat ein ranking erstellt haben
5257511 dass viele mitmachen und dass es bald valide rankingzahlen gibt
5257512 man wei ja wie viel traffic die verlage haben aber nicht wie viel die blogs haben
5257513 wir haben keine gr eren pl ne f r die monetarisierung wir begeistern uns einfach f r blogs und wollen schnell und einfach andere neue oder hnliche blogs im long teil finden k nnen

5257520 you may be able to technically fly the distance at high altitude without arms on the jet
5257521 but theres a big difference between that and flying low as you would on a mission to avoid radar laden with arms which takes up more fuel
5257522 you would need the intelligence on targets and a rescue plan this is a very complex business and im certain the iranians are far from having that capability
5257523 iranian pilots are stepping up training and exercises for long range missions
5257524 iran is pursuing a longer range strike capability for its air assets to support the delivery of more powerful strategic weapon systems
5257525 sie hat so eine lockerheit bekommen das ist gro artig
5257526 ein guter ausweg ist die spielsituationen zu analysieren dann kann man die emotionen etwas ausklammern und das herz f ngt nicht ganz so an zu schlagen
5257527 vorher habe ich gedacht ja das jucken kommt aber ich wei auch auf was die jungs alles verzichten mussten um hier dabei zu sein
5257528 ich wei dass ich niemals mehr dort sein wollte denn die zwei jahre vorher h tte ich nicht durchgestanden
5257529 das war total surrealistisch und v llig unmenschlich von uns hat heute keiner ein auge zugemacht
5257530 wir hatten die schnauze total voll als die spanier protestierten und fanden einfach dass sie arschl cher waren aber es ist klar dass ich umgekehrt in derselben lage auch zu unseren regelexperten gegangen w re und mich nach prostestm glichkeiten erkundigt h tte
5257531 sie haben eine gute serie gesegelt und hatten sicher auch das notwendige gl ck f r uns ist die farbe der medaille egal wir freuen uns ber bronze
5257532 martin kirketerp und jonas warrer haben ihre goldmedaille verdient das geborgte boot verschaffte ihnen nicht den geringsten vorteil es w re eher im olympischen geist gewesen wenn die konkurrenten nicht protest eingelegt h tten

5257536 dass wir hier mit vier siegen und als gruppensieger rausgehen ist eine superleistung
5257537 unser n chster gegner muss sich viel einfallen lassen um uns zu schlagen
5257538 man hat gemerkt dass die mannschaft noch einen schweren rucksack mit sich herumtrug erst nach einer zu ngstlichen ersten halbzeit haben wir das spiel in den griff gekriegt
5257539 ich bin ganz froh dass wir erstmal nicht gegen die niederlande spielen ob es australien oder china wird ist mir eigentlich gleich lieb wir haben gegen beide teams bei der champions trophy gewonnen wissen also wie das geht
5257540 wir haben gezeigt dass wir ein tolles team sind ich habe richtig g nsehaut weil ich es so gro artig finde dass wir so fr h und ohne fremde hilfe ins halbfinale eingezogen sind

5257544 bei ausgetrockneter pikrins ure ist besondere vorsicht geboten die substanz ist dann als sprengstoff zu klassifizieren sie reagiert sehr empfindlich auf reibung erw rmung und schlag
5257545 wir konnten aber nicht feststellen ob sie auch eingetrocknet war
5257546 doch gleichzeitig gilt das ersatzstoffprinzip lehrer sind verpflichtet gef hrliche substanzen soweit m glich durch andere zu ersetzen
5257547 ein schadstoffmobil sollte gemeinsam mit den lehrern die altlasten aussortieren

5257549 ob ein deal zustandekommt wird nicht davon abh ngen ob das bis zum 31 august passiert
5257550 wenn die verhandlungspartner angesichts der krise der vorsicht vorrang einr umen und beschlie en dass sie mehr zeit und einen neuen testierten jahresabschluss ben tigen k nnte das teurer werden und mehr arbeit bedeuten aber der aufwand ist nicht so riesig gross
5257551 russland hat ehrenvoll die aggression georgiens gegen s dossetien abgewehrt und beendet heute auf kommando des oberbefehlshabers diese mission
5257552 wir m ssen darauf bestehen dass russland sich aus dem kernland georgiens v llig zur ckzieht und ganz schnell zur ckzieht
5257553 georgien hat nat rlich einen schwerwiegenden fehler gemacht aber der fehler russlands wiegt schwerer weil russland ein unabh ngiges land angegriffen hat
5257554 die georgischen streitkr fte sollen sich auf ihre blichen stationierungsorte zur ckziehen
5257555 die russischen streitkr fte sollen sich auf die linien vor beginn der feindseligkeiten in s dossetien zur ckziehen in erwartung eines internationalen mechanismus werden die russischen friedenstruppen vorl ufig zus tzliche sicherheitsma nahmen ergreifen

5257557 wir gehen davon aus dass die russische regierung wort h lt
5257558 und wenn es zu einem europ ischen beitrag kommt dann gehe ich davon aus dass sich deutschland auch nicht komplett verweigern kann
5257559 wir werden die russische f hrung bitten und sie muss entscheiden

5257563 the softening economic situation has led to a further slowdown in oil demand growth
5257564 oil demand growth will be on the decline in 2009 which will make the world demand growth the lowest since 2002
5257565 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5257566 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5257567 its nothing i can control and honestly i can say it has been very fair to me and i got the biggest gold medal of them all
5257568 im a little sad but at the same time its great to have four olympic medals

5257579 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5257580 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5257581 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5257582 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5257583 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5257584 its nothing i can control and honestly i can say it has been very fair to me and i got the biggest gold medal of them all

5257594 het lijkt me een ontzettend leuk programma om te doen te leuk om waar te zijn is voor het hele gezin en ik ben een absoluut familiemens vroeger keek ik heel graag naar de leukste thuis met linda de mol en later met ron boszhard ik kon er echt de slappe lach van krijgen ik vind het super dat ik nu zelf een programma met homevideos mag presenteren daarnaast is het ook nog eens een mooie leerervaring om een quiz in de studio te doen
5257595 we zijn volledig onafhankelijk in de manier van uitzenden en het kost ons nog niet de helft van wat talpa bij de vorige bieding betaalde de nos betaalt 16 miljoen euro per jaar terwijl john de mol er 35 miljoen euro per jaar voor moest betalen wel komen de productiekosten van 3 miljoen er nog bij
5257596 als we geen voetbal uitzenden maken wie iets anders dat ook geld kost en het voetbal levert meer ster gelden op die weer in de kas van de overheid terecht komen dus per saldo is het minder duur dan het lijkt
5257597 we zijn gestopt met de documentaires we stoppen met engels voetbal we doen minder tennis en geen motorsport meer

5257599 aug 14 bloomberg the chinese government news agency xinhua reported nine months ago that gold medal winning gymnast he kexin was 13 years old which would make her ineligible to compete in the beijing games the associated press said the nov 3 xinhua report from chinas cities game was found on its web site by the associated press the news agency said the story was later inaccessible though the ap said it saved a copy of the page sports editors at the state run news agency declined to comment on the report ap said if the age cited in the report is correct he fails to meet the minimum age to participate in the games the ap said gymnasts must turn at least 16 in the olympic year to be eligible hes birthday is listed as jan 1 1992 and she weighs 73 pounds 33 kilograms according to the olympic games web site an official with chinas gymnastics delegation told the ap that the xinhua report and others were incorrect the international gymnastics federation told the news agency hes passport which is the accepted proof of eligibility shows she is age eligible the international olympic committee also checked the passports of he and other chinese gymnasts and deemed them valid the news agency said

5257602 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5257603 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5257604 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5257605 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5257606 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5257607 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

5257611 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba

5257624 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5257625 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5257626 ive had good training the last month we are prepared for this i think
5257627 until athens i was always trying hard to lose weight to stay below 105 kg but i couldnt lose weight any more
5257628 some lifters take more in training but i need the adrenaline of the competition
5257629 it will be very hard but i think i can beat them
5257630 weve just been paddling and training here so ive been waiting for it to start
5257631 the first heat is always easier but i couldnt breathe i was really tired
5257632 its good to feel that type of pressure though i think it was a good lesson
5257633 if he can apply that tomorrow when the race is cut in half he should easily advance to the semis and have a great going at the final
5257634 ive had good training the last month we are prepared for this i think
5257635 until athens i was always trying hard to lose weight to stay below 105 kg but i couldnt lose weight any more
5257636 some lifters take more in training but i need the adrenaline of the competition
5257637 every day every night youre thinking about it scared that something will happen to your family
5257638 i hope when i go home everything will be quiet and there will be peace
5257639 i love my country so i will do anything for my countrys peace
5257640 its too hard to focus on the competition when you have war in your home
5257641 i called them and they said were good dont worry about us but its hard not to worry you cant see you just hear
5257642 but russian military is in georgia walking on the streets people are scared
5257643 it will be very hard but i think i can beat them
5257644 weve just been paddling and training here so ive been waiting for it to start
5257645 the first heat is always easier but i couldnt breathe i was really tired
5257646 there are 15 people all with the same substance this is the strangest thing because it leads to the conclusion that there is an organized effort
5257647 there is an organized crime because that is what this is called
5257648 because it seems there is a lot of money hidden there a lot of profit
5257649 i am neither a policeman nor a detective nor a judge i dont have that knowledge and i think that the time has come for the state to do something and find a solution
5257650 i believe that if they want to they will find it and i believe they do want to
5257651 whoever does such things gets mixed up in such things commits suicide and when someone wants to commit suicide nobody can stop them
5257652 of course it has to be organized when there are so many cases with the same substance
5257653 supplied to the naive because someone who knows that this could lead them to death doesnt try it
5257654 as for fani it is a fact that they went after her i love fani very much it was wrong for her to allow those who fought her to be vindicated
5257655 i dont hide it at all we are the ones who are giving this right we gave the right we are paying for old sins for this reason the ioc is indeed chasing us it is a fact that they are chasing us
5257656 crucially these are areas that are not represented by waterstones bookshops and it helps us to achieve representation in that market
5257657 small consideration for the leases but that amount is very small
5257658 at the end of the day the objective is firstly to secure their long term future as bookshops
5257659 secondly the size of the stores fits the waterstones offer very well and im sure the branches and staff will benefit from being waterstones

5257664 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5257665 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5257666 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5257667 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5257668 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5257669 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5257670 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5257671 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5257672 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5257673 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5257674 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5257675 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5257676 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5257677 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5257678 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5257679 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5257680 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5257681 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5257682 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5257683 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5257684 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5257685 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5257686 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5257687 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5257688 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5257689 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5257690 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5257691 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5257692 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5257693 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5257694 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5257695 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5257696 hij reed slecht ik nog slechter het was helemaal niks
5257697 ik ga in ieder geval mijn bloed laten testen misschien heb ik een virus ik weet het niet ik ken zon situatie ook niet ik heb nooit wat alles gaat bij mij altijd super mijn lichaam laat me normaal nooit in de steek
5257698 nee daar heb ik geen zin in de concurrenten lachen zich rot ik ben ervan overtuigd dat ik net zo veel talent heb als chris hoy maar de britse begeleiding is een voorbeeld voor veel sporten
5257699 im surprised what do you expect from me i was here in february i didnt see no blue sky
5257700 since i came here everything is perfect they should tell us
5257701 its really good for everybody good for all to keep such clean air thats fantastic
5257702 the only problem i had yesterday was just the last 250 metres the last 300 metres i have no more sprint my training is mostly for a marathon
5257703 i think it comes down to a few things good leadership good coaching having the right athletes
5257704 weve got a young dynamic team and we havent even started yet were only just getting going
5257705 we have got three or four academies now and all of them are going to start producing medals by 2012 2016 so are the senior guys so it should be a good fun four years
5257706 thereve been other nations in the past that have dominated for several years you always get that in sport its our turn now what the rest of the world dont know is that we can keep pushing and keep pushing
5257707 everyones just stepping back and allowing us to do it theyre not giving us the challenge
5257708 were all in a bubble concentrating on our own races and our own efforts but its great to be part of such a great team and we can feel a real team spirit building up
5257709 their domination is stunning we expected them to do well but not so well and not to clock these incredible times
5257710 in the paddock the guys say that the brits have swallowed motorbikes
5257711 you catch the ball you throw the ball you hit the ball
5257712 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5257713 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5257714 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5257715 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5257716 its a very serious issue for households its a very serious issue for business and its a very serious issue for our national economy
5257717 there is absolutely no excuse for banks not to pass an official rate cut from the reserve bank in full should that occur absolutely no excuse
5257718 it may be interesting to see whether there was any discussion about the size of rate cuts and their relationship to bank lending rates which seem to have become the interest rates that the rba has become most interested in for policy purposes
5257719 in recent times the cost of borrowing money short term has come down and that is a considerable benefit to the banks
5257720 what ive said is that we are always looking at the extent of competition within the mortgage market and if the banks dont move ive said the treasury are examining a range of options and all options are on the table
5257721 there is no way in the world we can return to a situation where the federal government regulates interest rates
5257722 vincent w re das einzige gespr chsthema gewesen deshalb habe ich ihn nicht nominiert
5257723 er soll nach dem ganzen hin und her erst einmal zur ruhe kommen und sich in hamburg wieder einen stammplatz erk mpfen
5257724 mit der einladung habe ich nicht gerechnet schlie lich war ich wegen verletzungen lange nicht dabei
5257725 nat rlich ist man nicht gl cklich dar ber wenn man das so erf hrt wir waren erstaunt
5257726 dagegen werden wir uns zur wehr setzen wir haben immer gesagt dass wir alle uns bietenden juristischen mittel aussch pfen werden
5257727 die vertragsgrundlage ist weggefallen das gibt beiden vertragsparteien die m glichkeit den vertrag aufzul sen
5257728 wir m ssen jetzt ruhigbleiben wir sind absolut im zeitplan
5257729 es ist wichtig dass wir einen sehr guten torwart haben unsere abwehr profitiert enorm von seiner erfahrung
5257730 er hat ja auch schon in den spielen zuvor bewiesen dass er nicht umsonst die nummer 1 im deutschen tor gewesen ist
5257731 es ist immer etwas besonderes nach so langer zeit wieder in der bundesliga zu spielen
5257732 wie er den ball von karim matmour gehalten hat war fantastisch
5257733 wir sind schon sehr zufrieden mit dieser guten leistung die mannschaft hat sehr intelligent gespielt
5257734 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5257735 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5257736 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5257737 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5257738 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5257739 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5257740 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5257741 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5257742 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5257743 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5257744 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5257745 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5257746 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5257747 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5257748 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5257749 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5257750 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5257751 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5257752 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5257753 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5257754 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5257755 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5257756 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5257757 russland hat ehrenvoll die aggression georgiens gegen s dossetien abgewehrt und beendet heute auf kommando des oberbefehlshabers diese mission

5257765 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5257766 elle avait suivi au cours de derniers mois un traitement favorisant une ovulation plus fertile
5257767 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5257768 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5257769 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5257770 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5257771 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5257772 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5257773 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5257774 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5257775 this is a planning took where all things are going
5257776 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5257777 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5257778 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5257779 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5257780 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5257781 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5257782 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5257783 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5257784 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5257785 ciel m mes les fran ais lisent dans leurs biblioth ques

5257787 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5257788 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5257789 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5257790 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5257791 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5257792 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5257793 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5257794 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5257795 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5257796 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5257797 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5257798 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5257799 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5257800 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5257801 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5257802 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5257803 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5257804 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5257805 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5257806 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5257807 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5257808 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5257809 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5257810 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5257811 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5257812 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5257813 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5257814 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5257815 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5257816 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5257817 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5257818 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5257819 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5257820 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5257821 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5257822 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5257823 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5257824 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5257825 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5257826 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5257827 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5257828 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5257829 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5257830 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5257831 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5257832 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5257833 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5257834 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5257835 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5257836 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5257837 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5257838 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5257839 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5257840 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5257841 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5257842 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5257843 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5257844 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5257845 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5257846 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5257847 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5257848 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5257849 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5257850 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5257851 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5257852 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5257853 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5257854 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5257855 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5257856 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5257857 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5257858 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5257859 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5257860 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally

5257868 due to the fact that there are too many comments which i feel in my humble but obviously always correct opinion are terribly inappropriate
5257869 our results suggest that individuals seeking stable long term relationships should not seek the highest quality partner available but should simply look for partners who are similar to themselves
5257870 i can talk to open minds but i can not talk to open minds

5257877 well actually i was trying to divert my mind from you unto the shapes of the letters for a change
5257878 charedi communities are unique in that coming out of the closet means proving your heterosexually
5257879 hmmm id rather have him as a friend to go shopping with and share all sorts of stuff with but no way in hell am i going out with him
5257880 no way im going to reveal myself im top secret how can i frame myself im undercover
5257881 i just try to seem that way sometimes fool even myself
5257882 but i do have a problem with dating a gay guy call me old fashioned if you like but i do i have a problem with both of us admiring the waiter i have a problem with him being overly interested in my lipstick i have a problem with always wondering if he wishes he was wearing my clothes i have problems with all these things i want to be the girl in the relationship dammit
5257883 i dunno but it says it in the torah so uh um i dunno
5257884 if one puts forward an idea to a true englishman always a rash thing to do he never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong the only thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it oneself now the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it indeed the probabilities are that the more insincere the man is the more purely intellectual will the idea be as in that case it will not be coloured by either his wants his desires or his prejudices however i dont propose to discuss politics sociology or metaphysics with you i like persons better than principles and i like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world
5257885 it is only 1 project with a preset aim being done a research team that has an intrest in proving it to be correct they are all gay
5257886 if it was respectable work in the field it would have been published in respected scientific journals
5257887 there arent as many genuine gays as people think but a tiny percentage of the population
5257888 the important thing to remember is that whatever you decide you are always a jew and you can also be frum
5257889 if you want to know how the gedolim of the past were look at the way they are now it was always the same
5257890 in any case the torah doesnt care much for personal happiness in fact there is no real word for happiness in hebrew the jewish system is one of moral absolutism which means probably that it doesnt matter whether one is happy or not as long as he she it is moral
5257891 it would be better for man not to have been created
5257892 i never said that r moshe or anyone else would be more lenient when it comes to homosexuality
5257893 id like a source for your assertion that two men cannot kiss each other all the torah forbids is gay sex nothing else you are about as thick headed as a brick so i am done debating with you
5257894 if in a prohibited relationship there is closeness of flesh but no intercourse the punishment is malkos

5257916 there is nothing with which every man is so afraid as getting to know how enormously much he is capable of doing and becoming
5257917 a new king arose over egypt who didnt know joseph

5257919 you are the messiah the son of the living god
5257920 we may have started out on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
5257921 were both democrats we both share a lot of the same values and hopes for our country we know what a difference a democratic president will make to everything we believe in

5257926 the inquirer article reports that a parish in bucks county pennsylvania directly benefitted from a delaware state law the child victims act the child victims act was enacted on july 10 2007 and it removes the statute of limitations for child victims of sexual abuse to bring forth civil claims the law is also retroactive a child victim previously barred because of an expired statute of limitations was granted a two year window from the date the law was enacted to bring forth a claim similar legislation in pennsylvania has stalled we can thank delaware for watching out for pennsylvanias children
5257927 we are working at the ultimate edge of what is possible progressing toward advanced next generation semiconductor technologies
5257928 this new development is a critical achievement in the pursuit to continually drive miniaturization in microelectronics
5257929 we only have five this time usually its eight or nine five withdrawals isnt bad george is pretty pleased with that
5257930 it is disappointing because it is the early part of the season and you would look to have all your players available when preparing for a world cup qualifier
5257931 all have genuine injuries and are struggling to play the doctors have had a look at them
5257932 its very early in the season but george went to see him against motherwell a fortnight ago and he did extremely well
5257933 i watched the game against rangers and he was on top of his game again he is maturing as a player and we felt it was right to introduce him and give him an opportunity
5257934 het zijn de kleuren van spanje daarom dat oranje een teken van protest ik weet van niets ik heb respect voor iedereen met politiek wil ik me echt niet inlaten de bandana en de polsband zijn trouwens geel denk ik maar als ik zweet wordt het al snel oranje
5257935 dat belgi nog geen medaille heeft kunnen behalen op deze spelen wakkert de verwachtingen naar ons toe natuurlijk nog aan
5257936 wij fixeren ons echter niet op het brons we gaan eerst en vooral voor een finale en daarin proberen we dan een belgisch record te lopen als we daarin slagen is een mooie plaats niet veraf

5257938 de concurrentie is net het enige wat we niet onder controle hebben als we naar de anderen zouden kijken zou dat alles nog veel vermoeiender maken
5257939 we hebben gezien dat onze aflossingen op de laatste trainingen heel goed waren alle kleine problemen zijn onder controle en we zijn allemaal in vorm dus we zijn er helemaal klaar voor
5257940 het is zo goed als opgelost dus ik zal 200 kunnen voluit gaan
5257941 de aannemer kan dan de volgende dagen en weken rustig alles opruimen
5257942 we waren inderdaad op een laag dak geraakt waar we verder omhoog konden klimmen maar we hebben geen risicos willen nemen

5257945 de beelden van bombardementen in georgi kunnen perfect naast beelden van doel geplaatst worden ook hier wordt alles plat gegooid
5257946 ik ga er niet om liegen ik maak me wel degelijk zorgen want gezien er geen nieuwe boeken meer komen zullen de verwachtingen niet zo hoog gespannen zijn het zou pas echt erg zijn mocht er niemand komen opdagen
5257947 hirax is excited and ready to play this concert we have been notified by the promoters that the advance ticket sales have been great so we expect this show to be totally crazy

5257960 formeel moeten wij handelen als het strafbare feit gepleegd is er is pas sprake van smaad als de rechter daarover geoordeeld heeft niet als de advocaat van de tegenpartij met veel bombarie om verwijdering van onwelgevallige teksten vraagt
5257961 die is niet in eerste instantie verantwoordelijk voor het gedrag van zijn gasten maar in de praktijk komt het steeds vaker voor dat providers al van tevoren handelen dat heeft ook te maken met de internationale context smaad bijvoorbeeld wordt in veel landen ook binnen europa strafrechtelijk verschillend gedefinieerd providers nemen geen risico ze zijn het juridische afvoerputje van nederland

5257967 trinidad and tobago would seek economic integration by 2011 and political integration by 2013 with any or all of the nine members of the organisation of east caribbean states
5257968 nobody even knew this was under discussion its exactly the sort of process which will ensure that the scheme doesnt work policy announced from the top to a cynical population without even being properly thought out
5257969 looking for all intents and purposes like hes giving the people of trinidad and tobago a great big meggie
5257970 if the meg means that he was only kicksing about there not being a dengue outbreak or that trinbagonians deserve a big meggie for thinking they deserve a minister of health who actually has a clue
5257971 in the absence of tourist offices where a cuban citizen can arrange in cuban pesos an excursion in his own country private resourcefulness has addressed this market niche

5258083 we have played four matches so far in the africa cup of nations and the world cup qualifiers and have won all but i believe we still need to play some friendly matches which will give us some advantage we should not take things for granted
5258084 we have beaten highlanders before and now this is a repeat
5258085 i think this win builds more confidence in the boys and boosts their morale in the next matches
5258086 i happy that we have played well and this was a good game for us i am pleased with the result but we still have to work hard in the next game
5258087 in my opinion this was a much improved game than before
5258088 so i am happy that we played well and created chances but obviously we are not happy to lose
5258089 now i think the coaches should work on improving precision seeing that we can create chances
5258090 this is the highlight of the year in terms of competitions and to have come first ahead of such a strong field represents a great success
5258091 the band played really well and is a great springboard for even more great performances in the future
5258092 we are still a relatively young band and we have come a long way in terms of our performances
5258093 i have taken a keen interest in the formation and development of the band and have seen them play at a variety of events and functions
5258094 thats omar hes the new brown boy on my team
5258095 oh kellen told me they had a new boy named omar on the team and that hes a really good player he was so excited to have him try out
5258096 and at exactly that moment kellen tripped over a blade of grass with no one anywhere near him and fell flat on his face and i burst out laughing and said
5258097 congratulations were not sure if it will be the a team or b team but the coach wants to offer lamar a spot
5258098 lamar lamar and ive been calling him omar this whole time why didnt either of you correct me

5258112 well be working hand in hand with our neighbors on many common interests
5258113 by working together and sharing our knowledge we can address medical and engineering concerns common to the region while also demonstrating our commitment to developing cooperative solutions and fostering lasting bonds of friendship
5258114 the cooperation between the different nations non governmental organizations and host nation citizens in this mission will benefit us greatly
5258115 should a disaster ever strike this area we will be able to build upon the care clinical information and cooperation were working on now
5258116 by working alongside our partners here making renovations and repairs and building a better relationship with the nation we will establish a great bond between our two nations
5258117 we are very proud to be a part of this mission and focused on not only helping our neighbors but also learning from them
5258118 if you dont wanna see it dont look turn your head away
5258119 well of course anyone whos ever been asked to be on a commission the biggest concern you have is whether or not your commissions paper will become a doorstop in some congressmans office so we outsmarted them this time we didnt publish the report we put it on the internet
5258120 our job was to surface these issues and at least to lay out what the challenges would be
5258121 the publics not going accept higher fuel taxes and other fees if the system is not overhauled
5258122 but you go out and you do polling and you say will you pay a higher gas tax the first answer youd get is are you crazy gas is 3 25 3 50 a gallon no way but if you go and say if we can reduce your commute time by ten minutes would you accept a nickel a gallon increase over the next five years the polling looks a lot different
5258123 the amount of public transit that america already uses saves over 4 2 billion gallons of fuel a year its 37 million metric tons of less carbon that goes into the air
5258124 makes a very strong case for the investment in infrastructure being absolutely necessary and having worked in the railroad industry in the past if you let the industry investment slide down it will have a huge effect on trade and the economic competitiveness of the nation and the region i think chicagos infrastructure issues are nationally recognized and im sure well see a good share of what comes forward

5258150 years ago a missionary from africa was visiting new york city it was in the days before cars had turn signals and drivers were expected to place their hand out of the window to signal a turn
5258151 the judge immediately dismissed the case why did you do that
5258152 the police officer was right to give me the ticket i did not have my hand out i find that difficult to believe
5258153 when my wife and i first met we did not imagine that our relationship would be similar to that of barack obamas parents
5258154 everyone wants to label our children obama indeed we wish our children could grow up to be like him so they can be a bridge between the races in the us
5258155 i feel like mr obama has opened the door to ending racism and hope that we will start to look at people as individuals and not place anyone within a group with stereotypes
5258156 our seven year old daughter is aware that mr obama comes from a similar background as hers she is starting to know that no matter ones background you can make a difference
5258157 though my four year old boy is called alex he has been nicknamed obama by neighbours
5258158 immigrants especially those of african descent have found a new impetus to raise kids in america in expectation of a repeat of the obama phenomenon
5258159 i have to be in denver to witness history being made this is a defining moment in our history
5258160 if he wins he will engage leaders here and abroad to find solutions to controversial issues and give our children a more positive future
5258161 were it not for work commitments i would have gone i am sure many kenyans will attend while many more will be glued to their television sets to witness history being made
5258162 the general election is coming up sooner than you think
5258163 time flies when youre building the largest grassroots campaign in the history of presidential politics and thats why we need to act now to organise communities and build this movement for change
5258164 all you need is a hunger for change and a willingness to turn your enthusiasm into action
5258165 i am sure i will make the trip to denver to be part of this history making process i will not vote in november so the best chance for me is to attend and hear mr obamas acceptance speech
5258166 i have yet to make a contribution but plan to do so in the last three months of the campaign
5258167 i will be away in kenya doing some consultancy work but will cast an absentee ballot before i leave
5258168 i consider fear and loathing in las vegas to be comfort reading i like the al pastor tacos at tacos mexico and i count among my literary influences the chainsaw from doom
5258169 i started nursery know it all to give new and expectant parents the support and confidence they need so that they can concentrate on a more important role parenting
5258170 with everything online these days parents spend a lot more time than theyd like just researching ideas products and things to be aware of
5258171 but nursery know it all has already tried these products sifted through information and spent the countless hours doing this legwork for them
5258172 with more dual income households families being spread out and our lives getting busier parents are finding themselves stressed out by the to do list for parenthood
5258173 a service like nursery know it all means that busy parents get to spend more quality time with each other enjoying pregnancy rather than spending countless hours researching and searching for products services and childcare
5258174 my husband and i found all the new baby things a parent needs to buy so overwhelming nursery know it all provided us with helpful advice and guidance and it was an unbelievable time saver it was a more personalized experience unlike just reading a book
5258175 as a first time mom i spent hours pouring over all of the books that recommend the best baby products but once i walked into the store i was so overwhelmed and confused kim took me through everything she helped me choose products based on what i needed now and what id need six months from now ive since had my second child and again used the services of nursery know it all to better understand what i need and dont need for two young children
5258176 as a mother of three young children i know how stressful having a baby can be not only are you adapting to your new role of motherhood and the changing family dynamic whether its your first or your fifth child but the little things like thank you cards researching childcare options and buying things like cribs and strollers can take hours of time to research and can get really overwhelming
5258177 a few people have rung me up in the last couple of days but ive never spoken to anybody about it
5258178 kui vaadata mida oleme realiseerinud siis k siraamatute kirjastus mille ostsime annab kasumit meditsiinileht on jooksvatelt kuludelt tuludelt j udnud nulli teisel poolaastal loodame saavutada siin kasumit muude toodete osas on praegu vara hinnata

5258182 we believe in the separation of church and state but that doesnt mean we still cant have faith working in state
5258183 we both like to play for our country it is a great honour for us so now we have a friendly match with belarus and we go away very happy
5258184 we come back on thursday night which is near the bolton match but we will be prepared to play
5258185 its very important for us to be backed like that
5258186 they came in great numbers and i hope it continues in all of the matches the fans were extremely loud and could be heard by us
5258187 we need them and want to show them more performances like this
5258188 fabricio enjoyed the match it was a great start for him and the rest of the team he is looking forward to more like i am
5258189 he definitely earned it and i think hell be a major success there
5258190 i think itll take him a few months before he has really settled in down here
5258191 i can appreciate how long that takes and he is a couple of years younger than me too
5258192 he has also gone to a big club but once he is settled hell force his way in to their team and do really well
5258193 an analysis of the command and control structure of the combined action program cap
5258194 i am always skeptical about statistics showing improvements in pacification they were too easily manipulated to present a rosy picture ideally there would be a source or sources that would substantiate fmfpacs claims but i am willing to concede that none probably exists
5258195 too much credit to the caps individual cap units may have played a valiant role but i believe it is hyperbole to attribute to them the failure of the enemy offensive at da nang at da nang the enemy troops jumped the gun and their efforts were poorly coordinated
5258196 when this cap unit got overrun during tet they lost a lot of respect for us
5258197 it seems like they respected us because they felt that we as a small force would run and we fought back they thought we were pretty brave for what we did
5258198 there appears to have been a bureaucratic battle over turf
5258199 the sergeant told the col onel what the co wanted to hear
5258200 i definitely feel that the marine coming into the cap need edj combat experience especially in patrolling and ambush and good nco leadership because they were on their own most of the time
5258201 apparent undesirability of receiving marines without previous combat experience is not valid inexperienced marines in the caps did exactly what their ounterparts in the infantry battalions did they learned from their peers ncos and officers
5258202 the real trouble is that bigbelly is generating compacted trash and that brings its own set of problems compacted trash is great if youre looking to fit the maximum amount of waste into collection trucks or landfills but the flipside of that benefit is that now your landfills get no oxygen since theyre so perfectly compacted and without oxygen you dont get decomposition you get preservation so landfills end up being giant storage heaps for trash which again is fine if you want to keep the stuff but wasnt getting rid of it the point of making it trash in the first place
5258203 cost of driving is based on the average mileage for the shortest route between your start and end addresses multiplied by the cost per mile that the irs allows businesses to deduct
5258204 are based on an annual study of the fixed and variable costs of operating an automobile
5258205 if you have a two car household with two adults who work outside the home and both of them drive separately if just one of those adults started to commute by transit theyd save 10 percent of their carbon footprint
5258206 thats more than if they buy a new energy efficient refrigerator and change their lightbulbs out to compact fluorescents and insulate their home i dont think people understand how just little changes wouldnt destroy the american way of life as some critics would have you believe but would make an enormous difference in these kind of big environmental issues
5258207 feel the heat global warming and the environment are for real
5258208 we all need to do something to save our environment
5258209 did the doors open for your guys right onto the tracks
5258210 you dont expect the doors to open and there to be nothing
5258211 im usually not the first person out of the car but this morning
5258212 you could have just walked out and fallen ten feet onto the tracks
5258213 its the same size same coloration down to a small mark on its lower tail fin
5258214 another one might come out but you cant be afraid of everything
5258215 im here every day for five or six years and i have never had anything like today
5258216 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5258217 growing high quality fruit is not easy but if you are determined you can do anything difficult
5258218 i have grown dragon fruit for a dozen years and have just been waiting for this chance
5258219 it is hard work but thats the price for getting rich
5258220 i have all this accumulated knowledge and experience and no one wants to employ it and im not sure why
5258221 that im of no further use to my country is why im considering australia that my former parliamentary colleagues seem not to want to appoint me to anything but are quite happy to accommodate others who have left or are about to so as to shut them up from whingeing from the sidelines in election year
5258222 die mauteinnahmen werden dringend f r die finanzierung der verkehrswege gebraucht ohne die anpassung der lkw maut an die von ihm verursachten wegekosten fehlen im n chsten jahr f r alle verkehrswege dreistellige millionenbetr ge
5258223 aus den lkw mauteinnahmen sollen im n chsten jahr auch 1 1 milliarden euro in die bundesschienenwege investiert werden w rde die f r den 1 januar 2009 vorgesehene mauterh hung ausgesetzt fehlten rund 300 millionen euro f r die schieneninfrastruktur der ohnehin viel zu z gerliche ausbau der schieneninfrastruktur k me nahezu vollst ndig zum erliegen
5258224 die stra e kann die mobilit tsprobleme der zukunft allein nicht l sen schon aus klimapolitischer sicht w re es ein wahnsinn die lkw mauteinnahmen zuk nftig zu 100 prozent f r den stra enbau auszugeben wie es der hessische verkehrsminister alois riehl verlangt wer die mautanteile f r die schieneninfrastruktur und die wasserstra en kappen will der verabschiedet sich von einer integrierten und damit nachhaltigen verkehrspolitik
5258225 wer bei den lkw das prinzip der nutzerfinanzierung zur ckstutzen will muss der wirtschaft und industrie im gleichen atemzug erkl ren k nnen wo dann die infrastrukturinvestitionen herkommen sollen auch bei der bahnindustrie geht es um tausende arbeitspl tze wenn auf einmal 1 1 milliarden euro fehlen
5258226 das ergebnis ist ausdruck der breiten unterst tzung der firmen f r die arbeit die die ihk in enger kooperation mit dem unternehmerischen ehrenamt geleistet hat und leistet
5258227 ziel der ihk arbeit in den kommenden f nf jahren wird es unter anderem sein die kleineren firmen mit bis zu 50 mitarbeitern noch st rker einzubinden und gerade dieser klientel die geldwerten vorteile der ihk arbeit n her zu bringen
5258228 das release habe ich von grund auf neu erstellt in anderen worten ich habe nicht nur einige nderungen in sls eingebaut und das als neues release bezeichnet
5258229 you would think that the pms four months in office and the role he played in restoring peace to kenya and reconciling our people would have finally shamed into silence all of mr odingas demonisers
5258230 more extreme communist position openly advocated by and identified with oginga odinga
5258231 respond to these smears forcefully with all the means at our disposal
5258232 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
5258233 if obama were to be involved in kenyan politics as us president would his political goal simply be to stop violence such as that which erupted after the recent election
5258234 or would obama seek to advance the same policy goals that his tribesman odinga has in his co presidency with kibaki
5258235 if obama continues to support odinga as prime minister is he therefore accepting or condoning the post election violence that brought odinga to power and a radical agenda from the left that would expand islam in kenya
5258236 barack obama introduced himself to the american public with a book about his father
5258237 the obama family in africa is a muslim family of the predominantly christian luo tribe in the predominantly christian country of kenya
5258238 the young audiences we target have responded really positively to the changes weve made to bbc3 this year
5258239 mit der berufung dieses erfahrenen und in der branche anerkannten touristikers unterstreichen wir nicht zuletzt die bedeutung die nach wie vor das gesch ft mit den reiseveranstaltern f r uns hat

5258243 estamos en contra de la agresi n que estados unidos lanz en el c ucaso utilizando las tropas de georgia
5258244 hay tropas rusas de paz con varios a os all autorizadas por naciones unidas me cuenta putin por tel fono hace tres d as c mo arrollaron sorprendieron a las tropas rusas de paz los aniquilaron degollaron mataron mujeres ni os incendieron ciudades pueblos enteros una provocaci n del imperio tratando de sabotear adem s las olimpiadas
5258245 echaron abajo un gobierno desestabilizando a un pa s y pusieron all a un presidente el actual presidente de georgia no es sino un t tere del imperio norteamericano
5258246 los rusos hicieron lo que ten an que hacer vaya nuestro reconocimiento al coraje del presidente dmitri medv dev del primer ministro vladimir put n y de la patria rusa estamos con rusia as como estamos con china
5258247 rusia se puso de pie de nuevo y eeuu tiene un plan para frenar el levantamiento de la nueva rusia est n tratando de bloquear a rusia de rodearla de frenarla igual contra nosotros igual contra ir n igual contra am rica del sur est n tratando de frenar la resurrecci n de los pueblos
5258248 hace poco bush dijo que eeuu quer a que georgia entrara en la otan imag nense ustedes lo que eso significa la otan en el l mite mismo de rusia entre el mar b ltico y el mar negro
5258249 un ataque contra cualquier miembro de la otan es un ataque contra todos
5258250 los yankees no contaban con la respuesta rusia pensaban que se iban a quedar con los brazos cruzados los rusos hicieron lo que ten an que hacer
5258251 at the heart of our portal is that you can get a lot of information from the community
5258252 theres been user generated content in investing for a long time but its been in the form of discussion boards
5258253 with discussion boards things tend to fall off the bottom of the page and theres little incentive to make a really good post our site gives people a platform where they can share their knowledge
5258254 weve put in mechanisms to help prevent stuff like that
5258255 people are encouraged to build a long term reputation on the site
5258256 the only people who bother to spend a lot of time writing are the people who actually know something about the topic
5258257 i was frustrated that the personal finance blogosphere didnt really have a center spot
5258258 so i began putting together a catalog of personal finance blogs with listings by topic i came up with a framework that i hoped would make it easier for readers to find out the main theme of a blog i gave the opportunity for people to list their main topics give a summary of their blogs purpose and their views and even link to their best posts i hoped that this would be useful for readers to find blogs which fit what they were looking for and that bloggers would be willing to participate because it was free advertising
5258259 now that the former part is doing well id like to get more personal finance information itself on the site
5258260 sort of a stage two what are index funds what is a 401 k
5258261 i think its currently unique for its focus on the blogosphere for both bloggers and readers
5258262 there are lots of great finance facts in for example but nothing ive seen about personal finance blogs accumulating finance information is only one of the finwikians goals the main goal being to link people to sites which will provide them a more daily dose if they subscribe
5258263 people like to have a voice and they like flexibility
5258264 nothing is static on a wiki you can add your own blog listing or point of view to a topic then readers like to be able to find information quickly i hope people like this one because it helps them find useful information even if thats not on the wiki itself

5258283 this is a big new step for our company and our investors
5258284 now we are the government so fuck you try to stop us mwahaha
5258285 and as a dead man how exactly are you planning to enforce all of this
5258286 they readers finally agreed because they all believed that they knew the unique and definitive version of any event however insignificant during the recordings i saw that things are never absolute they depend on each individuals perceptions and the best way to know who we are is often to find out how others see us this does not mean that we should do what others expect us to do but it helps us to understand ourselves better
5258287 he needed his work not because of the money but out of a need to feel useful to prove that an exile also honours his commitments
5258288 when we step out of our normal world and leave behind us all the usual barriers and prejudices we tend to become more adventurous
5258289 in nightclubs or at parties in friends houses sensuality was definitely part of how i felt when i danced i would start by flirting and enjoying the desire in mens eyes but as the night wore on i seemed to get more in touch with myself and it was no longer important to me whether i was or wasnt seducing someone
5258290 try to feel good about yourself even when you feel like the least worthy of creatures
5258291 im not going to do the washing up let the men do i
5258292 and what greater merit shall there be than that which lies in the courage and the confidence nay the charity of receiving you give but little when you give of your possessions anyone who has decided that they cannot behave any differently will be destroyed by routine anyone who has decided to block all changes will be transformed into dust

5258297 at the time during the depression it was tough and my father was working for a company in waterbury and he was only working a couple days a week
5258298 so we needed food on the table there were seven of us besides mother and father nine people ate a lot of food
5258299 they need it today it would be wonderful today if they had it and got the kids off the street and into a camp like that work hard and earn money and learn what life is all about
5258300 shines a harsh and frankly unflattering light on the attitudes we canadians have concerning mental health
5258301 people are afraid of what they dont know it just shows that we have to make a lot more effort to educate the public about mental illness
5258302 all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me go therefore and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit teaching them to observe all that i have commanded you and lo i am with you always to the end of the age

5258318 pakistan is a vital friend of the uk and it is essential that it has a strong and democratic government with a clear mandate and programme for thoroughgoing reform of its social political and economic structures
5258319 but reform depends above all on legitimacy and that is why the uk has been at pains to stress the importance for pakistan of strong institutions rather than strong individuals and why we believe a
5258320 the responsibilities on political leaders in pakistan are now significant they need to come together to ensure that the recently elected government carries forward an economic and security agenda consistent with the long term interests of the pakistani people
5258321 and we will be clear about the essential nature of a new partnership between pakistan and

5258323 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
5258324 moderation in temper is always a virtue but moderation in principle is always a vice
5258325 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
5258326 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
5258327 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
5258328 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
5258329 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
5258330 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
5258331 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
5258332 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
5258333 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
5258334 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
5258335 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
5258336 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing

5258356 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
5258357 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit

5258411 it is only when the condition becomes really bad that repair work is carried out water logging can be seen everywhere after these rains most of the city roads have become unfit for commuting
5258412 we should have a separate crew which can undertake immediate repair work of roads after the rain spell is over to some extent the quality of bitumen is also responsible but the major problem is that we do not respond instantly
5258413 though there might be some potholes but it happens every rainy season we had allocated rs 100 crore for the maintenance of the roads the work is being carried out as soon as rains slow down we will expedite the repair work the problem is not very serious by september we will repair all the city roads
5258414 repair work is being carried out on a war footing we have a separate maintenance allocation wear and tear is normal during the monsoon within next few days we will complete the repair work

5258457 it will make it such a heightened experience for the audience and for us to cast a real life soldier a veteran and bring him into our created drama
5258458 its a very delicate subject to begin with theres so much about the individual person thats going to help us create the character and whatever they bring and whatever their challenge is will be fit into the story
5258459 the audience embraces it because they relate to the people involved who they care about
5258460 theyre great at drama but there are many nuances that can be left out without getting the reality from the troops themselves
5258461 lots of bombs they are throwing lots of bombs bombing gori and around gori the villages its a very bad situation lots of people are killed and died soldiers im very sad you know when i am thinking about soldiers i always want to cry

5258464 abu mazen pa chairman mahmoud abbas stands today and stood in the past at the head of a terrorist organization
5258465 what is the gesture for what do we receive in return if abu mazen wants to do anything that practically contradicts the hamas position he wont remain alive the time is not ripe for peace with the palestinians
5258466 we must consider the matter after the summer break the budget is the central matter as far as we are concerned and as for releasing terrorists i understand it as if we must once in a while bribe the underworld that is what the release of terrorists is if we dont want abu mazen to start a new intifada then we must pay him off
5258467 if the additional funds are not included we will not be able to support the budget in december
5258468 it appears most likely that we are headed for elections
5258469 our vision is that the jews in israel will respect the land of israel
5258470 to respect the land is to treat it as a precious resource that you know you dont have much of
5258471 people have this mentality of i dont want to be a sucker
5258472 if we talk about cleanliness if we talk about litter prevention then it will happen
5258473 the community actually feels the change happening and it creates a ripple effect of change throughout the community

5258480 the shadow of the disengagement hovered over us for at least a year
5258481 it was in the newspapers and all the media netzarim was a very special place and all the things that were special in netzarim became more intense in the last year it was really a paradise for children and a wonderful community in every aspect
5258482 basically we continued to live our lives hoping it wont happen faith emunah has an effect on reality and with that faith we are continuing
5258483 the actual part when the woman soldier took me out of the home and she cried and i cried and we kissed the ground the children and i and we said that we know that abraham was here and isaac was here we know that this was promised to us and we know that we will return i believe that when we return we will return with the backing of the entire nation
5258484 the entire nation will realize that we came back to israel to be a light upon the nations and to fulfill all of the prophecies that we grew up upon
5258485 the entire nation of israel has to come back to themselves back to their traditions and back to their land
5258486 a violation of secrecy regarding ones private matters that was determined in a clear or implied agreement
5258487 i did not find any who were involved in the actual decision making process who have expressed regret and say openly that they made a mistake
5258488 nor have there been too many who said they wouldnt do it again
5258489 i found about five who said this but they were not involved in the decision making process
5258490 i was in favor of the disengagement hoping it would bring peace with the palestinians but i was wrong
5258491 and that weakness brought about attacks in gaza and the north it did not contribute to security or to peace it did not prove itself in very many regards though it did give us much maneuverability with regard to the global sphere
5258492 i admit and i confess that i was among those who strongly supported former pm ariel sharon and the disengagement today i say with my head held high we erred we made a very big mistake withdrawals can only work when the areas are handed over to responsible hands and rooted in agreements and international guarantees here we have a precedent a territory we left turns into a base for terror period
5258493 at the time i thought differently but there is now no doubt that the disengagement was an error it has resulted in the formation of a hamastan state in gaza in addition there is an entire population that is still without homes and with unsolved problems many thousands of people i believe that we should admit openly the disengagement was a mistake
5258494 unilateral withdrawal from the west bank would not be a wise step for israel to take when one sees what happened in gaza and sees the political advantage that hamas has taken of the situation to claim unilateral victory and now to be part of the pa government how many failures do you need before you recognize that its a failure
5258495 we were the unlikeliest lot and that is precisely why god has chosen us
5258496 to make decisions in the long term interests of the country you have to take quite tough decisions quite early on so that you can get things done within the life of a parliament

5258534 over the past three years weve spent everything that weve had as everybody does
5258535 we try to do the best we can and we have a great model but were not wallowing in a lot of cash i assure you of that
5258536 weve sold 14 000 season tickets and im delighted about that but it pales in significance compared to last season
5258537 now the one thing that i think is very important is for us to have some humility
5258538 a lot of evil has been perpetrated based on the claim that we were trying to confront evil
5258539 just because we think our intentions are good doesnt always mean that were going to be doing good

5258544 phrase that has chapped our collective feminist hide for so long has disappeared from the section regarding abortion

5258546 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5258547 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5258548 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5258549 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5258550 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5258551 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5258552 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5258553 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5258554 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5258555 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5258556 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5258557 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5258558 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5258559 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5258560 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5258561 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5258562 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5258563 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5258564 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

5258567 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5258568 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5258569 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5258570 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5258571 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5258572 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

5258598 es zeigt sich immer mehr dass die vp alle f r die menschen wichtigen beschl sse auf nach der wahl verschieben will

5258602 gezielte schwerpunktaktionen gegen die zunahme von vandalismus gesch ftseinbr chen und jugendkriminalit t in der landeshauptstadt st p lten
5258603 nieder sterreichs landeshauptstadt st p lten bekommt die massiv gestiegene kriminalit t besonders zu sp ren die bev lkerung ist beunruhigt ber die steigende kriminalit t die sch den aufgrund von einbr chen diebst hlen oder vandalismus steigen jeden tag verzeichnet die landeshauptstadt durchschnittlich drei einbr che spektakul re f lle wie jener ende juli wo t ter aus einem elektrogro markt gleich 250 handys im wert von rund 100 000 euro mitgehen lie en verst rkten auch die sorgen in der wirtschaft in st p lten gab es im juli 2008 einen anstieg der kriminalit t um 5 2 prozent gegen ber dem vergleichsmonat des vorjahres da m ssen die alarmglocken schrillen
5258604 die sp fordert seit langem eine schwerpunktgruppe gegen vandalismus welche verst rkte pr senz mit fahrrad oder pkw streifen im ganzen stadtgebiet zeigt ebenso muss es in den nachtstunden zu vermehrten streifenfahrten kommen die polizei muss pr sent sein und auch zus tzliche kontrollen verd chtiger fahrzeuge m ssen m glich sein das ist nur mit mehr personal zu schaffen die stadt st p lten braucht zumindest um 50 beamtinnen mehr in gleicher zahl muss der personalstand der dienststellen des landbezirks aufgestockt werden allein in der landeshauptstadt wurden ja der in den letzten jahren durch die vp innenminister nicht nur 45 polizeiplanstellen abgebaut auch der personalstand der kriminalpolizei wurde dezimiert die negativen auswirkungen sieht man jetzt
5258605 noch sind hochsommerliche temperaturen an der tagesordnung doch der n chste winter kommt bestimmt und immer mehr menschen drohen im kommenden winter zu frieren sie k nnen sich angesichts der massiv gestiegenen energiepreise ein heizen ihrer wohnung kaum oder gar nicht mehr leisten der j ngste bericht der sterreichischen armutskonferenz malt ein dramatisches bild denn auch alle m glichkeiten ihren energieverbrauch zu senken bleiben immer mehr menschen verwehrt sie k nnen sich keine neue heizung leisten auch neue fenster oder eine verbesserung der w rmed mmung sind f r viele einfach nicht leistbar
5258606 der heizkostenzuschuss soll um 100 euro von derzeit 200 auf 300 euro pro heizperiode erh ht werden
5258607 was n tzen die besten f rderungen wenn das geld f r die anschaffung einer neuen heizanlage einfach nicht aufgebracht werden kann was n tzen die besten kreditkonditionen wenn im haushaltsbudget einfach keine r ckzahlungsrate mehr untergebracht werden kann die f rderungen m ssen ausgeweitet zusch sse erh ht werden ebenso soll wie die spn fordert f r die n landesb rgerinnen sozial gestaffelt ein strom gasbonus in der h he von bis zu 250 euro pro jahr eingef hrt werden in nieder sterreich sollte wirklich niemand frieren
5258608 wenn vp nationalratsabgeodneter ferry maier versucht wien und seinen sozialen wohnbau schlecht zu reden zeigt das von erstaunlich wenig kenntnis der materie ein bisschen mehr recherche und maier w re zumindest auf die umfassende ifes studie gesto en die wohnbaustadtrat michael ludwig vergangenen september zur zufriedenheit und lebensqualit t in den wiener gemeindebauten pr sentiert hat die ergebnisse der studie belegen ganz klar dass die wienerinnen und wiener ihre wohnhausanlagen sch tzen und gerne dort wohnen 72 prozent der bewohnerinnen und bewohner w rden wenn sie die wahl haben wieder in denselben gemeindebau einziehen
5258609 schlie lich gehen diese kampagnen der christlichsozialen bereits auf den beginn des wohnbauprogramms in den 1920 er jahren zur ck
5258610 gebracht hat es der vp bis dato nichts die wienerinnen wohnen gerne in ihren gemeindebauten heute so wie damals
5258611 luft licht und sonne war das motto dieser wohnbaut tigkeit qualitativ hochstehende architektur f r die arbeiterinnen von wien das war unsere zielsetzung und sie ist es noch heute ginge es nach den christlichsozialen w rden die meisten wienerinnen heute noch in finsteren mietskasernen wohnen
5258612 gerade vp und fp die sich in diesem wahlkampf anscheinend bevorzugt wiens gemeindebauten vorgekn pft haben zweifellos weil sie f lschlicherweise denken so den spitzenkandidaten der sp anpatzen zu k nnen sollten dabei ganz still sein
5258613 schlie lich war es die schwarz blaue bundesregierung die die hausbesorgerinnen abgeschafft hat und damit den gemeindebau bewohnerinnen gezeigt hat was sie ihnen wert sind nur unseren wohnbaustadtr ten werner faymann und seinem nachfolger michael ludwig ist es durch zahlreiche aktivit ten und initiativen zu verdanken dass sich die wienerinnen in den gemeindebauten nach wie vor wohl und sicher f hlen

5258615 essa interpreta o n s sabemos que existiu e sabemos tamb m que h pessoas que tentaram inviabilizar a ucm alegando tais motivos e outros
5258616 isso n o corresponde a verdade porque nos seus in cios na projec o na organiza o e no in cio das suas actividades a ucm destinou se servir todo o pa s
5258617 o que aconteceu foi que a uem estava mais ou menos circunscrita ao sul e ainda me lembro que o ent o ministro da educa o arnaldonhavoto falando aos bispos cerca do projecto da ucm de facto ele salientou isso dizendo que a uem est mais para os alunos da zona sul porque tem mais possibilidades de hospedagem ao passo que das outras partes do pa s est dif cil porque n o tem alojamento em maputo
5258618 portanto esses alunos est o preparados para iniciarem a faculdade de filosofia e a fuculdade de teologia isso que est reservado para a cidade de maputo

5258620 previous discussions about the niger delta crisis have been done without any input from reputable religious leaders women representatives and the militants themselves and unfortunately the outcome of those meetings has not yielded any solution thereby breeding distrust between the politicians and the people in question
5258621 most of the boys have been coming to us telling us their feelings and distrust for the politicians and those leaders who feed fat on the crisis this is an issue that involves lives destiny and generations i think religious leaders are in a better position to bridge the gap of the existing distrust between the militants and the politicians

5258645 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5258646 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5258647 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5258648 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5258649 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5258650 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5258651 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5258652 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5258653 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5258654 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5258655 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5258656 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5258657 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5258658 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5258659 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5258660 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5258661 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5258662 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5258663 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5258664 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5258665 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5258666 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5258667 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5258668 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5258669 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5258670 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5258671 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5258672 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5258673 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5258674 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

5258692 forensic analysis by computer experts established that the defendant had 241 000 indecent photographs of children being one of the largest seizures of indecent photographs in the uk
5258693 the defendants role was to police the website which gave him the opportunity to transfer these images to his computer
5258694 the evidence recovered from his computer showed he had amassed a vast collection of indecent photographs of children

5258700 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5258701 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5258702 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5258703 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5258704 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

5258710 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

5258714 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5258715 households are still keen to unlock money tied up in their house into a more spendable form
5258716 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5258717 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5258718 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5258719 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5258720 why didnt i take the opportunity to get to know this person earlier
5258721 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5258722 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5258723 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5258724 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5258725 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5258726 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5258727 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5258728 who are open to doing something on the production side
5258729 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5258730 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5258731 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5258732 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5258733 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5258734 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5258735 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5258736 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5258737 se or t has dicho que habitar as en la oscuridad de una nube y yo te he construido un excelso templo un lugar donde habites para siempre
5258738 bendito sea el se or dios de israel que con su mano ha cumplido ahora lo que con su boca le hab a prometido a mi padre david cuando le dijo desde el d a en que saqu de la tierra de egipto a mi pueblo no eleg a ninguna ciudad de las tribus de israel para que en ella se me construyera un templo donde yo habitara ni eleg a nadie para que gobernara a mi pueblo israel
5258739 pues bien mi padre david tuvo mucho inter s en construir un templo en honor del se or dios de israel pero el se or le dijo me agrada que te hayas interesado en construir un templo en mi honor
5258740 ahora el se or ha cumplido su promesa tal como lo prometi he sucedido a mi padre david en el trono de israel y he construido el templo en honor del se or dios de israel all he colocado el arca en la cual est el pacto que el se or hizo con los israelitas
5258741 se or dios de israel no hay dios como t en el cielo ni en la tierra pues t cumples tu pacto de amor con quienes te sirven y te siguen de todo coraz n
5258742 y ahora se or dios de israel cumple tambi n la promesa que le hiciste a tu siervo mi padre david cuando le dijiste si tus hijos observan una buena conducta viviendo de acuerdo con mi ley como t lo has hecho nunca te faltar un descendiente que ocupe el trono de israel en mi presencia
5258743 pero ser posible que t dios m o habites en la tierra con la humanidad
5258744 si alguien peca contra su pr jimo y se le exige venir a este templo para jurar delante de tu altar yelo t desde el cielo y juzga a tus siervos
5258745 si tu pueblo israel es derrotado por el enemigo por haber pecado contra ti y luego se vuelve a ti para honrar tu nombre y ora y te suplica en este templo yelo t desde el cielo y perdona su pecado y hazlo regresar a la tierra que les diste a ellos y a sus antepasados
5258746 cuando tu pueblo peque contra ti y t lo aflijas cerrando el cielo para que no llueva si luego ellos oran en este lugar y honran tu nombre y se arrepienten de su pecado yelos t desde el cielo y perdona el pecado de tus siervos de tu pueblo israel
5258747 cuando en el pa s haya hambre peste sequ a o plagas de langostas o saltamontes en los sembrados o cuando el enemigo sitie alguna de nuestras ciudades en fin cuando venga cualquier calamidad o enfermedad si luego en su dolor cada israelita consciente de su culpa extiende sus manos hacia este templo y ora y te suplica yelo t desde el cielo donde habitas y perd nalo
5258748 trata de igual manera al extranjero que no pertenece a tu pueblo israel pero que atra do por tu gran fama y por tus despliegues de fuerza y poder ha venido de lejanas tierras
5258749 cuando saques a tu pueblo para combatir a sus enemigos sea donde sea si el pueblo ora a ti y dirige la mirada hacia esta ciudad que has escogido hacia el templo que he construido en tu honor oye t desde el cielo su oraci n y su s plica y defiende su causa
5258750 ya que no hay ser humano que no peque si tu pueblo peca contra ti y t te enojas con ellos y los entregas al enemigo para que se los lleven cautivos a otro pa s lejano o cercano si en el destierro en el pa s de los vencedores se arrepienten y se vuelven a ti y oran a ti diciendo somos culpables hemos pecado hemos hecho lo malo y en la tierra de sus captores se vuelven a ti de todo coraz n y con toda el alma y oran y dirigen la mirada hacia la tierra que les diste a sus antepasados hacia la ciudad que has escogido y hacia el templo que he construido en tu honor oye t sus oraciones y s plicas desde el cielo donde habitas y defiende su causa
5258751 ahora dios m o te ruego que tus ojos se mantengan abiertos y atentos tus o dos a las oraciones que se eleven en este lugar
5258752 lev ntate se or y dios ven a descansar t y tu arca poderosa se or y dios que tus sacerdotes se revistan de salvaci n que tus fieles se regocijen en tu bondad se or y dios no le des la espalda a tu ungido recuerda tu fiel amor hacia david tu siervo
5258753 el se or es bueno su gran amor perdura para siempre
5258754 he escuchado tu oraci n y he escogido este templo para que en l se me ofrezcan sacrificios
5258755 en cuanto a ti si me sigues como lo hizo tu padre david y me obedeces en todo lo que yo te ordene y cumples mis decretos y leyes yo afirmar tu trono real como pact con tu padre david cuando le dije nunca te faltar un descendiente en el trono de israel
5258756 pero si ustedes me abandonan y desobedecen los decretos y mandamientos que les he dado y se apartan de m para servir y adorar a otros dioses los desarraigar de la tierra que les he dado y repudiar este templo que he consagrado en mi honor
5258757 veinte a os tard el rey salom n en construir el templo del se or y su propio palacio
5258758 mi esposa no debe vivir en el palacio de david rey de israel porque los lugares donde ha estado el arca del se or son sagrados
5258759 el que ha de venir vendr y no tardar pero mi justo vivir por la fe y si se vuelve atr s no ser de mi agrado
5258760 por tu causa nos vemos amenazados de muerte todo el d a nos tratan como a ovejas destinadas al matadero
5258761 todo lo que escuch en mi pa s acerca de tus triunfos y de tu sabidur a es cierto no pod a creer nada de eso hasta que vine y lo vi con mis propios ojos pero en realidad no me hab an contado ni siquiera la mitad de tu extraordinaria sabidur a t superas todo lo que hab a o do decir de ti dichosos tus s bditos dichosos estos servidores tuyos que constantemente est n en tu presencia bebiendo de tu sabidur a y alabado sea el se or tu dios que se ha deleitado en ti y te ha puesto en su trono para que lo representes como rey en su amor por israel tu dios te ha hecho rey de ellos para que gobiernes con justicia y rectitud pues l quiere consolidar a su pueblo para siempre
5258762 si mi padre les impuso un yugo pesado yo les aumentar la carga si l los castigaba a ustedes con una vara yo lo har con un l tigo
5258763 pueblo de israel todos a sus casas y t david oc pate de los tuyos qu parte tenemos con david qu herencia tenemos con el hijo de isa
5258764 diles a robo n hijo de salom n rey de jud y a todos los israelitas que est n en jud y en benjam n que as dice el se or no vayan a luchar contra sus hermanos
5258765 y ellos obedecieron las palabras del se or y desistieron de marchar contra jerobo n
5258766 el que ha de venir vendr y no tardar pero mi justo vivir por la fe y si se vuelve atr s no ser de mi agrado
5258767 por tu causa nos vemos amenazados de muerte todo el d a nos tratan como a ovejas destinadas al matadero
5258768 sin embargo el se or dios de israel me escogi de entre mi familia para ponerme por rey de israel para siempre
5258769 en presencia de dios que nos escucha y de todo israel que es la congregaci n del se or hoy les encarezco que obedezcan cumplidamente todos los mandamientos del se or su dios
5258770 y t salom n hijo m o reconoce al dios de tu padre y s rvele de todo coraz n y con buena disposici n pues el se or escudri a todo coraz n y discierne todo pensamiento si lo buscas te permitir que lo encuentres si lo abandonas te rechazar para siempre ten presente que el se or te ha escogido para que le edifiques un templo como santuario suyo as que an mate y pon manos a la obra
5258771 todo esto dijo david ha sido escrito por revelaci n del se or para darme a conocer el dise o de las obras
5258772 s fuerte y valiente y pon manos a la obra no tengas miedo ni te desanimes porque dios el se or mi dios estar contigo no te dejar ni te abandonar hasta que hayas terminado toda la obra del templo aqu tienes la organizaci n de los sacerdotes y de los levitas para el servicio del templo de dios adem s contar s con la ayuda voluntaria de expertos en toda clase de trabajos los jefes y todo el pueblo estar n a tu disposici n
5258773 el se or no ve el dios de jacob no se da cuenta
5258774 el que ha de venir vendr y no tardar pero mi justo vivir por la fe y si se vuelve atr s no ser de mi agrado

5258776 educated labor force fueled by its proximity to washington d c and top colleges like the university of virginia and william and mary
5258777 the quality of the education they provide and how much their students achieve
5258778 were not really too focused on that we werent paying any attention to that we were focusing on how we felt we went out there and did everything we could
5258779 we normally try not to focus on the scores its more if we did our best and today i felt like we did our best so
5258780 i was off in washington with my husband at the end of july having a romantic weekend and i picked up the post and read this op ed
5258781 his assertion was that apes are irrational and amoral those are interesting terms to apply to an animal
5258782 but those words are not at all descriptive of the apes i know
5258783 i have seen apes mediate fights and work together to punish a transgressor
5258784 el se or es bueno su gran amor perdura para siempre
5258785 el que ha de venir vendr y no tardar pero mi justo vivir por la fe y si se vuelve atr s no ser de mi agrado
5258786 por tu causa nos vemos amenazados de muerte todo el d a nos tratan como a ovejas destinadas al matadero
5258787 id say id be paying about 58 bucks for a medal at the moment im going pretty average
5258788 you dont have to know what sports about to be able to see that so its going to be difficult
5258789 ive just got to keep fighting ive been struggling for a few years and i havent given up so im not going to give up just yet
5258790 it just felt like every other race ive raced for the last year and a half
5258791 i shouldnt complain really but im here to paddle fast and im struggling to do that
5258792 im through to the semifinals so it keeps me in the game hopefully if im very very lucky ill find some energy
5258793 ive just been struggling to find energy when i race
5258794 i didnt have a back end of a race so when i wanted to lift i wasnt there it just felt heavy and tired i didnt feel strong at all
5258795 i didnt come to try and break records in that respect but to walk away with two medals so far im absolutely ecstatic eh
5258796 not in our performance more the fact that the way the competition runs with fastest teams against slowest youre going to catch people and its unfair some teams catch in the wrong place on the track and it slows you down
5258797 we were one of those unlucky teams last night we rode 57s for the second and third kilometre and then 59 for the last k
5258798 thats two seconds that we lost and we easily could have been in the final
5258799 those guys are so young they dont even realise what theyre doing right now its quite phenomenal to be riding 3 57 and one of the guys is 20
5258800 i just made a pact to myself id give everything 100 percent so when i came here id have no regrets and i dont have any
5258801 i went out and raced the best that i could and the result doesnt really reflect the race that i rode thats the way points races work though
5258802 it didnt quite work but i went out there and gave it heaps
5258803 shes just unbelievable when she wants to go she can just go
5258804 i didnt see her hardly at all the whole race then she just picks the time i saw her go and wanted to go but id just been
5258805 data store grew by more than a dozen articles this searchable resource is one of the best resources for postharvest information the following new articles were added
5258806 it is a quiet start to the week for the markets in terms of economic data and indeed for the week as a whole things could be relatively patchy which should mean little prospect of a re think in terms of the interest rate outlook in developed markets
5258807 currency players are still factoring in how bad the european economy will be
5258808 demand for raw materials in the emerging market economies has remained strong
5258809 in particular china remains a key driver of global commodity consumption through its position as a net importer of raw materials
5258810 toss the bums out were starting from scratch were starting over
5258811 these are the knuckleheads who have been in charge throw em out but american politics arent that simple
5258812 leader that god has blessed us with at this time
5258813 not only do you have a candidate who doesnt take any guff not only do you have a candidate who will hit back swiftly and forcefully and truthfully
5258814 but youve also got american people who are rising up all over the country and saying enough is enough
5258815 acest lucru reuseste sa compenseze cererea mare de pe piata dar estimam ca in scurta vreme numarul spatiilor scoase la inchiriat va atinge plafonul maxim in aceste conditii si pe baza datelor anterioare putem aprecia ca tendinta crescatoare a chiriilor se va pastra in septembrie ne asteptam la o crestere a preturilor datorata cererii foarte mari create de inceperea anului universitar dupa cele doua luni de varf traditionale septembrie si octombrie va urma o scadere moderata dar preturile se vor stabiliza la un nivel superior celui actual
5258816 we threw his punk ass out into the street aft
5258817 its nothing i can control and honestly i can say it has been very fair to me and i got the biggest gold medal of them all
5258818 im a little sad but at the same time its great to have four olympic medals
5258819 i am sure that there will be some calmness in the whole turmoil in the next six to nine months
5258820 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5258821 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5258822 however seeking advice and getting a personalised illustration before committing to an equity release product is absolutely essential so its quite concerning to see from the research that so many people dont know where to go for guidance
5258823 i really dont know that there are that many people with set hours monday through friday
5258824 but this year im forcing the kids to reuse their backpacks
5258825 they each cost 50 they like the special cool ones and theyre still holding up
5258826 ive got two teenage boys and they like the brand names
5258827 they shant expect that this year were a cheap bunch here at this house anyway
5258828 i think if parents are going to drive their kids to school and not use bus service thats already available that creates problems
5258829 those choices have to be revisited just like everywhere else
5258830 youre not supposed to say hello youre supposed to say

5258856 it was a surprise to discover that livermore nuclear weapons lab has not only secretly conducted extensive global monitoring of ionizing radiation for decades but local ionizing radiation monitoring as well
5258857 a global diabetes epidemic beginning in 1945 with the bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki has had a major contribution from the effects of uranium pollution from atmospheric testing nuclear power plants and depleted uranium weaponry introduced to the battlefield in 1991 uranium is particularly damaging to the pancreas insulin production information flow and cell function and diabetes in pregnant women has a serious effect on the foetus pancreatic cancer mortality in japanese males increased 12 fold between 1945 and 1965 during the peak of atmospheric testing
5258858 when the results of mud samples from the marin county bay side shoreline and the pacific coastline are analyzed and reported low level ionizing radiation from the sierras will be identified as the cause of what may be the highest breast cancer incidence in the united states high rates of autism also occur in areas between the sierras and marin county in low energy slow water environments where swampy still water and mudflats occur and are recharged with contaminated water washing down from the sierras the california department of developmental services dds found a 273 percent increase in autism cases between 1987 and 1998 this is due not only to residual ionizing radiation washing out of the sierras but also to the nuclear power industry in california
5258859 d uring a breast cancer conference on january 21 2006 by the bay area breast cancer and environmental research center babcerc university of california scientist dr
5258860 radiation is the only known cause of breast cancer in mic e
5258861 radiation is the only known cause of breast cancer in mice and that is why i use it to cause breast cancer in mice
5258862 breast cancer is the number two killer of navajo women after heart disease uterine and ovarian cancers doubled or tripled since 1970 in new mexico indians with no change in whites and hispanics
5258863 t he conclusion that uranium is an endocrine disrupting chemical and populations exposed to environmental uranium should be followed for increased risk of fertility problems and reproductive cancers
5258864 since 1945 the university of california and the u s nuclear weapons labs together with other nuclear states have blanketed planet earth and the global atmosphere with accumulating uranium and fission products with an unknown biological outcome this is very significant because low level uranium contamination even below epa drinking water standards is an estrogen or hormone disruptor at a minimum which means it will have a global affect and not just on females of many species raymond whist has identified some of the effects in one biological system reproductive which is a part of a larger cooperating set of systems in a human or animal super system her research predicts that infertility will increase in each future generation because of chronic low level ionizing radiation exposure cancers of reproductive organs in females will increase and the viability of future generations will decline the link between diabetes and uranium exposure is also significant to the reproductive system since pregnant women who have diabetes and little or no health care produce unhealthy babies the impact of uranium on the pancreas and production and function of insulin another hormone is very significant damage to another system
5258865 we remain bitterly disappointed at the manner in which sonny bill deserted his team mates and his supporters
5258866 we have however reached the point where we need to get on with business and we have withdrawn the injunction against him playing for any other club
5258867 neither the bulldogs nor sonny bill have anything further to gain by drawing this situation out any further
5258868 i cant speculate on what mr glenn took from that conversation but i did not believe i in any way indicated anything other than payment of tauranga electoral petition fees
5258869 aligned the fact he was paying for the tauranga electoral petition with the political party whose leader ran it
5258870 the position is i have not rendered a fee note to the solicitor for the work done and that solicitor has not rendered a bill to winston until my instructing solicitor renders a bill to winston there is no debt owed by winston
5258871 we have always operated under an agreed system of mr henry not disclosing the source of fund raising and myself not asking there is no debt to be paid or discharged
5258872 when you were saying this is a donation to you you were accepting that there was a donation to you personally
5258873 no it was a donation to the legal cost of a petition
5258874 im young nobody expects me to vote anyway other young people arent voting why bother
5258875 would you be up for donating a signed copy of your book to give to my blog friends
5258876 they do one of two things if they want to go away and feel sorry for themselves then theyre no good to me but if they prepared to come in monday roll their sleeves up and get some hard work done then thats the type we need
5258877 were here to make sure the players are out on that pitch and representative of what i would expect
5258878 if you want to feel sorry for yourself then youre no good here at burnley football club you take your medicine and the kick in the teeth which it undoubtedly is
5258879 we came here to win the game and weve not done that
5258880 of course were hurt by it and well get the necessary stick for it but that happens in football
5258881 well come back stronger for it but that means hard work and if it means trying to wheel and deal and try to get one or two in to strengthen us in that department in terms of conceding soft goals thats what well look to do
5258882 well come in on monday morning i dont want anyone moping about i want them to come in knowing theyve had a horrible weekend but ready to come into work and ready to go
5258883 we shot ourselves in the foot again you dont need to be einstein to see it
5258884 we have to be defending better and i dont just mean the back lot the first goal we lost was from a corner
5258885 people are delegated to be in certain areas to make a challenge and we never did that it deflected again and every little bit of luck is certainly bad luck going our way
5258886 i think its hit graham alexanders sin and deflected by brian jensen
5258887 whether the boys felt sorry for themselves was equally as poor even though it was an own goal no matter who put it in it just seemed to trundle into the corner
5258888 you dont feel for anybody because the bottom line is its happened
5258889 im so happy for the boss because he got some criticism that was so out of line
5258890 this first one is for him all the lads are buzzing for him
5258891 we had a lot of doubters and a lot of people saying not so nice stuff about us during the whole of pre season
5258892 but we know what has been written is so untrue
5258893 it was a load of rubbish people making stuff up about us i dont know where they get it from
5258894 i hope this has proved a lot of people wrong and that we are trying to contend right up there
5258895 every year that ive been here people have said that blackburn are just a mid table team and every year we prove them wrong hopefully we can do that again
5258896 you could ask anybody that has been at rovers and has left you cant match the spirit and team camaraderie that we have here
5258897 not many teams come to everton and get anything away from here because they are a physically imposing team but over 90 minutes we were the stronger team
5258898 everybody played well and we expected it from the first game
5258899 we have our standards and everybody saw that out there
5258900 it was no surprise to tell you the truth to see roque score
5258901 hes a quality player it was a beautiful run by him and a beautiful finish
5258902 i dont know why roque would want to leave the club hes not going to go to a better team
5258903 but he never left them without evidence of himself and his goodness for instance he sends you rain and good crops and gives you food and joyful hearts
5258904 a te k hai reso la mia vita bella da morire
5258905 desde los comienzos de la humanidad la generaci n de riqueza estuvo ligada a que alguien ten a algo m s que otro ahora por primera vez un hombre es el m s rico del mundo por su conocimiento y formaci n como es el caso de bill gates ya no hace falta desapoderar a alguien ni econ mica ni militarmente para enriquecerse
5258906 por primera vez un hombre es el m s rico del mundo por su conocimiento y formaci n como es el caso de bill gates
5258907 ya no hace falta desapoderar a alguien ni econ mica ni militarmente para enriquecerse
5258908 parents or guardians can readily look at schoolwork from a home computer or community access point and become more closely involved in the pupils development
5258909 all very well making grand speeches but where do we start
5258910 i cant remember the last time i bought a card from a store
5258911 reggae music played in the background during a three minute delay while judges looked at the photo finish
5258912 the whole process of mental adjustment and atonement can be summed up in one word gratitude
5258913 a soul that is always grateful lives in closer touch with god than one who never looks to him in thankful acknowledgment
5258914 gratitude draws the mind into closer touch with the source from which the blessings come
5258915 gratitude alone can keep you looking toward the infinite and prevent you from falling into the error of thinking that the supply of riches is limited
5258916 there is a law of gratitude and if you are to get the results you seek it is absolutely necessary that you should observe this law
5258917 if your gratitude is strong and constant the reaction in the formless substance will be strong and continuous the movement of the things you want will always be toward you
5258918 without gratitude you cannot keep from being dissatisfied with things as they are
5258919 a grateful mind continually expects good things and expectation becomes faith the reaction of gratitude upon ones own mind produces faith every outgoing wave of grateful thanksgiving increases faith
5258920 cultivate the habit of being grateful for every good thing that comes to you and give thanks continuously
5258921 the person who can sincerely thank god for the things which he owns only in imagination has real faith that person will get rich that person will cause the creation of whatsoever he wants
5258922 once upon a time test match special was part of a great tradition of bbc radio but they are bringing in commentators with little knowledge of the game especially of the cadences of test match cricket

5258935 the last three years have been enormously consequential for telstra and australia with the full privatisation of telstra construction of the worlds largest fastest and most advanced wireless broadband network and the transformation of telstra into the worlds first nextgeneration fully integrated telco
5258936 what ive seen from mike arrington has just been classless
5258937 you have heard about twitter maybe its something other people do mainly younger people you subscribe to the service then you can post little messages on peoples cellphones or on their instant message accounts about nothing
5258938 we are pleased to be hosting this event at st ethelburgas because it challenges us at a deep level to consider what reconciliation means in the
5258939 as a practice that has deep roots in many spiritual and faith traditions fasting is a powerful and unifying resource we can draw on in challenging both the personal and societal status quo
5258940 there is no doubt that we need a radical approach like this because although intellectually most of us know what needs to be done old patterns of living continue to dominate and green house gas emissions continue to rise
5258941 were not seeing the thousands the hundreds who streamed through in the past
5258942 i dont see the justification to spend 60 million on an area thats no longer an important crossing
5258943 the mid market segment lacks fine hospitality and what guests aspire for when you enter a 2 3 star hotel you really dont know what you will get
5258944 this segment is totally untapped we want to cater to mid upper middle level businessmen and holiday makers who are price sensitive but want the comfort
5258945 we want to offer our guests good value for money without comprising on quality facilities
5258946 it was not aug 16 bashr was arrested two days before on aug 14 from here and not from lucknow
5258947 moreover the sleuths also took away jewellery belonging to bashrs wife sabeela and about rs 10 000 kept at home
5258948 soon after the arrest as we went to meet bahrs father we realised the jewellery and money were missing
5258949 i decided to implement these recommendations in the larger interest of the well being of the government employees who are facing an acute crunch on account of the rising prices of essential commodities for which the central government was squarely responsible
5258950 the new pay commission would be brought into force with effect from dec 1 though we would implement it with retrospect from jan 2006
5258951 even though the central government had been indifferent to our repeated request for additional resources and had also flatly refused to concede our demand for a special package of rs 800 billion still we decided to mobilise our own resources to meet the additional burden that the new pay scales would entail
5258952 while the arrears were estimated at about rs 148 billion the annual burden on the state exchequer would be about rs 52 billion
5258953 india will not interfere in pakistans affairs relationship with pakistan is not individual specific
5258954 i do hope politics in pakistan will be settled soon
5258955 we have no comments to make on the resignation of president musharraf of pakistan this is an internal matter of pakistan
5258956 whether he is impeached or not is not important from the indian point of view it is for the people of pakistan to decide
5258957 but it leaves a big vacuum and we are deeply concerned about this vacuum because it leaves the radical extremist outfits with freedom to do what they like not merely on the pakistan afghan border but clearly our side of the border too
5258958 scientists at the smithsonian institution have discovered a new species of bird in gabon africa that was until now unknown to the scientific community their findings were published in the international science journal zootaxa aug 15
5258959 i suspected something when i found the first bird in gabon since it didnt exactly match any of the species descriptions in the field guides
5258960 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special you of course have to be cautious but i was still very excited at the prospect of possibly having found a new species of bird
5258961 allora immagina che durante il giorno hai bevuto troppo latte alla fragola la notte ti svegli perch devi andare in bagno ti accorgi per che fuori dalle coperte fa freddo e non ti va di uscire dal letto dopo un po hai un bisogno di urinare insopportabile agonia ansia dilemma il momento si fa impellente cos decidi di andare in bagno sei in piedi davanti alla tazza tiri fuori spari ti senti liberato per un istante pensi che si viva solo per un momento come questo ma poi ti rendi conto che non sei in bagno hai solo sognato sei ancora dentro al letto tra le gambe si allarga la sensazione di qualcosa di caldo per non puoi fermarti non ce la fai eccola qui questa la verit questo che significa essere un bevitore di latte alla fragola capito

5258966 cancer can be detected in their relatives of a normal size but never in my patients not one single case

5258987 de beelden van bombardementen in georgi kunnen perfect naast beelden van doel geplaatst worden ook hier wordt alles plat gegooid
5258988 ik ga er niet om liegen ik maak me wel degelijk zorgen want gezien er geen nieuwe boeken meer komen zullen de verwachtingen niet zo hoog gespannen zijn het zou pas echt erg zijn mocht er niemand komen opdagen
5258989 dat belgi nog geen medaille heeft kunnen behalen op deze spelen wakkert de verwachtingen naar ons toe natuurlijk nog aan
5258990 wij fixeren ons echter niet op het brons we gaan eerst en vooral voor een finale en daarin proberen we dan een belgisch record te lopen als we daarin slagen is een mooie plaats niet veraf
5258991 het heeft daarom ook niet veel zin om de andere landen te analyseren
5258992 de concurrentie is net het enige wat we niet onder controle hebben als we naar de anderen zouden kijken zou dat alles nog veel vermoeiender maken
5258993 we hebben gezien dat onze aflossingen op de laatste trainingen heel goed waren alle kleine problemen zijn onder controle en we zijn allemaal in vorm dus we zijn er helemaal klaar voor
5258994 het is zo goed als opgelost dus ik zal 200 kunnen voluit gaan
5258995 as fast as they pumped blood into him it just kept coming out
5258996 he was stabbed one two three times in the back
5258997 he didnt feel too bad at first and came inside to change and then go back to the fight but he just collapsed in blood on the floor
5258998 but things went wrong in high school he got involved with the wrong crowd
5258999 he was a good boy he was not perfect but he was not a criminal
5259000 it was a simple fight they must have trash talked each other and then one guy decided he couldnt take that

5259015 i felt at some point i would have to face the fans so i figured it might as well be now
5259016 the line is kind of everything is organized so that its kind of fly by but some people lean in and say positive things im dealing with it keep your head up it really makes me feel good that im not the only one going through it
5259017 i kind of feel like some of the fans are going through it with me those that are admitting it those that know that they have it
5259018 i was kind of pessimistic how my teammates would receive me
5259019 there were a lot of rumors i admitted to my teammates i created a lot of those rumors at the time coach andy reid didnt know the truth people were saying it was really about his contract didnt want to play football anymore and i admit that i created those rumors just out of a lot of frustration and didnt care what people thought
5259020 you have a guy whos quick tempered whos to the point where i really didnt care anymore thats not the real me i just didnt realize what i was going through
5259021 a few weeks ago was the first time ive ever opened up to anybody about anything that was part of the reason
5259022 coach reid after he realized that shawn andrews did have a serious problem he was very positive about the situation hes a funny guy he helps you laugh tries to make the situation better
5259023 i just wanted to talk to those guys face to face man to man
5259024 i just felt like whether they believed me or not i did my part in my mind i hope they believe me i think for the most part they do and i hope they respect me if they dont they will
5259025 i really cant put it into words id like their respect as a player but id like their respect as a person first life is short and there are a lot more things i can count that are more important than football
5259026 like i said i had a million and one thoughts going through my head
5259027 i just lost my love for a lot of things i didnt know which direction i was headed football wasnt even a thought
5259028 i would love to play against the patriots i mean it feels good to be back and around my teammates

5259046 all agreed that the king had certain prerogative rights such as the right to mint coin or to create peers what james and charles also claimed was an absolute prerogative right to take any action outside the law which they thought necessary for national defence or national security as defined by themselves this prerogative the house of commons and the common lawyers denied to the government but it is a right which parliament exercises today it is the ultimate right of sovereignty which in any state some authority must exercise parliament and common lawyers did not deny the existence of the royal prerogative but since it was being used to meet novel problems they rightly thought that the king and his favourites were stretching it unprecedentedly from the kings point of view his critics seemed to be acting in a merely negative and obstructive way

5259122 if you have an older grade school child they are going to need a sturdy and safe backpack
5259123 when meeting the veterans initially it was apparent that their time in the armed forces had lasting effects on them most were very open about their experiences while there were a few who were more reserved and seemed reluctant to open up
5259124 it was excellent to be able to interact with the veterans the aim of the weekend was for us to build their confidence but in fact it was them who built mine i am happy that both age groups managed to learn from each other rather than it being a one way experience
5259125 we all have shared goals and ambitions the only difference being that most of the veterans have managed to achieve theirs and i still have to fulfill mine i realised then that although the veterans are from a different generation they are not much different from the modern day cadets
5259126 his logic is that since mugabe is saying the deal currently on the table gives the prime minister a lot of powers then he must assume that position and tsvangirai becomes president
5259127 wfp does not believe his death to be related to the recent spate of targeted attacks on aid workers in somalia
5259128 i am shocked by this senseless and barbaric attack on one of our staff
5259129 our thoughts and prayers are with his family friends and colleagues
5259130 this is the first violent death of a wfp staff member in somalia since 1993 although five drivers employed by wfp contractors have been killed since the start of the year
5259131 the same old folks that brought you george w bush
5259132 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
5259133 respectfully im going to disagree with you on mccain and his service
5259134 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5259135 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5259136 john mccain has never questioned sen obamas patriotism but he clearly does question sen obamas experience and judgment and they do have profound differences of opinion on the best way to reduce our dependence on mideast oil bring jobs back to america and keep our nation safe
5259137 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5259138 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5259139 id have to say that monckton won the debate he came across as more prepared and had answers at his fingertips whereas richard appeared to verbally stumble on occasion
5259140 i got the impression that littlemore was engaging in the debate totally unprepared
5259141 oh my this is very confusing no wonder the government says its too early to take action
5259142 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5259143 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5259144 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5259145 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5259146 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5259147 the new design to run of rays can effectively avoid the contortion of image and makes the super wide angle the larger luminous flux the higher visual acuteness good for color reduction which makes the high quality of photography

5259149 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
5259150 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
5259151 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know

5259154 what the parliament has done today was constitutional the procrastination of the opposition and its failure to fulfill its promises is against the constitution
5259155 the opposition parties want us to subjugate laws and the parliament to their wishes and even want to postpone elections for another year this is unacceptable
5259156 regrettably the parliament was transformed today into a crisis creation arena instead of being a place to solve crises gpc mps have created a new crisis by their decision
5259157 this ones going to be a little complicated for the hurricane center to pin down

5259161 every four years you usually get to look at these guys try to go native think of president bush in his brush clearing outfit
5259162 but if youre president the day job does involve a suit and it can be awkward when youre not in work clothes
5259163 everyone knows how fast a picture can go from local novelty to worldwide laughingstock
5259164 it shows hes not trying to be like everyone else its part of the visual message that hes crafting in an odd little way it adds to the not pandering in a conservative middle america suit like a 50 year old tax lawyer wears
5259165 it would be inappropriate if mccain looked as stylish as obama he has a different physique hes a different age and hes much more conservative
5259166 he does have occasional fun with a wider flashy tie
5259167 not all senators can wear that but it looks right on him
5259168 you could put baracks head on johns body and say hes gained a little weight but you wouldnt notice he was in different clothes
5259169 the democrats talk of tolerance but in reality the only tolerance they ever exhibit is for their own intellectual arrogance and they dont have tolerance for my culture
5259170 they think were a bunch of hillbilly heathens who go out and burn crosses and do crazy bullshit
5259171 they dont give a f if were with them or not because it doesnt matter the f ing republicans have stolen the individual liberties thing and thats why the gun thing is such a big deal
5259172 i got a call from them right after johnny got out i never heard back
5259173 sometimes they remind me of another bunch from chicago the blues brothers they seem to think theyre on a mission from god
5259174 if thats how he runs his campaign he is going to lose id rather bet on those who voted before when he stands up and says that im gonna get 30 per cent more black voters im gonna get 30 per cent more of my people to turn out for me what is joe six pack thinking
5259175 instead of all the high falutin exhortation about listening to the better angels mr obama has gotta come out here and time is short and emphasise social justice
5259176 he should say im a black guy im not gonna take the michael jackson treatment but the problems of south side chicago are the same problems of the appalachian mountains big sonsofabitches are kicking the little sonsofabitches in the ass now im one of the little sonsofabitches so im pissed off inside every rural republican is a rural democrat begging to get out but we always trip over our johnsons
5259177 think this election will be won on the internet but here at 5 30 in the afternoon they dont go on the goddamn internet they go watch the andy griffith show a 1960s sitcom
5259178 white people in the south and throughout the appalachians love black culture i mean southern style cooking is black food everything i eat is fried your swing vote in the appalachians comes down to common sense thinking people who have strong faith and what barack obama needs to do is embrace his culture because we like his culture but nobody knows anything about him over 10 per cent of the rednecks out here and im a redneck think hes a muslim cause nobodys ever told em any different
5259179 im pretty sure i aint a queer and ive never had queer thoughts
5259180 but god loves them queers every bit that he loves the republicans

5259220 well i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5259221 but let me just speak more generally about the issue of abortion because this is something obviously the country wrestles with one thing that im absolutely convinced of is there is a moral and ethical content to this issue so i think that anybody who tries to deny the moral difficulties and gravity of the abortion issue i think is not paying attention so that would be point number one
5259222 at the moment of conception i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies

5259239 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
5259240 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5259241 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5259242 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5259243 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5259244 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5259245 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5259246 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5259247 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5259248 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5259249 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5259250 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5259251 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5259252 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5259253 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5259254 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify

5259258 this years report card shines a harsh and frankly unflattering light on the attitudes we canadians have concerning mental health
5259259 in some ways mental illness is the final frontier of socially acceptable discrimination
5259260 can you imagine the public uproar if mental health was replaced with race gender or religion
5259261 these figures show clearly the insidious stigma still associated with mental health and mental illness
5259262 these are the attitudes that have kept mental health on the outside for far too long
5259263 these findings indicate that the worrying trend of have and have not patients continues
5259264 ensuring canadians have access to a family physician is a key area for action

5259312 i had an episode with summit energy they contacted me the day after my husband died and talked to my son he told them they should talk to me because their offer sounded good they never did and i never signed anything nor did anyone else but they told terasen that i was their customer and it took endless calls and several months of higher bills and an ultimate complaint laid by me with the utilities commission before summit let me out from under what they called compassionate grounds this was without a signed contract my advice is dont even talk to these people

5259334 here as you can all see is a copy of the agreement titled memorandum of mutual undertaking on the establishment of a flag carrier between the government of the federal republic of nigeria and virgin atlantic limited virgin airways limited entered into on september 28 2004 between the federal government and the virgin atlantic limited and there is nothing in the document that says the airline will operate from the international airport terminal
5259335 but here i have another document with which virgin is basing its claim a letter written on the virgin atlantic letterhead and signed by its executive chairman sir richard branson
5259336 to this end the airline will be allowed to use the relevant international terminals in nigerian airports including murtala muhammed airport lagos and nnamdi azikiwe airport abuja for all the airlines operations including both international and domestic services subject to compliance with icaos standard and recommended practices on aviation security
5259337 unfortunately yuguda endorsed the letter but the pertinent question is should a letter written by sir branson on the virgin atlantic letterhead be binding on our country even if the minister endorsed it why was the issue not part of the memorandum of undertaking signed by all the parties
5259338 is that the way business transactions are conducted with nations that a company chief executive would after publicly signing a memorandum of undertaking with the government now write a personal letter on his companys letterhead and expect any self respecting nation to take that as a binding contract just because he got somebody to append his signature to it
5259339 it is indeed sad that a well respected global citizen like richard branson would now be orchestrating negative media propaganda against nigeria when the country has not breached any agreement with his company
5259340 there is also security issue involved in the whole debate which means that even if virgin has a valid claim which as it were it doesnt have they can still be told to leave the international wing on grounds of security
5259341 not do or permit to be done anything which would violate nigerian laws and regulations including laws and regulations relating to matters of strategic security and economic interest of the federal republic of nigeria
5259342 you now ask yourself what then is the basis of all the noise the airlines is making
5259343 one major challenge for this administration is the fact that over the years public officials hardly bothered about the interest of our people when entering into contracts and agreements on behalf of the federal government
5259344 in addition moslems and christians must be allowed to practise their religion as contained in their holy books
5259345 god has blessed nigeria with abundant human and materials resources and all we need as a people is for each and everyone of us to contribute to move the country forward
5259346 nigeria will not develop if we keep emphasising those things that divide us we should emphasis those things that unite us and not dwell on our differences
5259347 similarly those who are rich or poor do not belong to one particular religion or tribe so our problem has nothing to do with religion or tribe
5259348 we will make progress as a nation if we work together as other multi religious and ethnic societies have done to move their countries forward
5259349 we have in this country an overabundance of supply of health care services
5259350 so as we look to find ways to help stem the increase in cost associated with medical benefits we have to realize thats money coming out of revenue for a provider of care
5259351 the economic cost estimate to central new york for smoking is 763 million
5259352 individuals and society we can act on what we see in the mirror
5259353 you folks cant sustain that we cant as a community sustain that
5259354 supports privatization tax cuts and government spending cuts and opposes laws that limit spending by non party organizations during election campaigns
5259355 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry
5259356 we had predicted a growth of 9 1 per cent in our first forecast in february 2008 which was revised up to 9 5 per cent in june 2008 we now believe that the economy would grow by 9 4 per cent in fy09
5259357 we now believe that the industrial sector would grow by 11 1 per cent and not 11 4 per cent as predicted earlier
5259358 a total of 49 deaths corresponding to 1 18 per cent mortality among the enrolled patients were recorded during the studies
5259359 as our organisation is working for the welfare of children facing medical challenges we used to hear or read that several studies are being conducted on human babies in the country
5259360 i wanted to get the factual information on such trials so we can press the government to formulate some specific policy to regulate it

5259417 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5259418 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5259419 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5259420 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5259421 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5259422 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5259423 ever since barack obama first ascended the national stage at the 2004 democratic convention pundits have been tripping over themselves to point out the difference between him and the average joe from the south side
5259424 he has no past he simply appears one day to help the white protagonist
5259425 colorblind barack obama would be the great black hope in the next presidential race if he were actually black
5259426 just as the negro friendly bill clinton had to gamble on retaining that base while reassuring whites that he knew how to keep blacks in line so mr obama has to reassure blacks he is unafraid to tell whites things that whites decidedly do not want to hear he didnt attain power through traditional black channels thats partially why whites can embrace him but blacks fear that one day hell go tiger woods on us and get all race transcendent
5259427 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
5259428 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
5259429 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
5259430 people sometimes want to wear just a t shirt and a pair of jeans rather than buying the entire gucci collection
5259431 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5259432 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5259433 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5259434 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5259435 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5259436 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5259437 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5259438 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5259439 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5259440 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5259441 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5259442 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5259443 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5259444 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5259445 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5259446 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5259447 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5259448 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5259449 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5259450 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5259451 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5259452 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5259453 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5259454 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5259455 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5259456 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5259457 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5259458 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5259459 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5259460 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5259461 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5259462 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5259463 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5259464 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5259465 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5259466 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5259467 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5259468 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks

5259470 the announcement by president musharraf that he is standing down as president brings to a close a critical period in pakistans history and its relations with the uk and other countries
5259471 pakistan is a vital friend of the uk and it is essential for britains security never mind the personal ties that bind nearly one million british people to pakistan that it has a strong and democratic government with a clear mandate and programme for thoroughgoing reform of its social political and economic structures
5259472 in this context the musharraf years yielded significant dividends notably in the economic field but also until last autumn in areas like media freedom it is important to highlight president musharrafs commitment to tackle terrorism to promote dialogue with india especially over kashmir and to root out corruption
5259473 but reform depends above all on legitimacy and that is why the uk has been at pains to stress the importance for pakistan of strong institutions rather than strong individuals and why we believe a strong democracy is key
5259474 the responsibilities on political leaders in pakistan are now significant they need to come together to ensure that the recently elected government carries forward an economic and security agenda consistent with the long term interests of the pakistani people
5259475 the uk will remain strongly committed to its partnership with the pakistani people notably through our aid programme
5259476 i look forward to the early election of a new president in pakistan to take forward the important shared work that binds our two countries together

5259482 steiner has overcome great adversity since placing seventh in the 105 kilogram category in athens 2004 where he was competing for his native austria he changed his citizenship to german after a falling out with the austrian weightlifting federation
5259483 until athens i was always trying hard to lose weight to stay below 105 kg but i couldnt lose weight any more
5259484 some lifters take more in training but i need the adrenaline of the competition

5259487 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5259488 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5259489 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
5259490 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
5259491 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
5259492 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
5259493 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal

5259496 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
5259497 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
5259498 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
5259499 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
5259500 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
5259501 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
5259502 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
5259503 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
5259504 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
5259505 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
5259506 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
5259507 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
5259508 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
5259509 the united states is planning to take control of all military operations in afghanistan next year with an iraq style troop surge after becoming frustrated at natos failure to defeat the taliban
5259510 it was pretty swollen he will be out for two or three weeks
5259511 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous

5259577 the past two weekends unknown persons have thrown what appears to be a molotov cocktail against the wall of mission hill elementary school
5259578 we had our guys watching for hot spots until noon today and we had investigators on scene to determine the cause of the fire so far from evidence weve gathered the fire looks suspicious

5259593 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5259594 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5259595 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5259596 we have no confidence in these international observers in these people who corrupt the truth
5259597 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5259598 it was pointed out to the u s that u s officials public statements on the events in south ossetia need to be brought into compliance with the reality of the difficult situation in the region
5259599 russia was dragged into the military crisis as a result of the adventure by saakashvili who would not dare to start it without outside support
5259600 the same applies to the entire region there is such ethnic overlapping in literally all countries and all this talk of this is our land we are liberating our land must be dropped
5259601 one should not try to resolve the problems of the caucasus by force such attempts have been numerous and every time the result has been the same a legally binding agreement on the non use of force is needed if the west helped to reach such an agreement it would do a good job if it takes a different road of condemning russia and rearming georgia and u s officials are already speaking of that a new aggravation is inevitable and the outcome will be even worse
5259602 i wouldnt say theres a humanitarian catastrophe but theres an urgent need for primary products

5259615 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5259616 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5259617 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5259618 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5259619 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5259620 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5259621 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5259622 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5259623 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5259624 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5259625 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5259626 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5259627 ive starting using the egg trick and ive been able to lower my commuting fuel costs by more than 10 per cent
5259628 eigentlich hat die kunst sich immer sehr bem ht sich der mode zu verweigern aber heute ist sie mit ihr eine symbiose eingegangen inzwischen ist mode auch so eine art inszenierung die weit ber das dekorative hinausgeht
5259629 ja doch sie kann einen mit dem ansinnen des bleibenwollens auch bedrohen nicht wahr ich meine alles ist verg nglich au erdem ist es ja auch nicht so dass man nach einer saison alles wegwirft ich entdecke oft kleider die drei vier jahre alt sind und denke ach so etwas sch nes f llt dir heute nicht mehr ein ich geh re ja noch zu den dinosauriern der mode die alles selbst machen
5259630 ja und irritation ich finde kleider die aussehen als br uchte man anziehhilfen unerotisch designer wie alexander mcqueen foltern frauen mit korsetts und st tzstangen meine kleider sollen so aussehen als ob jemand wie brigitte bardot direkt aus dem meer kommt wie damals in cannes ich sah das als junge die brauchte nur ein schlampiges t shirt dagegen wirkten alle anderen hollywood stars auf einmal wie alte gebrauchte cadillacs
5259631 guter stil ist es souver n mit seinen fehlern umgehen zu k nnen das haben frauen wie jennifer lopez vorgemacht mit ihrem viel zu dicken arsch ich finde das nat rliche unzul ngliche viel aufreizender als das glatte

5259633 we dont have a mandate to share editorial were so local in our orientation its never made any sense to do it that way i think weve got six or seven film critics around the company now if you put your efficiency hat on could one film reviewer do the same job for everybody perhaps but that connection to film and the local community is something im proud of im more interested in trying something that really takes this talent and creates a national web site out of it

5259643 its the price of gas i think that has made people think a little bit more about improving their lifestyle and giving back to the earth
5259644 my goal is to show people how to cook local produce
5259645 it doesnt have to be transported all the way across the country or across the globe
5259646 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living

5259649 my son went to his first drama lesson and he turned to his teacher and said dont worry
5259650 i was fascinated by the psychic i wanted to know what it felt like when youre channeling or doing whatever it takes to get to that state of mind so he changed my perspective on it
5259651 i would love to be able to contact people on the other side
5259652 if i could speak to my grandmother tonight id be doing it so i do believe
5259653 theyve spent a lot of money in the horse business
5259654 potentially detrimental to ch2m hills reputation in the business community or impact our future business operations
5259655 the government will not charge allens son mark allen or other family members of allen with any criminal offense arising out of the governments investigation or that have been disclosed to the government
5259656 he put it in there that was in the plea agreement but i dont know that his kids were really in any jeopardy
5259657 he took a pretty big haircut because of all of this
5259658 whatever people think of the events of 2006 the fact is that allen built the company going from nothing to a company that was doing a billion worth of business and then he had to sell at a fire sale price because of all the trouble he got in
5259659 ich finde nicht dass brasilien eine tolle leistung geboten hat wir hatten es in der ersten halbzeit in der hand das spiel zu entscheiden

5259661 wir h tten gerne so viel transparenz wie m glich
5259662 to paraphrase maggie thatcher we also met with flaherty and the gentleman is not for turning the government isnt going to change amp judging from my e mails and work by analysts such as your former partner diane urquhardt sic theres a lot of retired folks who are not loving trusts these days
5259663 now trying to tarnish the reputations of me journalists mps economists investment advisors anyone who disagrees with you is not healthy please everyone out there lets help our pal brent
5259664 i think that the biggest thing that the communications on the governments side can bring to the table and what they try to focus on is anticipation
5259665 i didnt explore the possibility that flaherty was lying perhaps i should have
5259666 those who saw the movie told the authorities they were shocked to find that bachchan played the role of god
5259667 a pct spokesman said the systems introduction would be delayed for a few months while the pct addressed issues around consent and data security he said all personal data would be secure fifty three of the pct s 61 gp practices had signed up for the wirral keep well service four have dropped out following the negative publicity however
5259668 i believe we need to listen to patients experience and expectations to forge a new partnership with doctors nurses and other practitioners and together produce a way forward that will lead to an nhs that is changing to be truly patient led and ever more responsive to their needs
5259669 every adult in wirral is to be unwittingly signed up to a privately run telephone health advice line by the local primary care trust
5259670 virtualy all the gps on wirral have signed up to this scheme and this has followed careful debate
5259671 the opt out approach has also been agreed by the bma
5259672 it is an interesting plot and i am very happy with the way the film has been shot
5259673 i love the shopping the food and the people in dubai and would not miss any chance to come here but i was not involved in those daring stunts i play an air hostess in a red skirt so i was not the one hanging from helicopters
5259674 shiney is a good actor and has done a great job in this film i am looking forward to doing another film with him

5259677 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
5259678 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
5259679 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
5259680 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
5259681 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
5259682 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
5259683 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
5259684 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
5259685 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
5259686 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
5259687 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
5259688 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
5259689 what do we have to give up to reach the cost of a trillion and a half to three trillion dollars theres going to have to be some pain some sacrifice on the part of the american taxpayer isnt there
5259690 the real way to bring gasoline prices down is not by going back to try more of the same things that have not worked in the past but to say wait a minute now is the time for a really dramatic shift over to renewable energy
5259691 he did not force gore to debate a crackpot from cloud cuckoo land who is still waiting for the evidence to arrive about human sources of radical climate change
5259692 the unsupported assumption catastrophic global warming follows burning fossil fuels requires immediate action
5259693 the unsupported assumption that the world is more than 6000 years old
5259694 he did not force gore to debate a crackpot from cloud cuckoo land who is still waiting for the evidence to arrive about human sources of radical climate change
5259695 today for one of the first times my players played to instruction and im actually very pleased with them im glad we won and im glad were going to the semi finals this was the best game weve played so far
5259696 tactically weve been uncertain weve been continually unsure but today saturday we looked good we talked about how wed play against the ivorians and the players followed the plan
5259697 it was a very close match between two hard working sides
5259698 only one of us could go through to the semis and unfortunately for us it was nigeria hopefully we can qualify for south africa 2010 and perhaps you might see several of these players in the squad
5259699 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
5259700 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
5259701 america uses a lot of oil thats 25 percent of the worlds oil demand used by just 4 percent of the world population
5259702 the simple truth is that cheap and easy oil is gone
5259703 i think i would be for al gore for energy czar in an obama administration
5259704 pickens is out to make billions of dollars for himself and to save the sierra clubs anti coal anti oil anti natural gas agenda
5259705 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5259706 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5259707 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5259708 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5259709 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
5259710 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
5259711 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
5259712 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
5259713 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
5259714 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
5259715 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
5259716 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
5259717 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
5259718 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
5259719 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5259720 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5259721 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5259722 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5259723 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
5259724 i want to reinforce our commitment to tackling knives and getting them off our streets
5259725 i think it comes down to a few things good leadership good coaching having the right athletes
5259726 weve got a young dynamic team and we havent even started yet were only just getting going
5259727 a free taste would go a long way in making the consumer case for mobile tv
5259728 mobile tv services have taken off in japan and south korea where service is offered free of charge in italy where additional fees have been the norm usage has been limited
5259729 once you start charging consumers they start getting turned off
5259730 it was a big family we had fun we were all one anothers best friends
5259731 i dont think that they will do anything to create better behavior and think it is simply a shell game that will only end up lining someones pockets

5259739 she loves the surreal look sound and score one of her new songs heavily samples the theme tune and the soundtrack and score will be a theme running throughout the record
5259740 its really interesting if a little bizarre but i suppose thats what you would expect from her at the moment
5259741 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
5259742 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
5259743 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
5259744 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
5259745 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
5259746 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
5259747 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
5259748 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
5259749 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
5259750 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states

5259752 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
5259753 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5259754 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
5259755 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

5259759 the announcement by president musharraf that he is standing down as president brings to a close a critical period in pakistans history and its relations with the uk and other countries
5259760 pakistan is a vital friend of the uk and it is essential that it has a strong and democratic government with a clear mandate and programme for thoroughgoing reform of its social political and economic structures
5259761 but reform depends above all on legitimacy and that is why the uk has been at pains to stress the importance for pakistan of strong institutions rather than strong individuals and why we believe a strong democracy is key
5259762 the responsibilities on political leaders in pakistan are now significant they need to come together to ensure that the recently elected government carries forward an economic and security agenda consistent with the long term interests of the pakistani people
5259763 and we will be clear about the essential nature of a new partnership between pakistan and afghanistan

5259774 watching with glee someone else fall down and to be ripped to shreds
5259775 they tend to fall in love more with the way they rip the film apart much more than they hate the film
5259776 when they journalists get a certain whiff of an interesting story on someone their greatest fear would be that it will be denied by the person
5259777 it is primarily because most of the mumbai media hobnobs and rubs shoulders with the film people
5259778 the film people out of their fear and greed and in order to use the media people open their doors to them and almost become informants to the media about the rest of their colleagues in the industry
5259779 media looses its primary objective and tends to get embroiled in the camp culture of the industry

5259795 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5259796 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5259797 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5259822 karena mereka masih belum resmi ditetapkan sebagai calon gubernur dan wakil gubernur kalau sudah resmi ditetapkan dan masih ada atribut kampanye mereka yang terpasang sementara masa kampanye belum dimulai ya mereka bisa dinilai melanggar
5259823 membersihkan atribut kampanye itu harus ada tim tapi tentang itu telah kami bawa dalam rapat pleno panwaslu

5259831 joseph is a great signing for us and im sure that he will help us improve as a team once he is fully fit
5259832 when we first spoke to him it was clear that he was serious about coming here and doing well for us he has very high standards as do we and that can only be a good thing
5259833 he was very interested in what direction we were going how we planned on getting there and what we wanted to achieve going forward he liked what we had to say and we were encouraged by what he said
5259834 by bringing in a player of his skill we are showing people that we are moving forward as a club his experience will be vital for us as we have a very young squad right now
5259835 for now joseph is on loan with us we will review the situation at the end of the season
5259836 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
5259837 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
5259838 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
5259839 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
5259840 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5259841 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon

5259844 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
5259845 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

5259847 tim wore his catholicism proudly he talked about it all the time
5259848 in fact russerts faith was not an elephant in the room it was the room it was the room he was raised in it was one of his great charms as was how he dealt with it in life and in our public discourse
5259849 catholicism was his base it was never his bias i think thats absolutely crucial and i will debate anyone who contends to the contrary
5259850 learnings from the political process for common ground in the catholic church
5259851 understood that the stakes were high he knew that better than most of us
5259852 he knew that the civility of our dialogue was under attack he knew that diversity in the public square takes work every day and he knew that our standards of journalism were being attacked
5259853 he understood what it meant to be called to be catholic and i think thats very important he took the call
5259854 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
5259855 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
5259856 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11

5259858 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
5259859 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
5259860 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
5259861 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
5259862 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
5259863 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
5259864 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
5259865 the real tension exists in trying to hold the vision and helping to build the vision with others youve got to let them have their own vision but tie it all together

5259885 we do not want a deterioration of international relations we want to be respected we want our people our values to be respected

5259887 in some ways mental illness is the final frontier of socially acceptable discrimination
5259888 we call some things mental illness because it gives some people an excuse for poor behaviour and personal failings
5259889 i wish i could say i was knocked off my feet i wish i could say this came as a huge surprise and disappointment
5259890 the reality is in 21st century canada that it doesnt
5259891 if somebody said to you they had a pain in their stomach you wouldnt assume it was fake you would assume they had a problem and had to get it looked at
5259892 people arent willing to recognize that mental illness is a genuine illness
5259893 an almost religious judgment of people involved with alcohol or drugs as sinners
5259894 there are all kinds reasons why people fall prey to these problems

5259908 in the opinion of specialists the latest geopolitical and economic shocks have only increased the negative attitudes of investors
5259909 as a result of the conflict in south ossetia the mechel affair and the scandal around tnk bp we have lowered our prediction on the inflow of foreign investment from 40 to 30 billion us dollars
5259910 after the beginning of the armed conflict western creditors cut and then closed credit limits for western companies thus it is possible to expect a reduction of the inflow of credit from abroad and an increase in their cost

5259943 not only a requirement of law it is a requirement of justice to the victims and of deterrence to powerful countries such as those in nato who in their military might and in their control over the media are lacking in any other natural restraint such as might deter less powerful countries
5259944 by holding individuals accountable regardless of their position the ictys work has dismantled the tradition of impunity for war crimes and other serious violations of international law particularly by individuals who held the most senior positions
