3680021 although pelecanos pays homage to his crime writing roots uncoiling a lethal subplot involving no good charles baker that spurs a fitting if bloody resolution it is the central questions of how men can have purpose and atone for their sins that makes the turnaround an indelible read
3680022 fuller never met him bryant but re creating him has dragged her into a world of greed and power and destruction and beauty more instructive on the unsettled state of the democratic party and its current leftward drift we are witnessing a tectonic shift from the centrism that president clinton embraced and imposed on his restive followers to a more open throated liberalism now referred to as progressivism that is angry and spoiling for a fight
3680023 one thousand years after the formidable war machines of the user cultures devoured entire civilizations and rewrote planetary geography earth is in the grip of a perpetual dark age scientific endeavor is strongly discouraged while remnant technology is locked away hidden by a church determined to prevent a new armageddon this is the world to which benzamir michael mahmood must return a descendant of the tribes who fled the planet during those ages old wars he comes in pursuit of enemies from the far reaches of space the technology he brings is wondrous beyond the imaginings of those he will meet but can its potency match that of the churchs most closely guarded treasure for centuries it has lain dormant but it is about to be unearthed and the powers that will be unleashed may be beyond anyones capacity to control even a man as extraordinary as benzamir

3680028 fruit is generally expensive in japan and people often buy grapes peaches and melons as luxury gifts japanese are often willing to pay top prices for high end fruits especially for the prestige of owning the very first ones of the year
3680029 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3680030 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did

3680034 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3680035 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3680036 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3680037 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3680038 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3680039 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3680040 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

3680042 the ausvet plan is very clear on what is required to prevent any further spread of this highly fatal disease
3680043 in these cases human health and safety must come first
3680044 in the interests of protecting people and horses from further infection euthanasia is the most appropriate response
3680045 they are trying to tell us the horse is still positive
3680046 they are saying theres a 10 per cent chance it could be hidden in his system and come out at a later date
3680047 the only evidence they have for that is a different virus in india
3680048 the whole thing is they dont have any answer to this virus

3680074 die fans sind teil des klubs ihre unterst tzung ist sehr wichtig
3680075 sie feuern uns immer an egal wie das spiel l uft weil sie wissen dass es bessere und schlechtere phasen in einer partie gibt das wichtigste ist aber dass wir unser bestes geben
3680076 die vorgabe in der vorbereitung war es sofort voll einsatzf hig zu sein
3680077 wir haben uns gut vorbereitet und den gegner genau unter die lupe genommen aber das wichtigste ist wie wir selbst auftreten
3680078 ich m chte nicht dass meine spieler nur aufgrund ihres namens verlieren nat rlich k nnen wir verlieren weil wir ja hier ber fu ball reden wir treffen auf eine mannschaft die auch fehler machen kann sie stehen ziemlich unter druck viel mehr als wir ich bin mir sicher sie werden phasen haben in denen nicht viel geht hoffentlich k nnen wir davon profitieren
3680079 well were wearing these satellite dish sized visors and sun block with an spf of 720 even though its midnight because two percent of the damaging uv rays can still cause skin damage
3680080 in my day we beat our children with nail spiked canes and they thanked us for it but you go right ahead ask your child to use your angry words and see how far you get
3680081 we didnt have condos we had cardboard shacks toilet paper we used poison ivy we ate mold for breakfast and squirrels boiled in used bathwater for dinner it built character but you wouldnt know anything about that with your fancy subzero fridge and viking stove
3680082 ysee we get to the restaurant by 4 29 on fish fry tuesday so we can use the early bird coupons and get free hot fudge sundaes
3680083 whats his license plate number i have half a mind to call the police and report him
3680084 ahh some me time the kids are sleeping i can now spend time on myself
3680085 today is really the culmination of the 50 football festivals we have throughout the uk and teams from each of those are here for the unbelievable opportunity of playing here at wembley
3680086 ive been involved with the coaching programme for six or seven years now weve got 13 000 coaches out there delivering probably two million hours worth of coaching and its something we didn t have six or seven years ago
3680087 one of the fundamental things i enjoy is when you turn up to a festival like this and you see the smiles on the kids faces were all doing this so our young children can enjoy some exercise enjoy playing sport enjoy the cameraderie and the fun you get from playing football so its just absolutely brilliant
3680088 this is something that will stay with them for the rest of their lives
3680089 to be involved in any event here at the national stadium particularly at their age because its a time when the kids will remember where they were its something that will stick with them and their family and friends the parents and grandparents are probably having as much fun as the kids are
3680090 we can all pick out the great kids even at this age within five minutes wed all come up with the same guy on one team who has stood out this isnt designed to bring new kids to play international football but it is absolutely vital that we get a wider range of kids playing the sport
3680091 i believe that the greater depth of children we have at a young age playing the sport the better chance we have at the top end of producing great players who play international football
3680092 the ausvet plan is very clear on what is required to prevent any further spread of this highly fatal disease
3680093 in these cases human health and safety must come first
3680094 in the interests of protecting people and horses from further infection euthanasia is the most appropriate response

3680108 if the courthouse is closed thatll be another service taken from ballinrobe and the locals are not prepared to stand for it
3680109 the department has no regard to the natural geography of the area this is a very bad decision they did not take a lot of things into consideration
3680110 some people now have to go into belmullet to get representation when before they had someone on their doorstep they should have put the line further down the town
3680111 there will be a huge backlash against the governing parties
3680112 we have looked closely at the figures and up to 93 people from the north west could be sent to the centre in galway which is already stretched to breaking point this in entirely inhumane and we will fight it every step of the way
3680113 these would be single issue independents and we have a number of people who might be willing to go forward all that is still being finalised but we are still getting up to 40 people at our tuesday meetings at it sligo that should increase once the holidays are over
3680114 we have already had a leaflet campaign in sligo town giving people the facts when people begin to realise that this is a case of death by geography they very quickly see the hypocrisy of people like minister jimmy devins who said one thing in sligo and then voted against a retention motion when he was in the dail since that motion was defeated no fianna fail members have attended the campaign meetings for fear of the taoiseachs reaction
3680115 sligo borough council could certainly see changes there is potential for seats to be taken there maybe also in the electoral areas closer to the bigger towns there may be support one thing is certain there will be a backlash on polling day against members of the government parties
3680116 but to lose a junior minister from the county to another department has been extremely disappointing
3680117 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3680118 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
3680119 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
3680120 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
3680121 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3680122 im not lucid right now im saying funny things give me a half hour and ill talk
3680123 everything has been done out in the open i have a reputation i do not want the fans of cleveland or honest caring people to think that i cheated
3680124 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3680125 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3680126 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3680127 i would have liked to medal but i got my first personal best of the meet and i think thats a good effort
3680128 i cant be upset with that and im just moving on to the next heat
3680129 but taking over the offense that happens later right now im just trying to get into the groove get everything clicking and get everyone on the same page
3680130 the one thing you wonder about is the durability hes got to understand that 20 plays into 2004 ricky santos had to take somebodys place thats why backup kevin deckers got to feel like hes the starter and theres going to be competition
3680131 me and r j played together freshman year so im used to him
3680132 hes a very good quarterback so its easy for the receivers to adjust and its easy for r j to adjust were a tight team
3680133 it has all the makings of a real good line
3680134 were all trying to get the chemistry this camp so we can work well heading into the season
3680135 somewhere along the line out of those seven or eight guys weve got to get four guys who can start and others who can come in and play
3680136 were going to try to do what we did two years ago with dan wagner brendan st peter and marvin wright inside and on the outside trying to get three of them in a rotation
3680137 the opener is definitely going to fly by and be here before we know it
3680138 but the key is you cant look ahead 3 weeks youve got to focus on getting better and better day by day
3680139 we will be one of the very few airlines in europe to grow strongly this winter and at least to break even if not to make a small profit
3680140 if we do it will be a small amount of money essentially this year we will break even during a year when oil has doubled
3680141 the underlying business is still growing at a time when if you take our largest competitor british airways bay l their short haul traffic is in decline
3680142 its a lot faster im still getting used to college football and everything that comes with it
3680143 im looking forward to traveling with the team since i didnt get to last year
3680144 this offseason i was along with 60 other guys up here and its different it was a good bonding experience with the team and we got a lot of work done
3680145 hes got a lot of potential and hes very athletic
3680146 i think he will be competing for his position he has some good people in front of him right now but hell put up a good fight if i know rod hell put up a very good fight
3680147 a lot of time for young guys in our program the key for them is special teams
3680148 its for those guys to earn the trust of the coaches and get their feet wet a little bit special teams is walkers route right now to find his way on the field
3680149 we are trying to find the best 11 on defense and the best 11 on offense so if walker finds himself there he will absolutely start there is no preconceived notion on where guys will end up as we go through things
3680150 i mean they are welcome to watch and find out but im not even sure what that is yet
3680151 roddy stayed here this summer and worked very very hard on what he was doing
3680152 hes in great shape but it only goes to how far he wants it to go if he works hard theres not a question about it
3680153 its a big difference from portsmouth high school but footballs football
3680154 the one thing about rod is hes trying to be like a sponge and soak this all up now hes got to figure out how to put it all into place
3680155 on fait pas tout et nimporte quoi et puis quon croit quon va arriver l bas et faire un one man show
3680156 quand elle tait forte elle tait la 8 montr al elle tait championne du monde faut pas aller chercher midi 14h cest que le travail

3680160 as the 19th century came to a close the american electorate changed more and more rapidly
3680161 a military force serving the interests of the democratic party
3680162 revive the dead and hateful race and sectional animosities in any part of our common country
3680163 means confusion distraction of business and the reopening of wounds now happily healed
3680164 when i use a word humpty dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less
3680165 with the election of harry truman democrats began the fight to bring down the final barriers of race
3680166 democrats began to bring down the final barriers of race
3680167 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
3680168 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
3680169 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
3680170 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
3680171 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
3680172 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
3680173 who will be the next president of the united states
3680174 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
3680175 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
3680176 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
3680177 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
3680178 i have a record of reaching across the aisle and working with my friends whether it be joe lieberman or ted kennedy
3680179 americans are tired of partisanship they want us to work together for america in a bipartisan fashion
3680180 who have a clear record of strict adherence to the constitution of the united states and who do not believe in legislating from the bench
3680181 we will fix social security and we will do it in a bipartisan fashion
3680182 he needs social conservatives to rally to his cause they are the bulwark of the party but he has to attract the middle
3680183 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
3680184 whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
3680185 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
3680186 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
3680187 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
3680188 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
3680189 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
3680190 i cant tell someone that just registering and voting is going to change their life
3680191 the system itself is broken due to the creation of safe districts for incumbent legislators we have the least competitive legislative races in the nation with most seats being uncontested and the sad reality is that 98 percent of the candidates who spend the most money are the ones who win
3680192 we need to build a base of support a movement for social justice that politicians will have to respect
3680193 we are registering people to vote not to support a particular candidate but to become part of the movement that will have the power to actualize our values
3680194 what always horrifies me is that no matter what side of the political spectrum youre on there is a relatively small number of people who actually elect our public servants
3680195 weve done a deal with charlton ill be disappointed to lose him
3680196 tickets for the reception where clooney will speak are going for 1 000 followed by a dinner at the home of nfc member charles adams for 10 000 a plate space for the dinner is limited to 75 guests
3680197 maybe during the convention the republicans can dedicate a large screen monitor at the xcel center to keep track of obamas second european jaunt of the campaign they could call it where in the world is barack obama the show could track him through the summer houses of the rich and famous americans who can afford to own villas overseas and put dollar signs up on a map wherever he stops off for some foie gras
3680198 could not be more clear between one candidate john mccain who has experience and has been tested in war and tried in peace and another candidate that has not between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not between one candidate thats a talker and one candidate whos the leader america needs as our next president
3680199 clever negative advertising works that is reality the tactic meets with media and pundit disapproval and spawns accusations of negativity but the reality is that a clever negative ad can be devastatingly effective
3680200 the populations seem to be gradually going downhill and its not clear if or when thats going to stop
3680201 within a decade we may not have any in washington unless they do something
3680202 i have not lost hope for spotted owls but i think were at a pretty serious crossroads
3680203 theres no way at this point to predict how this will ultimately play out
3680204 someone described it as a bathtub its just filling up with barred owls
3680205 if you get a room of field biologists people who have been out in areas where barred owls are present in any number you dont get any disagreement about it
3680206 as a society we may choose not to control barred owls but we ought to do it with the knowledge of what would it take and is it feasible
3680207 you could shoot barred owls forever and as soon as you quit theyre going to be right back
3680208 theyre pulling the habitat rug out from underneath a declining species
3680209 there really isnt any evidence to suggest that creating more habitat reserves will alter adult owl survivorship
3680210 all youre doing is protecting more habitat for the barred owl
3680211 in a seven hour span friday detroit mayor kwame kilpatrick endured a surreal journey that found him pleading to get out of jail in the morning facing a pair of new felony charges shortly afterward standing glumly for an eerie video arraignment in the afternoon and finally arriving back at city hall wearing jeans a dress shirt and electronic tether
3680212 the mayor is simply less intimidating today with a tether around his ankle than he was in 2002 or 2003 when he was firing cops who disagreed with him
3680213 others were more explicit about how they thought the distraction should be brought to an end several area leaders made or renewed calls for kilpatrick to either resign or be removed from office some did so quietly while others made public statements
3680214 its going to be broadcast all around the world and its one more blow that the city of detroit should not have to take and for that matter it involves in a negative way the image of the entire region
3680215 if youre doing business in the city of detroit if you own assets in the city of detroit if your corporate headquarters or other buildings that you own and operate out of are operating in the city of detroit you have a voice you have a stake in what happens in this city and you ought to be using that voice to express your concerns about your stake in this city
3680216 the punishment is too harsh for the players who did not commit any offence
3680217 i am surprised the tff did punish the leaders who made the decision to pull out the team
3680218 fifa statutes provide for fines and not bans like this so the committee has decided to quash the two year ban and the club will pay the fine instead
3680219 we are a country in re construction we are a country in movement the war was over six years ago
3680220 and you can notice what the changes are that this country is going through from north to south from west to east and in the centre
3680221 therefore this is a task that the angolans will perform and like the president says we will have a successful nations cup
3680222 an investor doesnt really need to know our tv results in order to know whether to buy and sell our shares
3680223 but our competitor in tv sure as hell wants to know and thats why we havent disclosed
3680224 when youre at the formative stages of launching a major service that you are doing for long term strategic reasons you can do without the scrutiny of did you go up or down or jeez you really knocked their socks off this quarter which creates the emotion for the other guy to drop price and retaliate
3680225 theres a lot of benefit for going under the radar
3680226 in a sense its still early days and we wanted to extend the first round on the mayo news because this is generally a quiet month in the industry weve set a target of early september for offers in writing after that well draw up the shortlist and things should progress fairly quickly from there
3680227 we will narrow the field down to two or three parties after weve seen the initial offers
3680228 that process is likely to be completed by late september
3680229 it is different to the radio market where five stations were recently offered as a package these print titles are being offered completely separately
3680230 in november 2006 mary harney provided an answer in the d il claiming that the governments commitment to increase total acute bed capacity is virtually complete
3680231 between 2005 and 2007 the net gain for in patient beds amounted to just 10 across the country the knock on effect on mayo was that only five extra beds were provided
3680232 other neighbouring counties such as roscommon had an overall loss of hospital beds further displayed the mis information being provided by the government the 200 patients on trolleys around the country each day in july can blame the minister for healths failure to increase capacity
3680233 if the minister for health wants an explanation as to why roscommon patients are being treated elsewhere all she needs to do is look at these figures with the significant reduction in the available capacity at roscommon hospital
3680234 overall there was a reduction of 14 beds in the capacity of the hospitals in the region which forces people to travel to gain access to medical treatment
3680235 how can the minister for health minister finneran and the health service executive hse demand that people support the hospital when it is not available at certain times to take admissions
3680236 we have met some absolutely fabulous people who want to support us and we have had a lot of interest from museums institutions and fibre arts organisations from around the world
3680237 and out of that work came a particular ministry of care he was forever visiting people in hospital bringing them messages contacting their relatives going out of his way to help in any way he could
3680238 he was a wonderful person he was fun generous naughty drank too much and loved his children he just wanted to be himself he wanted real life tourmakeady gave him that he didnt like the razzmatazz of hollywood
3680239 possibly the only completely unspoilt place in which i have ever lived
3680240 she spotted these shoes hanging around the place and told me about it id suspect that this is more than likely young people blackguarding than anything more sinister something similar was done near heneghans health food store on ellison street
3680241 however for anyone passing through the area from out of town its not something that reflects very well on castlebar and ill be looking to have these articles removed
3680242 these shacks lack basic amenities such as running water electricity and sanitation the residents are highly susceptible to the elements such as fires floods the wind and the rain
3680243 sarah and i and all the people who donate this weekend can go back to our nice warm houses take a shower and sleep in comfortable beds but the people living in the shacks never have that luxury
3680244 we hope that everyone who contributes this weekend realises that were sleeping out in a shack so that deserving families who are living in substandard houses today can have a decent place to call home in the future
3680245 no one in the democratic party would want to be publicly associated with him
3680246 he was raised as one of us the son of a mill worker he always said
3680247 fighting poverty and providing health care for everybody i hope those are still always his beliefs
3680248 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible secretary of labor
3680249 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3680250 he was the first person since lyndon johnson to address it in a meaningful way
3680251 he was very sincere about wanting to cure the problems
3680252 hes going to have to rebuild his base from the bottom
3680253 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway i mean im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3680254 they say barack im a republican but i support you
3680255 republicans are coming together in support of senator obama to bring change to washington
3680256 strong record s of bringing people together from the left and the right to solve problems
3680257 georgia is a stable state and is developing an investor friendly low cost environment
3680258 please help us shrink the supply of oil and block refinery and nuclear plant construction so that the price of gasoline and power will be so expensive well have to live like our great grandparents without cars modern electric powered appliances airplanes and without the things made in factories and raised on modern farms
3680259 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
3680260 propensity to vote is in part based on enthusiasm but its more typically assessed using voting history and intention among other factors
3680261 when youre talking about campaign funds they cant be used for personal use you cant use campaign funds to buy yachts or go out to barbados
3680262 friends can give gifts to people up to a certain limit beyond that its income to the recipient
3680263 whether its an in kind contribution if they were paying her for something that was not campaign work probably not
3680264 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its committment to georgias territorial integrity that committment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their committment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense committment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
3680265 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week
3680266 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3680267 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3680268 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3680269 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3680270 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3680271 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3680272 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3680273 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3680274 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3680275 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3680276 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3680277 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3680278 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3680279 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
3680280 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3680281 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3680282 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
3680283 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
3680284 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3680285 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3680286 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3680287 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3680288 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3680289 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3680290 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3680291 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3680292 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3680293 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3680294 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3680295 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3680296 c tait une question dint r t national lenfant devait bien passer devant la cam ra tre expressive

3680298 i ever only had one car because the other was a government jag
3680299 kinnock said you cant be transport minister and drive a jag
3680300 when you get on an aeroplane do you go and see if the pilots smiling
3680301 hello this is john prescott please go out and vote
3680302 i said gordon brown is the right man for the job at the end of the day they believed in those times that that ship could never sink the captain still had a responsibility but the thing that actually sank it was the iceberg the challenge is how do you navigate around it
3680303 to elsie i think that we do not have a real good choice with either candidate but i fail to see how you think obama will help with our moral decline as he apparently is a strong supporter of abortion and gay rights
3680304 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3680305 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3680306 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3680307 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3680308 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3680309 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3680310 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3680311 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3680312 som det vert sagt fr gamalt av liten blogg betre enn ingen
3680313 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
3680314 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3680315 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3680316 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3680317 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3680318 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
3680319 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
3680320 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
3680321 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
3680322 i dont know how to better represent them than to sit here with a gold medal in my hand
3680323 schiphol is discriminating by charging passengers that depart from the netherlands twice as much as transfer passengers
3680324 passenger service charges are going up mostly due to inflation while costs for security continue to rise
3680325 three foreign women employees of irc international rescue committee and their local driver were killed in this ambush by the opposition forces
3680326 work at home con artists have always preyed most heavily upon senior citizens the disabled mothers who want to stay at home with their children people with low income and few job skills and people who just want to get rich quick
3680327 luckily it stayed dry all day and the sun broke through just after lunch
3680328 and the water was 64 degrees so that was a blessing
3680329 we felt like we were the only buddhists in clovis
3680330 i was just drawn to it started studying and reading about it and liked what i read
3680331 i always have a better day when i mediate in the morning
3680332 this is our goal where there is a religious or spiritual need we want to accommodate that
3680333 we were delighted with how the reunion went it was emotional for many to see friends from years ago
3680334 that was a special moment for everyone its amazing to think that after all this time pupils could still remember them
3680335 everyone who came really enjoyed it and it was special to see people get together after such a long time
3680336 there are a large number of voluntary organisations in fox ford doing fantastic work and they are doing it very quietly
3680337 foxford has so many natural advantages and its just a case of realising the potential of these assets for example the river moy is on our doorstep yet we have still to develop proper tourism facilities such as riverside walks we also have the lakes in pontoon only a short distance away and again there is an awful lot of unrealised potential in that general area the development association is working to make things happen in the town either through its relationship with mayo co council or with other public bodies we have a lot of exciting plans and we are very hopeful that the next few years will see a lot of positive developments in the town
3680338 house prices in foxford would be significantly lower than either castlebar or ballina and thats a big attraction to people who might be working in either of those towns but have no problem commuting to work
3680339 the development association would also argue that there is a much better quality of life in foxford and we are also blessed with excellent educational facilties these are all important factors when couples are choosing where to live
3680340 i think the purchase of jones and woods properties was the single biggest development to occur in foxford in a long number of years
3680341 the new link road has opened up so much land for development and it will only be in years to come that we will see the full benefits of the council acquisitions
3680342 there is an awful lot to be positive about in foxford at the moment
3680343 and we have a lot to thank the celtic tiger for the town is certainly in a far better position than it was ten years ago
3680344 the playground has been a huge success but we also want to develop walkways in different areas
3680345 we have a walkway going up to br id but there are lots of other areas where we would like to develop walkways both for locals and tourists the sports centre is also proving to be a huge success and it is a great asset for the town
3680346 if we can continue to develop our tourism facilities the future of the town will be very bright
3680347 the natural resources are there so all we have to do is tap into their potential
3680348 we also have a transport issue on the east coast our centre is going to be st vincents hospital and that already sees patients from as far away as wexford carlow and kilkenny public transport is available but for a cancer patient its not really the best option as they are tied to a timetable that might not suit and there are other considerations when someone isnt feeling well
3680349 the issue of getting to the hospital was brought to our attention through our oncology social workers and our support groups who bring us the patients direct experiences
3680350 the response was very encouraging and we began to look at what kind of a model might suit our needs in canada theres been a volunteer driver service for the last 30 years
3680351 the scale of the service is simply huge but there were really useful policies and systems that we were able to tailor to meet the needs of patients at st vincents
3680352 the aim is to have a car and driver made available each time a patient needs to attend
3680353 they are picked up from their door and taken to the door of the hospital if they need help getting to the ward that is arranged when they are ready they are taken back to their home its a much more personalised service
3680354 we had an absolutely fantastic response we got 120 respondents and there is still a steady stream applying one of the really nice things is that we have a lot of men on the books
3680355 when we asked them why they signed up they said it was the practical nature of the service
3680356 most volunteers have had some kind of contact with cancer a number are survivors or have experienced cancer through a family member only around five per cent have no experience of cancer at all
3680357 we have groups of up to 50 brought together at the very start of the process at that point we go through exactly what the scheme is about the demands on their time the practicalities then we ask them to go away and consider if this is really for them once we go through garda vetting and reference checks theres a training day which goes through a number of details many are simply related to the condition of the car down to the very simple things like ensuring theres enough petrol before the driver goes to collect the patient theres also some basic training in listening and communication issues like that
3680358 we ask drivers to do a minimum of two journeys a month many do more than that but it varies a great deal we always work around peoples availability holidays and so on
3680359 the irish cancer society is a totally voluntary organisation we have committed funding for the pilot project and that is quite a burden all of our finances are generated through voluntary efforts across the country
3680360 we would see the best way to develop the service as providing start up capital for other organisations or even hospitals themselves
3680361 chemotherapy will be available in mayo and sligo so there could be the possibilty of basing a volunteer driver service at those facilities
3680362 we would definitely see mayo cancer support association playing a central role but it wouldnt necessarily have to be a cancer related group there are rural transport schemes community groups and others who could also play a role
3680363 my partner and i were living in england hes irish james mccourt a writer
3680364 there was that great sense of community except when i left the house then there was a bit of mystery to me one person stopped jimmy and asked if i ate garlic it was extraordinary
3680365 when jimmy was around 12 he went to the met in new york he fell in love with an opera singer victoria de los angeles she was one of the greats he fell in love with her as a kid he went backstage and introduced himself and victoria was completely enchanted by this 12 year old and they became very close friends every time she came to new york he would meet her he visited her on her tours in europe when jimmy and i met victoria entered my life too we were groupies twenty five years ago victoria came to dublin and invited jimmy jimmy met anne fuller who was organising the concert in dublin they really got on she invited him to spend a summer in a flat beside her house in dublin we arrived on july 4 anne had been married to an american so every year she would give a huge party in her garden it was one of those great experiences we met all of these wonderful people and that strengthened our irish base that was 1982 we came to dublin for the next three summers
3680366 i began to think id like to branch out and find a little place where we could go for a couple of months
3680367 john oconnor the pianist was a close friend of annes
3680368 so we stayed at enniscoe house and then we went back to dublin and i said to anne oh my god mayo
3680369 i called a friend of annes called timothy ryeland who has a house on the lake at errew the house came with a car which was an automatic i said to jimmy the gods are really taking care of us here we saw the house which is the most perfect place that was 18 years ago the next year timothy called me all excited because hed gotten a newish car and it was a stick shift so i arrived and mary omalley who has become a very close friend of ours she took care of the house she and her late husband joseph taught me how to drive a stick shift im really good at driving now
3680370 i have a degree in english and psychology i then went of yale graduate school of drama and then i needed work i made two phone calls i needed work james had just published a piece for the literary journal
3680371 the real break came when i was working at simon and schuster as a freelancer with michael korda who was then the editor in chief he gave me a collection of 12 songs by john wayne called
3680372 i knew agnes myer who was the random house picture editor she told me i couldnt do that that she couldnt do that but i said i gotta do this i gotta pay my rent
3680373 things just evolved after the john wayne book michael gave me another manuscript and things took off from there
3680374 my job basically involves researching editing and designing the picture sections in books im the one who finds the images who works with the authors and who designs the pictures and sketches out all the captions im the only person in the publishing industry who does all three
3680375 most of the books i do use the photos in isolated inserts and i have complained about this because they ought to run throughout
3680376 ive done over 150 of these books the last ones were for the clintons hilarys living history and bills my life theyre always pressurised and budgets are tight
3680377 i actually approach maps as cultural documents because i dont get maps i never really understood maps and i think its because most historians are visually illiterate so all the history of course they never use maps as cultural documents they never use them as primary documents they never use them
3680378 when i told the people at the library that i didnt get maps ron graham the specialist in the maps division put his head on the table and said that is the story of my life
3680379 to grasp the arabic sensibility thats anther nine months thats to get a basic understanding once i got a basic understanding i began to work with the maps in earnest
3680380 cartographia is the most beautiful book imaginable its amazing that was another reason it became so successful
3680381 its scary you go on line and type in the word photography and up come millions of entries there are three billion photographs taken every day people are taking all these pictures but theyre not very literate visually
3680382 now people are taking pictures with their phones but theyre not framing the images theyre just pointing and shooting when you look through a view finder you have to make choices nowadays people just holding up an automatic camera and they push a button and take all these pictures it really is the accidental art as its been called
3680383 ive published three novels and im working on a new one my novels are like films i see them first and then i translate them into words once i begin writing the words do tend to take over i work with both the word and the image
3680384 when i went to france to work recently i was inspired by the mystery of those french villages you drive in and they look like one street and then you make a left and you go into these rabbit warrens where there are all these houses in the novel im writing now my characters run away i didnt know where they were going to run to but now i do theyre going to saint bonnet du gard i have in my head exactly what that looks like and i know exactly what theyre going to do
3680385 the publishing world is now controlled by the sales people things have become very very chaotic when im in crossmolina its different here im working on novels im also working on a companion to
3680386 you cant get to the playoffs like this very disappointing when you have a team down like that i dont care if its the red sox pittsburgh pirates or kansas city royals coming back the way we did you have to win that game it hurts i dont know what else to do
3680387 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3680388 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3680389 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3680390 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3680391 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3680392 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3680393 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3680394 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3680395 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3680396 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3680397 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3680398 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3680399 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3680400 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3680401 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3680402 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3680403 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3680404 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3680405 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3680406 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3680407 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3680408 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3680409 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3680410 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3680411 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3680412 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3680413 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3680414 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3680415 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3680416 this is an enormous waste of law enforcement resources that should be focused on violent and serious crime
3680417 an addictive drug which induces in its users insanity criminality and death
3680418 the perception that marijuana is about fun and freedom it isnt its about dependency disease and dysfunction
3680419 not soon but eventually youll see the development of a marijuana futures market
3680420 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3680421 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3680422 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3680423 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3680424 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3680425 just so you all know we did set a record
3680426 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3680427 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3680428 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3680429 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3680430 doesnt look like all those presidents on the dollar bills
3680431 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
3680432 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
3680433 when fuel gets more expensive wont voters object just as strenuously as they would have if a carbon tax had been imposed in the first place
3680434 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
3680435 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3680436 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3680437 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3680438 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3680439 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3680440 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3680441 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3680442 real results by the end of my first term in office
3680443 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
3680444 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
3680445 the reign of charlemagne was greatly aided by a general improvement in the weather during the eight and ninth centuries
3680446 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
3680447 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3680448 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3680449 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
3680450 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
3680451 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3680452 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states
3680453 how the gop is moving to examine these surges in the voting rolls
3680454 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3680455 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3680456 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3680457 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3680458 it looks like its going slow but theres a lot of torque generated which can make the gears go faster
3680459 on the low end 30 mph wind could generate about 500 watts
3680460 when he was growing up i was cleaning up his room and i remember finding this thing that looked like a bomb
3680461 i dont know how he learned but he knows how
3680462 he knows how to build everything hes always on the computer reading about how things work
3680463 he first got interested in physics and then when we went to louisiana he got interested in meteorology
3680464 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3680465 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3680466 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3680467 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3680468 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3680469 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3680470 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3680471 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3680472 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3680473 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3680474 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3680475 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3680476 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3680477 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
3680478 are you better off now than you were four years ago
3680479 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3680480 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis

3680486 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3680487 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3680488 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3680489 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3680490 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3680491 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3680492 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3680493 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3680494 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3680495 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3680496 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3680497 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3680498 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
3680499 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3680500 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
3680501 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
3680502 he nader is a reminder that the democratic process is alive and well and still being practiced
3680503 radio serves you meatloaf and you know theres steak back in the kitchen
3680504 the scale of the casualties of the war as devastating as they are today was greater back then in vietnam
3680505 plus there was a draft young people then and now are consumers of popular music and there would have been more urgency back then about current events and that would be felt in the kind of music theyd be demanding
3680506 people want to be able to escape when they go into a movie theater put on their ear buds or pick up a trash novel were the stakes higher it wouldnt be as easy to simply escape and you might see more willingness to engage things that address the state of the world
3680507 it causes radio to become more of a mirror rather than a leader
3680508 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or react thats considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word
3680509 why would any musician whos ambitious care about what radio stations think theyre not stupid they know radio stations wont play something controversial college public and satellite radio might play it though the other interesting thing about this is that even the toby keith jingoistic material is at a minimum
3680510 in my business theres a term called being dixie chick ed
3680511 ashamed the president of the united states is from texas
3680512 even if some artists might support the war or mccain it would be an unpopular decision to say so and that translates into what youre seeing in music right now a lot of fear
3680513 i hear it all the time on a consumer level a lot of people are getting fed up with the type of music being played
3680514 they played the song once and theyd get a flood of phone calls
3680515 the stations are still after ratings but there are songs that will come through and will alter whats acceptable and push the boundaries id be very surprised if we didnt start seeing more of this
3680516 anti war music has come and gone in waves over the past few years
3680517 while it was easy to believe that artists had been scared into silence many just needed a year or two to get an album out similarly a lot of songs with references to hurricane katrina are just coming out now so we could indeed have the next big statement sitting as a demo on some artists laptop as we speak
3680518 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3680519 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3680520 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3680521 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3680522 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3680523 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3680524 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3680525 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3680526 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3680527 the involvement of charities means that not only will the film inspire people to act but we can also give them a way to put this inspiration to use afterwards
3680528 we want people to realise that they have the power to resist
3680529 we hope that ngos will be able to tell their members about the project driving more people to the site when we make the film hopefully it will inspire more people to visit the site and join the resist network continuing the whole process
3680530 in most cases the support is not just financial we have worked with all sorts of films including features such as blood diamond in the past people came to us with completed projects and asked us for support but now we work in a more holistic way from script development and research onwards
3680531 if the film maker wants to tell both sides of the story they can do that
3680532 we support freedom of expression any storytelling is positive for us if it shines a light on what is happening in the world we get involved to tell our side of the story correctly documentaries can be overwhelming if they do not contain a solution to the problems they highlight ngos can give that al gores film ended with an example of what people can do people are ripe for that kind of activism
3680533 then we went to britdoc and its organisers supported us pitching for funding when people have seen what we have made we want them to feel inspired to act
3680534 we got involved with britdoc two years ago because we thought documentaries were an effective way of getting complicated issues which cant be summed up in a soundbite through to the public erasing david looks like it will be entertaining and this makes it more accessible which is perfect when trying to interest people in a debate
3680535 it is easy to see how these collaborations can work with subjects such as science if there is transparency
3680536 but i think that where for example a film maker wants to make a documentary on the international criminal court one needs to be particularly careful that both sides of the argument are properly analysed
3680537 i sense that film makers often want to make a film and they are not too concerned where they come from i am a journalist and i like to see things investigated with a critical eye when there is more than one view on a topic we need to be careful about where backing comes from
3680538 i cant think of subjective journalism that i have a problem with if it is marked as subjective and clear
3680539 most journalism is already subjective even if it is labelled as objective i am suspicious of all organisations including news organisations there always needs to be proper controls to protect editorial integrity for ngos collaboration wont work if they ask for something too specific but if say they want to fund increased reporting from congo it can work
3680540 there used to be five broadcasters paying high sums for documentaries now with for example the probability that itv will be able to reduce its public service commitments everything is different commercial and third sector brands can invest in documentaries if it is done sensibly
3680541 you need people who will email friends and walk the streets to talk about a project third sector people care enough to do that
3680542 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3680543 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3680544 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3680545 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3680546 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3680547 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3680548 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3680549 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3680550 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3680551 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3680552 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3680553 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3680554 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3680555 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3680556 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3680557 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3680558 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3680559 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3680560 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3680561 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3680562 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3680563 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3680564 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3680565 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3680566 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3680567 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3680568 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3680569 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3680570 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3680571 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3680572 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3680573 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3680574 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3680575 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3680576 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3680577 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3680578 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3680579 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3680580 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3680581 there are beliefs taught with varying degrees of authority a
3680582 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3680583 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life

3680587 development which meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs
3680588 recognised the importance of affordable and convenient energy in achieving that whilst underlining the importance of protecting the environment
3680589 claims should always avoid the vague use of terms such as sustainable green non polluting and so on
3680590 because sustainable was an ambiguous term and because we had not seen data that showed how shell was effectively managing carbon emissions from its oil sands projects in order to limit climate change we concluded that on this point the ad was misleading

3680782 the violence was vicious and bloody in street after street in colombo groups of rioters hit only at shops and factories as well as homes owned by tamils troops and police almost exclusively sinhalese either joined the rioters or stood idly by the events were so well organized no one doubts that there was a master list of targets
3680783 while accounts of these massacres are circulating widely among sri lankas tamil population it is the massacres in the welikada gaol which are attracting the most attention there is particular interest in circumstances in which two alleged guerrilla leaders were killed
3680784 tamil tiger rebels have inflicted awesome damage on sri lankas only international airport in what was their most audacious attack since they assassinated the president eight years ago

3680809 i have spoken to him he will play in moscow
3680810 no one wants to miss this gigantic match the match of our careers thats the case for me anyway
3680811 it will play itself out over 90 or 120 minutes like in the fa cup final last year which chelsea won 1 0 thanks to drogbas goal in the second half of extra time
3680812 we know that we can beat united we proved it again in the league a fortnight ago
3680813 but they deserved their title and were rewarded for their consistency we made too many mistakes
3680814 at the moment the only thing i have in my mind is the final in moscow
3680815 what will happen in june or july i still dont know anything
3680816 i had trouble getting used to chelsea and i wanted to leave at the end of every season not because people were not treating me well rather because of personal reasons
3680817 i have started everything again from zero in england i had to replace a great striker in jimmy floyd hasselbaink who was a favourite at the club
3680818 it wasnt easy but my relationship with the english supporters has evolved remember me
3680819 the transfer window is open until august 31 and we need a midfielder lampard is at chelsea but i have worked really well with him
3680820 i like quaresma but he is at porto anyway the squad needs trimming i want to work with 22 players at most plus the goalkeepers
3680821 but tomorrow i want to see him really tired after the first training session
3680822 if i arrive at training an hour and half early i cannot accept it if someone arrives late

3680824 there will be linguistic conservatives who will turn their nose up at a word like ginormous

3680827 i think norman rockwell resonates with the american public far more than a lot of artists do
3680828 he painted a broad stroke across the american nostalgic theme everyone still looks back and talks about how wonderful that world is
3680829 people have come up to us and have told us stories about how they knew norman rockwell he has touched a lot of lives
3680830 one day i got a call from a lady in ohio saying im booking a flight if you can promise me two tickets
3680831 happily ive always loved his stuff just about everything he painted had a story to it
3680832 im hoping that the public has as much fun at it as weve had creating it
3680833 the friendship represents early maritime trade of new england and the united states
3680834 her role is to educate the public about early maritime trade and one of the ways she does that is to sail to other ports and with our onboard rangers tell the story
3680835 i think what makes it interesting is the friendship is actually a national parks service tall ship

3680840 i cant think of a better character than duke or a better franchise than the trilogy to usher in a new era for apogee
3680841 its funny how whats old is new again in this industry
3680842 many of the things apogee pioneered are back in style so it only makes sense to bring back apogee and its properties with a visionary team that will once again create innovation for gamers around the world
3680843 if you could only track three new media metrics what would they be
3680844 in planning for the web 2 0 summit event this year we have been inspired to look beyond our immediate needs and into a space that transforms limits into opportunities

3680853 the hp intel and yahoo cloud computing test bed furthers our commitment to the global collaborative research community that is advancing the new sciences of the internet
3680854 with this test bed not only can researchers test applications at internet scale they will also have access to the underlying computing systems to advance understanding of how systems software and hardware function in a cloud environment
3680855 to realize the full potential of cloud computing the technology industry must think about the cloud as a platform for creating new services and experiences this requires an entirely new approach to the way we design deploy and manage cloud infrastructure and services
3680856 the hp intel and yahoo cloud computing test bed lets us tap the brightest minds in the industry academia and government to drive innovation in this area
3680857 we are pleased to engage with the academic research community open collaboration with the academia is in our dna at intel research
3680858 creating large scale test beds is important because they lower barriers to innovation and provide the opportunity to experiment and learn at scale intels support of tashi an open source cluster management system for cloud computing and this hp intel yahoo cloud computing test bed are a natural extension of our ongoing mutually beneficial partnerships with the research community such as the universal parallel computing research centers
3680859 with the ready and available internet scale resources in singapore to support cloud computer research and development work we can collaborate with like minded partners to advance the field

3680862 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3680863 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3680864 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3680865 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3680866 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3680867 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3680868 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3680869 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3680870 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3680871 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3680872 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3680873 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3680874 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3680875 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3680894 officers in this case have spent many days trawling through cctv from stations between farningham road and victoria and have taken numerous witness statements from members of the public
3680895 id like to take this opportunity to thank those members of the public who came forward and provided us with invaluable information to assist us in this investigation
3680896 the bus collided with the van and in turn moved off the road and hit a guard rail

3680900 were really talking about taking a look with a very different lens
3680901 we thought we were covering our tracks by doing it all before we were told youre not going to find anything in beijing and if you do theres a chance that it may not be real
3680902 i think it is due to the weather conditions the hot humid weather and rain i think from today there will be more spectators in the stadiums the tickets are sold out thats correct
3680903 ich glaube nicht dass es dieselbe berlegenheit der bayern geben wird wie im letzten jahr es wird am ende zwar wohl wieder f r den titel reichen trotzdem bin ich sicher dass wir vor einer sehr spannenden saison stehen
3680904 as you probably know i have been pretty quiet about the whereabouts of the band and the future and id like to inform you that we are on indefinite hiatus for now i feel that it is too early to continue or try to continue without vitek and or covan at this particular moment
3680905 regarding covan hes recovering now and needs all the time in the world to comeback to a normal life so i want to wait for him so we could both decide what the future will hold for decapitated
3680906 i definitely want to keep on playing and touring as its very important for me to keep on playing music
3680907 i also want to express my respect for everyone who has supported the families of vitek and covan on any kind of way since the accident
3680908 i think any time you put up 10 runs in a game its a good one
3680909 it doesnt matter what team youre playing just getting those first game jitters out
3680910 that was the big difference between others who participated in the final
3680911 to others this might be a supreme glory but i just took it as a competition
3680912 the first fencer i fought had a very strong technique which better suited my fencing style i prefer attacks which give me more time to react
3680913 the italian sanzo in my second bout was very fast and because of his style i had little time to react he dominated throughout the competition
3680914 i grow my tomatoes in pots because that way i know they are organic
3680915 in general there is a surge of interest in having a vegetable garden
3680916 sales of seeds have gone up by some accounts by as much as 20 to 40 percent

3680934 it is not simply that three quarters of those living on less than 2 a day still depend in some way on commonly held resources the concept of the commons is also spreading to new areas
3680935 when economists began to look at how systems of commonly managed resources actually worked they found to their surprise that they often worked quite well swiss alpine pastures japanese forests irrigation systems in spain and the philippines all these were examples of commons that lasted for decades
3680936 the clean up of europes busiest waterway should be seen as an example of successful commons management because it was not until local pressure groups city and regional governments and non governmental organisations got involved that polluters were willing to recognise the costs they were imposing on others and cut emissions an inter governmental body the international commission for the protection of the rhine did not have the same effect
3680937 die konomie der neuen commons steckt noch in den kinderschuhen es ist zu fr h ihren hypothesen zu vertrauen

3680987 she has actually created negative and adversarial relationships with which the board had to deal
3680988 ive done nothing illegal nothing immoral its a real shame that the board has stopped the work i was doing
3680989 putting an interim superintendent in place is like spinning your wheels or going backwards
3680990 it allows us to focus on the present and the future and not look at the past

3681020 two fifths of all homeowners would be confused about whether to opt for a fixed or tracker rate mortgage if they were choosing a new deal tomorrow abbeys remortgage index shows that 41 per cent are unsure about what to choose as uncertainty about the economy and future base rate moves continue this compares with just 30 per cent last month
3681021 we would advise homeowners to continue saving well spending responsibly and to remain aware of the potential problems facing the housing market your financial planning should as always be geared towards making sure you are prepared for any problems that could arise
3681022 if i wish to have courage in those decisive moments when it is needed most i cannot approach every uncomfortable situation i encounter seeking the quickest and least painful means of avoiding it all those seemingly inconsequential choices i have made to avoid the unpleasant event instead of confronting it determines how i will deal with future events courage is not a quality that materializes automatically whenever it is needed courage is developed over time by conscious decisions not to back down when faced with small threats and problems and instead taking rise to the occasion of challenging fears thus when the larger threat or pivotal moment presents itself the fortified courage is ready for the new challenger however this is not to say that because of courage there will be no fear courage is not the absence of fear rather true courage is acting in the face of your fear when the danger looms ominously and the outcome is uncertain developing courage is not easy nor is it fun and in fact it will require going beyond normal security and comfort levels but in choosing to live as safe and painless a life as possible short circuiting any opportunities to build courage not only will we be inadequately prepared to respond to those events in our lives that demand courage but we will also sabotage the thrill and joy of risk involved with living
3681023 the most dangerous man on earth is the man who has reckoned with his own death
3681024 be on your guard stand firm in the faith be men of courage be strong
3681025 i eagerly expect and hope that i will in no way be ashamed but will have sufficient courage so that now as always christ will be exalted in my body whether by life or by death
3681026 we are his house if we hold on to our courage and the hope of which we boast
3681027 come let us build ourselves a city with a tower that reaches to the heavens so that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth
3681028 if as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them 7 come let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other
3681029 are not all these men who are speaking galileans 8 then how is it that each of us hears them in his own native language 9 parthians medes and elamites residents of mesopotamia judea and cappadocia pontus and asia 10 phrygia and pamphylia egypt and the parts of libya near cyrene visitors from rome 11 both jews and converts to judaism cretans and arabs we hear them declaring the wonders of god in our own tongues
3681030 i pray not only for them but also for those who believe in me because of their message ed thats us 21
3681031 ananias why did you let satan take control of you and make you lie to the holy spirit by keeping part of the money you received for the property 4 before you sold the property it belonged to you and after you sold it the money was yours why then did you decide to do such a thing you have not lied to people you have lied to god
3681032 tell me was this the full amount you and your husband received for your property
3681033 why did you and your husband decide to put the lords spirit to the test the men who buried your husband are at the door right now and they will carry you out too

3681035 come out 8 v18a so noah came out niv are you getting my point that is this is completed faith faith in action genesis 3 8 says about adam and eve then the man and his wife heard the sound of the lord god as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day and they hid from the lord god among the trees of the garden niv i believe adam and eve would have probably caught up with god as he walked in the garden if they hadnt eaten the fruit so what had happened with their walk with the lord sin and disobedience against god and his word came into their lives this brought with it guilt and shame and adam and eve hid from god their friend their relationship and walk with god was broken this is a very sad and tragic moment adam and eve no longer wanted to walk with god walking as a friend would do in the garden exodus 33 12b 14 says about mose relationship with god 12b you have said i know you by name and you have found favor with me 13 if you are pleased with me teach me your ways so i may know you and continue to find favor with you remember that this nation is your people
3681036 have you considered my servant job there is no one on earth like him he is blameless and upright a man who fears god and shuns evil
3681037 the glory of god is man fully alive and the life of man is the vision of god if the revelation of god through creation already brings life to all living beings on the earth how much more will the manifestation of the father by the word bring life to those who see god

3681059 inflation is likely to rise further this year and to peak at around 5 per cent in the coming months
3681060 it points to only limited scope for rate cuts nonetheless the tone is clearly dovish
3681061 i think with broadly flat output its bound to be the case that there is a possibility of a quarter or two of negative growth
3681062 it may still just be summer but there is a feeling of chill in the economic air
3681063 the british economy is going through a difficult and painful adjustment due to higher energy and commodity prices and in banking credit and housing markets this adjustment to our economy cannot be avoided and as a result inflation is rising and growth is slowing

3681115 i am a divorced father who was simply dropped by his wife

3681128 40 year old virgin was arrested for attempted murder of his girlfriend
3681129 we always view our activism within the frame of art and the poetic
3681130 so he started working on a locative media project called the virtual hiker he developed an algorithm that took into account a certain terrain and created a virtual trial or hike based on those algorithms
3681131 we asked ourselves what were the spaces of necessity or danger on the border and how could we plug in this new element of the gps structured cell phone
3681132 what we needed was a really inexpensive telephone one that we could crack the gps system and one that would accept new algorithms
3681133 we needed to design the interface in a way that would be somewhat universal in terms of the community that would be crossing the border
3681134 we were trying to think of many layers of communication iconic sound vibratory
3681135 the algorithm would look at it not just in terms of a map or a politics but by suggesting the most aesthetic crossing
3681136 all the immigrants that would participate would in a sense participate in a large landscape of aesthetic vision
3681137 in the next stage the research team will go to both ends of the border and work with the tools directly in terms of triangulating the info to the satellites
3681138 we hope to get them to communities that interface with people getting ready to cross
3681139 theres a long history of artists at the border creating gestures that question the very nature of the border
3681140 the reason they cant stop us is that we always frame all these gestures within the poetic frame
3681141 we know oxidants produce free radicals that damage cells our experiments show ruthenium produces a reaction in the cell which destroys its anti oxidant defence glutathione thus destroying the cancer infected cell
3681142 working with colleagues in edinburgh university and oncosense weve proved this could be an effective line of defence against cancer
3681143 the civil hospital at firozepur has an advisory committee it closely monitors all the eight ultrasound centres of the city there are random checks and surprise visits at these hospitals and ultrasound centres not even a single case of female feticide has been found as yet
3681144 pakistan is our neighboring country it has repeatedly tried to frame baseless allegations against india but indian society has a scientific mindset and all this does not affect us anymore indian government is headed by a sikh prime minister and punjab has a sikh chief minister medindia on campaign against female foeticide launched by patel community young romanian mother starves 2 year old son to death as he would not say amen
3681145 india is home to approximately 2 5 million people living with human immunodeficiency virus hiv the third largest number of cases of any country in the world and is recognized as the source of increasing hiv prevalence among its south asian neighbors
3681146 intimate partner violence ipv has been described as being associated with heterosexual transmission of hiv to women in india and elsewhere
3681147 though decades of economic research suggest men and women are equalizing in the labour market the notion that todays working women are being paid more and treated better than ever before is simply wrong
3681148 the growing equality between genders reflects the entry of the most able women to the workforce rather than better pay
3681149 while there may be more women holding high power positions today they are still being paid as their counterparts were three decades ago
3681150 most of the time these antibodies dont do much so we thought it would be useful if we could teach them to recognise hiv
3681151 the antibodies block the interaction between virus and host cell recruit molecules that will destroy infected cells and alert killer cells that will eat them
3681152 breastfeeding promotion programs encourage women to start but dont provide the support to continue

3681160 al qaeda wanted to kill me and blow up my shop because i sold music cds
3681161 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3681162 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3681163 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3681164 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3681165 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3681166 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political

3681173 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3681174 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3681175 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3681176 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3681177 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3681178 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3681179 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3681180 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3681181 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3681182 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3681183 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3681184 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3681185 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3681186 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3681289 here then are men as i wished them i drove them from eden weishaupt has driven them to the forests i taught them to offend their god he has made them reject their god entirely i had left the earth to repay them for the sweat of their brow he has stricken it with sterility for it will be in vain for them to pretend to till and sow that which they shall not reap i left them in their inequality of riches but he has swept all away he has destroyed the very idea of property he has transformed mankind into brigands their virtues happiness and greatness under the protecting laws of society or of their country was an object of jealousy to me but he has cursed their laws and their country and has reduced them to the stupid pride and ignorance of the roaming savage and vagabond clans in tempting them to sin i could not deprive them of repentance and the hope of pardon but weishaupt has taught them to scoff at crime and despise repentance villany without remorse and hopeless misfortune are all that he has left to the miserable inhabitants of the earth
3681290 its more to help us all to understand the moratorium since the announcement and bottom line to make sure all the senators who are interested have the opportunity to hear what gwa has t

3681298 i gave it up i didnt compete for it this year
3681299 im sure if i competed for it i would have won but i didnt compete for it
3681300 in zahlreichen parlamentarischen antr gen waren wir es die sich daf r eingesetzt haben den an wahnsinn grenzenden sparkurs der regierung im sicherheitsbereich zu stoppen die nunmehr bekannten fakten unz hlige ungekl rte straftaten weil kein geld f r dna tests da ist das fehlen von exekutivbeamten oder das nicht funktionierende abschiebesystem f r straff llig gewordene ausl nder sind hinl nglich bekannte umst nde wir konnten in den letzten zwei jahren allerdings beobachten dass dies sowohl von sp als vp nicht zur kenntnis genommen wurde
3681301 wir fordern daher einen umgehenden stopp der einsparungen und eine ad quate aufstockung der exekutive
3681302 niets de gunning van de opdracht aan het genootschap in de weg zal staan
3681303 dat er in beginsel geen belemmeringen zijn voor hervatting van de samenwerking
3681304 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt and whose background you are beginning to wonder about she has brought real results and even his words today are in doubt invented for a campaign ultimately he cannot win against john mccain
3681305 must now in earnest show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3681306 does anyone believe it is possible to win the nomination without over these two months raising all these issues against him
3681307 a nice campaign that wins the states alone that can be won will that be enough or do serious issues have to raised about him
3681308 his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3681309 we are never going to say anything about his background we have to show the value of ours when it comes to making decisions understanding the needs of most americans the invisible americans
3681310 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt
3681311 make this a new american century the american strategic energy fund lets use our logo to make some flags we can give out lets add flag symbols to the backgrounds
3681312 die vertr ge f r den euro 08 werbewunderfuzzi aus italien sind am tisch gelegen und in einer sondersitzung der generalversammlung der k rnten werbung hat die wirtschaftskammer auf das fehlende leistungsprofil in den vertr gen mit garofalo hingewiesen
3681313 haider wie bilgram haben damals erkl rt sie w rden f r garofalo die hand ins feuer legen dann sollen sie jetzt auch ihre haftung ernst nehmen und die vertrags misere pers nlich begleichen
3681314 was garofalo f r k rnten gebracht hat steht nach wie vor in den sternen auf jeden fall sind auch 60 000 euro im falle eines vergleichs dem steuerzahler nicht mehr zumutbar
3681315 jetzt sollen sie einmal selbst f r ihren murks gerade stehen die pannen der k rnten werbung auf kosten des steuerzahlers sind nicht mehr zumutbar
3681316 1999 wurden in sterreich 493 246 straftaten angezeigt die sehr gut arbeitende polizei konnte davon 51 4 kl ren im jahr 2007 mussten nun schon 594 240 kriminalf lle hingenommen werden das ist ein anstieg um 20 48 also um mehr als ein f nftel gekl rt werden konnten nur mehr 39 4 ein r ckgang um 12 f r diese fehlentwicklung gegen die die polizei in unserem land trotz gr ter bem hungen wegen des von der vp verursachten personalmangels nahezu machtlos ist tragen die vp innenminister seit 2000 die volle verantwortung ein gebot der stunde w re daher die sofortige aufnahme von mindestens 1 000 zus tzlichen polizistinnen daf r gen gt das einholen eines ja durch innenministerin fekter bei ihrem parteifreund finanzminister molterer
3681317 2007 haben in sterreich die einbr che in einfamilienh user gegen ber 2006 um extrem zugenommen in ober sterreich etwa gar um 57 7 aufkl rung erfolgt in diesen f llen kaum die raub berf lle auf passanten in der ffentlichkeit haben ebenfalls stark zugenommen beides deliktsfelder in denen verst rkte polizeipr senz hohe pr vention bewirkt mehr streifen sind aber f r die polizei nicht m glich weil die vp innenminister seit 2000 massiv die zahl der polizistinnen gek rzt haben daher brauchen wir vor ort mindestens 1 000 polizistinnen und kriminalbeamtinnen mehr unmittelbar vor ort in den st dten und gemeinden
3681318 die jahrelangen besch nigungen und tricks der vp im sicherheitsbereich m ssen ein ende haben die volkspartei und ihre innenminister haben in der kriminalit tsbek mpfung versagt und die menschen sowie die polizei mit der steigenden kriminalit t alleine gelassen die behauptete sicherheitskompetenz der vp ist schall und rauch
3681319 das versagen der au en und der innenministerin beim abschlie en internationaler abkommen zur r ckstellung von straft tern in ihre herkunftsl nder ist ein grober politischer fehler und inakzeptabel ich verlange hier von innenministerin fekter und au enministerin plassnik dass sie die entsprechenden zahlen auf den tisch legen und endlich die n tigen abkommen erwirken
3681320 die aussagen von horngacher gegen ber dem falter m ssen umgehend und umfassend gekl rt werden denn diese vorw rfe zeichnen ein sittenbild von korruption unerlaubter geschenkannahme und interventionsversuchen wie es der korruptionsuntersuchungsausschuss bereits in teilen zu tage gebracht hat
3681321 die gesamte causa wiener polizei sowie die causa horngacher selbst w ren ein eigenes beweisthema des untersuchungsausschusses gewesen wenn nicht die vp neuwahlen vom zaun gebrochen bzw die sp gemeinsam mit der vp die arbeit des ausschusses im sommer nicht abgew rgt h tte beide f rchten sich vor den erkenntnissen die der ausschuss zu tage bringt daher behindern sie die parlamentarische kontrolle die vp bezeichnet diese sogar offen als l stig und berfl ssig die sp legt nur lippenbekenntnisse zur kontrolle ab l sst sich dann aber von der vp einspannen
3681322 die fp fordert daher jetzt die wiederaufnahme der sitzungen im sommer um die vorw rfe horngachers gegen den ehemaligen kabinettschef philipp ita zu kl ren dieser soll bei horngacher interveniert haben weil er betrunken ein anhaltezeichen der polizei ignoriert hat des weiteren muss in der n chsten legislaturperiode die wiedereinsetzung des ausschusses sichergestellt werden damit die restlichen vorw rfe zur causa wiener polizei restlos gekl rt werden k nnen jetzt haben vp und vor allem sp die gelegenheit im wahlkampf zu beweisen dass sie zur parlamentarischen kontrolle stehen au erdem ist die innenministerin zum handeln aufgefordert und soll endlich daran gehen in ihrem ressort f r ordnung zu sorgen

3681324 entweder fu ball em oder olympiade ist f r einen ffentlich rechtlichen sender der gerade die grundgeb hren angehoben hat bedenklich und nicht akzeptabel will der orf wirklich dass geh rlose zuseher und zuseherinnen auf die deutschen sender wechseln
3681325 ich fordere den orf auf die teletext abteilung finanziell so auszustatten dass es keine personalm ngel mehr gibt damit k nnte auch eine wesentliche forderung die seit jahren besteht erf llt werden die parlamentsdebatten sollten untertitelt oder in geb rdensprache gedolmetscht und ausgestrahlt werden diese forderung scheiterte bisher ebenfalls am argument des personalmangels
3681326 die fp hat sich mit ihrer strikten weigerung das fairnessabkommen f r die nationalratswahl 2008 zu unterst tzen selbst enttarnt

3681329 i look at shane crawford and theres no doubt he was ready to finish a few years ago but now he just plays his part in the side but he can see theres a premiership not far away
3681330 they are things that would make you want to keep playing
3681331 i always thought you know at 28 that i had the chance to come back but the last few years theres been some trying times
3681332 but i always felt that if i didnt have another injury id get there but i sort of look back as a whole at my career and wouldnt change anything form injuries wins and losses its just been a fantastic journey since 1995
3681333 i might have said no earlier in the year but this time next year if its going like it is now id say yeah im ready to go again

3681337 die initiative im namen der eu pr sidentschaft demonstriert die st rke europas wenn es geeint auftritt es ist nun vordringlich dass die gesamte union hinter der franz sischen pr sidentschaft steht und keine privataktionen unternommen werden
3681338 weiters braucht es von seiten der eu und der schwarzmeerl nder ein gemeinsames angebot an russland zur konstruktiven zusammenarbeit nicht zuletzt im interesse einer stabilen energieversorgung europas ist ein st rkeres engagement der eu in der region jedenfalls unerl sslich
3681339 the ausvet plan is very clear on what is required to prevent any further spread of this highly fatal disease
3681340 in these cases human health and safety must come first
3681341 in the interests of protecting people and horses from further infection euthanasia is the most appropriate response
3681342 they are trying to tell us the horse is still positive
3681343 they are saying theres a 10 per cent chance it could be hidden in his system and come out at a later date
3681344 the only evidence they have for that is a different virus in india

3681370 die fp hat den verhandlungstisch verlassen daher sind die gespr che ber das fairnessabkommen geplatzt
3681371 trotzdem gab es sehr konstruktive gespr che wir haben letztlich ohne die fp einen weg der direkten kommunikation vereinbart um dennoch f r einen fairen wahlkampf zu sorgen

3681384 leider war die fp nicht bereit die selbstbeschr nkungen die ein fairness abkommen mit sich bringen mitzutragen
3681385 die sp will eine sachliche und faire wahlauseinandersetzung und sieht daher die eckpunkte des abkommens als leitfaden f r die wahlauseinadersetzung
3681386 die tatsache dass das abkommen nicht zustande gekommen ist wird die sp aber keineswegs daran hindern eine wahlauseinandersetzung zu f hren bei der die sozialdemokratie auf die besseren ideen und die besseren konzepte f r die menschen in diesem land setzt wir sind davon berzeugt dass wir diese inhalte zwar mit konsequenz und beharrlichkeit aber trotzdem sachlich und vor allem in einem respektvollen umgang mit den mitbewerbern transportieren k nnen

3681459 its like riding a bicycle its like i never left
3681460 i just wanted to go out and gauge how i feel i felt okay i just got some new stuff orthotics in my shoes and this is the first day i ran in them my feet are a little sore right now so its something i have to get used to once i get used to it andget the soreness out ill be back out here

3681462 tynes jammed his foot the other day when he was kicking
3681463 he slipped on his plant foot and came down in an awkward way hes being treated too
3681464 im surprised its been this long a day or two ago he told me that he thought today would be the day but i dont know its very frustrating it is for the player too i mean hes here for a reason and he had such great expectations unfortunately the way it works in this game he had his best practice and then thats the last time i saw him
3681465 hes a big powerful kid who is very smart he tries to take full advantage of every chance he has and when he has had to play with the ones he has done a good job hes a handy guy he plays both guard and tackle
3681466 looking at him i definitely see a special player i truly believe that he is going to be a special one having a great impact on the giants team as well as the community he is a good young man i met his parents in detroit and i can tell that he came from a solid foundation athletically kenny is without a doubt one of the best ive seen the kid has unbelievable range he can get from the middle of the field to the sideline just like that then for him to show up which i knew grading him coming out of college with his tackling ability you put that kid on turf and he is that much quicker and faster its interesting you say that because ive talked to some of my buddies around the league and they wanted to pull the trigger on him in the draft i thought he was going to gone to be honest with you im just still in awe about the fact that we actually got him its a situation we are all excited about for kenny phillips to fall to us like the way he did it was like an early christmas present he better get on the field as much as he can hes got to deal with the learning curve but hes picking it up well once he is able to minimize his mistakes by improving his technique which we constantly are trying to improve with all of our guys it will be hard to keep him off the field plaxico burress said something to me the other night he said coach man im going to be honest with you i hate seeing guys like kenny back there in the middle of the post because theyre so fast and so rangy it is very intimidating to see him back there especially because he can get from the middle of the field to the sidelines that right there coming from a guy like plaxico means a lot i havent told that to kenny yet but im sure you guys will print that now im expecting great things out of this young man

3681479 brothers i do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it but one thing i do forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead i press on toward the goal to win the prize for which god has called me heavenward in christ jesus
3681480 therefore since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses see chapter 11 for a list of encouragers let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us let us fix our eyes on jesus the author and perfecter of our faith who for the joy set before him endured the cross scorning its shame and sat down at the right hand of the throne of god consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men so that you will not grow weary and lose heart
3681481 let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us
3681482 and now compelled by the spirit i am going to jerusalem not knowing what will happen to me there i only know that in every city the holy spirit warns me that prison and hardships are facing me however i consider my life worth nothing to me if only i may finish the race and complete the task the lord jesus has given me the task of testifying to the gospel of gods grace

3681545 chris was awesome and i thought he had a great game he was just terrific
3681546 hes always been in my thoughts anyway thats why i signed him i know what he can do
3681547 from the moment i spoke to him i realised hes a proper bloke to have around the place
3681548 if you look at any of the big fellows in our league his record of 45 goals in the last three years stands up well
3681549 he creates chances for other people as well because of his physical presence

3681557 the main thing for us is to work hard on the training ground and keep the team spirit that we had last season
3681558 i think that will go a long way this year to helping us do really well in the league hopefully we can do what reading did when they went up
3681559 they had a really good season and finished seventh or eighth if we can do that it would be a fantastic achievement

3681567 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible secretary of labor
3681568 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3681569 he was the first person since lyndon johnson to address it in a meaningful way

3681614 i cant believe westover hills is allowing this ugly thing to go in
3681615 evidentemente no es una cuesti n de que la gente que ya tiene sobrepeso se vuelva torpe porque la mayor a de esos ni os no eran m s gordos que sus compa eros

3681617 i cannot do these things alone so i am urging you all to join me in this campaign for our children i need the help of young and old i need the help of you who are empty nesters and have already raised your children i need the help of you who are young and do not yet have children i need the help of you who are financially well off and you who are struggling financially i need the help of african americans caucasians and hispanics
3681618 hey what dyou think happens when you drive a concrete truck onto a bridge with an eight ton weight limit on it
3681619 i have great respect for the work that your members have done i only wish that they had invested as much time and energy into working to fix our public schools
3681620 just how rotten are the d c public schools in a recent survey by education week the d c public schools ranked fourth from the bottom in terms of graduation rates test scores for basics like math and reading are also near the bottom its not for lack of money a recent u s census bureau report says the district school spending clocks in at more than 13 400 per child third highest in the nation it takes a lot of money to run a school system as lousy as d c s
3681621 ill mop the floor with you and im not scared of your parents ill mop the floor up with them too
3681622 how will any charter school reach out to the african american and latino parents to make sure that they understand that this school is for all
3681623 will a charter school make decisions about expelling children with low grades
3681624 what about a parent or grandparent who would like their child to go to the school but doesnt know the system well enough to know the application process
3681625 if in the future another group applies for a charter and they have a good enough vision and have done as good a job in preparation i will certainly consider the application on its merits
3681626 this charter is an equal city wide open enrollment lottery the wealthy are not chosen over the poor the poor in the charter school will not be treated differently they will receive the same opportunities
3681627 so while the wealthy might not be chosen over the poor to attend this school they will have a great advantage over poor and working class families when considering their options single parent households or parents working multiple jobs will most likely not be able to drive their children to and from school every day
3681628 if you cant take the heat then stay out of the race for school board
3681629 when i try to change minds by definition that means i think i am right
3681630 it is not possible to resolve these issues outside the context of the status
3681631 that president sarkozy agreed and obliged tbilisi to support doesnt directly mention the question of status
3681632 upon the withdrawal of georgian troops to their barracks russian troops will return to the territory of the russian federation
3681633 his anti war posture might be attractive to obama but hes anathema to much of the progressive base of the democratic party
3681634 i think though it is impossible to predict with absolute confidence that the delegates would not deliver their votes unless at a minimum he switched political parties
3681635 hes not a good man when it comes to everything else and he hasnt voted well in any way shape or form that would gain any support from me or any other thinking democrat
3681636 hagel couldnt keep his mouth shut long enough to be somebodys no 2
3681637 its tough to be someones no 2 when youre used to making your own decisions
3681638 its just not responsible to be saying things like that

3681647 i dont think ill be ready to race on the track again this year i will just have to focus upon the cross country season this winter
3681648 i went into this not even ranked in the top 10 so to finish sixth is pretty good ive done a personal best time in my main event
3681649 the other countries out there were very very fast and we gave them a good fight
3681650 it wasnt the result we were looking for but we have just got to keep our heads up and keep our eyes on the target
3681651 the nice thing about seeing fred bat at six is that it gives us balance and lets us put out the attack we put out in the last test
3681652 watching the bowling attack with the four seamers it gave us lots of options to maintain pressure for longer and thats really promising
3681653 when were looking at the side for india which may have two spinners we need to get the balance right between getting runs and taking wickets
3681654 little prospect of offering their residents the standard of living to which they aspire
3681655 realistic about the ability of cities such as manchester leeds and newcastle to regenerate struggling nearby towns such as liverpool bradford and sunderland
3681656 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position regeneration in the sense of convergence will not happen because it is not possible
3681657 having a users base doesnt necessarily mean you have a community
3681658 if you can get a community going then you know you are on the right track
3681659 with the amount of passion they have what theyre willing to do for you the lengths theyre willing to go to try to make something work
3681660 youd have to have an entire quality assurance department for that kind of stuff or massive amounts of developers hours to solve some of those things
3681661 if you listen to them if you try to help them solve a problem or get them up and running they become passionate and as soon as they become passionate they help evangelize for you the word of mouth of your friends is the most powerful influence there is its fantastic
3681662 its really effective for connecting with people whether they have a question just want to tell us something or have a problem
3681663 try them out see if people are migrating there and see if they want to talk to you there if thats where people are going to hang out then thats where you need to be
3681664 twitter is easy for someone to ask me a quick question or mention a problem then it migrates to a different format it either goes into get satisfaction where it is officially logged or someone may have a longer question so they email me or we start up an instant messenger chat that combination of tools is how things realy end up working its important to be on a variety of platforms its also important to be flexible to move between them to whichever format of communication is most comfortable for people
3681665 i have been stepping it up every time it was a step up again today i had to do the sprint finish but it was brilliant

3681681 we think that this mix of terrorism illegal migration trafficking in persons trafficking in drugs its becoming real dangerous
3681682 and the big danger is that the money of drugs and human trafficking will be poured into the terrorism movements
3681683 the much vaunted process of moroccan reform has taken a step back
3681684 we could mention the casablanca riots in 1965 or in 1981 or the events in fes in 1990 in our collective consciousness there are many bad memories of demonstrations and general strikes

3681687 last week todd shared with me that his wife had returned to canada and hes following her this week ive been assured by his people that there is no third party involved
3681688 a large segment of the movement has been skeptical from day one theyre going to see this as a natural progression others who have been following todd are going to be spiritually shipwrecked weve most definitely seen through this revival a lot of people are not grounded in scripture so for them it wont be an issue
3681689 undoubtedly the pressures and the burden of the outpouring which approaches 144 days on august 23rd have helped to create an atmosphere of fatigue and stress that has exacerbated existing issues in their relationship
3681690 unfortunately today people are looking for god in all the wrong places
3681691 theyre going to hear in lakeland all kinds of things from people being resurrected from the dead not true no details no descriptions to supposedly people being pickled and marinated in the spirit in fact theyre going to hear about vibrating in the spirit now this guy is an absolute phony unfortunately people are falling for his ruse
3681692 when you say god did something he didnt do or the holy spirit told you something he didnt tell you thats blasphemous
3681693 every few years here comes another fraudulent scandal riddled faith healer
3681694 thats sadly no surprise i am not dubious about healing i believe that god heals today we all know however that there are those who will use the power of god to peddle a product
3681695 whats most tragic about this cycle though is the fact that theres always a constituency for guys like this i fear that its more than just p t barnums famous old maxim about the gullibility of the american public i fear that theres something missing in our churches that drives even some of our people to charlatans might there be less of a demand for these traveling health and wealth revivalists if our churches spent more time on our knees in prayer for sick and hurting people

3681701 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3681702 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3681703 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3681704 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3681705 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3681706 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3681707 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3681708 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3681709 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3681710 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3681711 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3681712 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3681713 i spent my allowance on two humphrey buttons and pinned them to the curtain in my bedroom when i got home
3681714 i saw a william mckinley button president from 1897 to 1901 for 50 cents and i managed to talk the guy down to 25 cents when i went home and consulted my book on political buttons value i discovered it was worth a whole dollar
3681715 three years ago i advertised for the truman button in the independence missouri newspaper
3681716 thats where truman began his career i got no response then just two weeks ago i got a call a woman who owned the button had died and her children had found my ad clipping in the drawer where she had left it

3681736 negeri yang kami lalui untuk diintai itu adalah luar biasa baiknya 14 8 jika tuhan berkenan kepada kita maka ia akan membawa kita masuk ke negeri itu dan akan memberikannya kepada kita suatu negeri yang berlimpah limpah susu dan madunya 14 9 hanya janganlah memberontak kepada tuhan dan janganlah takut kepada bangsa negeri itu sebab mereka akan kita telan habis yang melindungi mereka sudah meninggalkan mereka sedang tuhan menyertai kita janganlah takut kepada mereka

3681748 its fairly clear that the labour market is deteriorating at a rapid pace and i think its going to continue to do so because of slower economic growth and concerns by companies that the downturn might actually be longer and more pronounced than they originally thought
3681749 with rpi inflation reaching 5 in july an acceleration in pay growth cannot be ruled out and even if it stays subdued the mpc has plenty of other inflation concerns which are likely to keep rates on hold for another couple of months at least

3681881 with the growing impact of websites mobiles and many other multi media forms the matchday programme is no longer a necessary purchase for football fans
3681882 in years gone by you would buy the programme to see who was in the team but these days that is not the case
3681883 we looked very closely at this and decided we needed to do something about it
3681884 we worked with our printers mercer print uk ltd and they told us about nine lives paper which seemed to fit perfectly with what we wanted to achieve it gives the new programme a different feel and style but one we hope supporters like
3681885 we have heard a lot about the credit crunch and the people of preston just like the rest of the country will have less spare cash in their pockets with rising living costs
3681886 we want people to be able to enjoy the full matchday experience and this year we have held matchday prices and lowered the cost of the programme so hopefully these two things along with the performance of alan irvines side will make people want to be a part of the new season

3681911 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3681912 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3681913 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3681914 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3681915 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3681916 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3681917 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3681918 the swp was for many years the leading voice of trotskyism in the usa
3681919 since the 1980s the swp has drifted away from trotskyism and moved towards the brand of authoritarian politics espoused by cuban leader fidel castros style of marxism
3681920 one of the most challenging retail environments in its 41 year history
3681921 ortak is bucking all trends when it comes to retail growth with every high street sector recording tougher times as the credit crunch bites
3681922 the thai economy got off to a scintillating start in 2008 with first quarter growth up six per cent on the same period last year and up 5 7 on the last quarter of 2007 after two years of political turmoil culminating in a coup last year it seems the new government is finally settling in and has made economic growth its top priority the main thrust of its efforts is centred on generating internal and regional investment with global investment currently slowing
3681923 the local real estate market has experienced an overall slowdown in response to numerous political and economic pressures the number of transactions registered at the chiang mai land office declined from 15 000 in 2005 to 10 000 in 2006 and 9 800 last year but in the middle and upper tiers where around 20 projects are under way sales remained strong major developers are moving forward with numerous residential projects in and around chiang mai
3681924 virtually all of these property buyers have seen their investment increase in value capital appreciation over the past four years has varied from 15 to 20 per cent per annum although some properties have seen the value of their asset rise by as much as 50 or 100 per cent between the launch of a project and the transfer of title
3681925 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3681926 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3681927 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3681928 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3681929 you need to record something like this because its not everyday you find something that looks like this running around out in the middle of the county
3681930 you know its just kind of one of those things to hear about and talk about but to actually see something on video that may actually be a live one thats pretty amazing
3681931 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3681932 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3681933 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3681934 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3681935 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3681936 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3681937 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3681938 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3681939 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3681940 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odours the university of liverpools dr craig roberts who led the study said not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems it could also ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odour perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners being on the pill simulates a state of pregnancy which may reverse a womans reaction to male odours
3681941 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3681942 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3681943 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3681944 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3681945 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3681946 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3681947 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3681948 who are open to doing something on the production side
3681949 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3681950 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3681951 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3681952 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3681953 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3681954 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3681955 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3681956 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3681957 he was a brave soldier who made the greatest sacrifice anyone could make for everyone elses freedom
3681958 he realized that by being over there he was going to make a difference in the lives of those people
3681959 he always looked out for the other guy never thought of himself he volunteered to go to c co before our first deployment so that one of the guys from our platoon didnt have to deploy early and would have a chance to marry his fiance thats koch for you always looking out for his buddies
3681960 he had no problem he was dedicated to the fact that people over there needed help he was always concerned about other people he loved children he was a nice soft hearted kid
3681961 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3681962 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3681963 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3681964 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3681965 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3681966 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3681967 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3681968 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3681969 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3681970 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3681971 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3681972 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3681973 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3681974 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3681975 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3681976 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3681977 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3681978 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3681979 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3681980 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3681981 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3681982 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3681983 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3681984 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3681985 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3681986 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3681987 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3681988 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3681989 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3681990 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3681991 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

3681999 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3682000 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3682001 it will take much more than 50km to realise what i did
3682002 il successo a tutti i costi se non ho ancora fatto un figlio perch ho solo 23 anni e volevo prima realizzarmi soprattutto come donna adesso sono serena e anche se dopo lisola dei famosi mi dovessero arrivare proposte interessanti vorrei mettere in cantiere un bambino entro un anno mi piacerebbe essere una mamma giovane
3682003 ho accettato di partecipare perch credo sia lunico reality valido il solo che ti consente di metterti davvero alla prova tra mille difficolt avevo gi dichiarato pi volte che mi sarebbe piaciuto fare la naufraga anche se quando arrivata la proposta per un attimo ho tremato

3682005 theres an erotic undercurrent about being in control of a situation
3682006 for most of my friends its sort of a domination thing
3682007 its basically getting someone in a position where theyre most vulnerable my friends enjoy that and they tell their friends they did it but its not like girls are ready for something they do when theyre really drunk
3682008 theres an erotic undercurrent about being in control of a situation
3682009 its a myth that every straight man wants it and the women who give it up do just that
3682010 i think it is a decision of the group of the directors together they are to achieve the most theatrical effect for the benefit of the whole performance the whole opening ceremony
3682011 i do not see there is anything wrong with it
3682012 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3682013 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3682014 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3682015 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3682016 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3682017 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

3682019 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3682020 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

3682025 darker than usual themes that have implications for the way we live now
3682026 goes darker and deeper than any hollywood movie of its comic book kind
3682027 a dark and highly complex drama with more brains than any other movie this summer
3682028 will never appeal to people who are happy with art only when it has as little bite as possible
3682029 what we do keeps the world from falling into chaos
3682030 i try to show the schemers how pathetic their attempts to control things really are
3682031 technically x 4 is then practically obsolete amp panther amp jaguar are then obsolete
3682032 dont come here if you dont have the very latest software loaded
3682033 aside i dont think it has been more than 2 5 years since fce 3 was replaced by 3 5 amp 4 0 it was an annual upgrade for awhile there
3682034 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3682035 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3682036 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3682037 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3682038 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3682039 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3682040 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3682041 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

3682061 it is one of my fastest times in the past couple of years so i take a lot of confidence going into the final

3682066 that way the cost of many of these supplies will not come out of their own pockets
3682067 being an assistant state attorney i have thousands of hours in the courtroom
3682068 that was my biggest learning experience in judging the credibility of witnesses
3682069 i had three kids by the time i was 21 years old and i didnt have good parenting skills
3682070 i had to learn to be patient i had to look at the evidence and determine the credibility of the witness i was their judge their jury their prosecutor their defender their mediator

3682075 i believe my diverse legal experience in handling many types of matters certainly qualifies me best
3682076 id like to see us wait a year with the understanding that in a year we have to do something i cant see doing this much this year
3682077 i agree with the amount because we are going to have to build the public works complex but there is no reason we cant stair step this to more gentle
3682078 im torn with this and my fear is if we dont start now and we do it next year we are already behind we had to take 270 000 out of the general fund to balance the budget for 2008 2009

3682096 the next year will be a difficult one with inflation high and broadly flat but with monetary policy focused on its task of bringing inflation back to the target we will come through the adjustment
3682097 the tone is clearly dovish with the economy now expected broadly to stagnate over the next year or so

3682115 i was held in a restaurant and physically and forcibly restrained there
3682116 i tried to explain to these people that i was a journalist but they dragged me out and slung me in in the back of a police van and held me there for another few minutes
3682117 nobody punched me but they were very forceful and i have a cut knee and a bruise on my finger
3682118 they basically dragged me into the restaurant and then out and took my shoes off me
3682119 i was able to eventually show them my journalist credentials and they realised i was a british journalist and the next time the door of the van opened i was able to walk out
3682120 they did ask me in english what my views were on tibet and i said i dont have any views im a journalist
3682121 i was there purely to report on a protest and took no part in the protest itself
3682122 we then contacted the british embassy and they are taking it up at consular level
3682123 we are aware of the incident and have spoken directly to john ray
3682124 we have expressed our strong concern to the chinese authorities and we are pleased that he has been released

3682127 i was flat out told that this is how the iphone behaves and nothing is wrong every time it changes wifi networks it has to establish its email port 25 over and over again and so it will not connect to the next network it finds until you restart your iphone
3682128 where were you sent you an email you missed the meeting
3682129 in the 14 days since we launched its been a rocky road and we know the pain some people have been suffering
3682130 be assured people here are working 24 7 to improve matters and were going to favor getting you new info hot off the presses even if we have to post corrections or further updates later
3682131 the team has also fixed over 70 bugs including one that was preventing mobileme imap mail folders from syncing correctly between the web app and mac os x mail or outlook

3682133 delete and restore replace mail accounts from known working accounts on your computer via itunes
3682134 team the launch of mobileme was not our finest hour there are several things we could have done better mobileme was simply not up to apples standards it clearly needed more time and testing rather than launch mobileme as a monolithic service we could have launched over the air syncing with iphone to begin with followed by the web applications one by one mail first followed 30 days later if things went well with mail by calendar then 30 days later by contacts it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence we are taking many steps to learn from this experience so that we can grow mobileme into a service that our customers will love one step that i can share with you today is that the mobileme team will now report to eddy cue who will lead all of our internet services itunes the app store and starting today mobileme eddys new title will be vice president internet services and he will now report directly to me yes i have had many many issues since upgrading my gen1 4gb phone to 2 0 email does not download properly from my pop3 server several accounts message previews dont show up consistently selecting a message from inbox results in endless spinning status indicator s very often and no message body showing up even after several minutes of spinning status indicator and no errors indicated either the emails have no attachments in most cases and are 1 2 pages so maybe 4 8k max in size networking in general seems to have been tanked by 2 0 the range of the wi fi seems less and the cellphone signal seems weaker than it was in the past fewer bars in general the edge egprs network access seems much slower too which is hard to do this release really seems to be a huge pos thats been my experience apple over i am so upset since i expected the normal apple quality and got ms quality instead oh to the apple zealots i dont want to see a single reply to this about how your phone was upgraded offline and works great or any of that crap i upgraded the phone with itunes online just like all the other updates if there was a better undocumented preference for upgrading the phone offline and this obscure method was the result of some de developing the upgrade process by doing offline upgrades during regression testing that from a software consistency qa and ease of use standpoint is incredibly lame and nothing but shear incompetence they should go work for ms to think someone will second guess the online update vs offline method is ludicrous and extremely bone headed the upgrade should work identically regardless of method used clear on that one zealots i do know what software development is difficult particularly when looking for bugs and trying to fix things but i agree that apple definitely dropped the ball on this one just like how steve jobs sent an email out to his employees about waiting for the introduction of mobileme well they should had made absolutely sure and positive that the 2 0 update was working stable none of that clunky lagging scrolling text messaging contact scrolling broken email lost weak signal etc etc crap oh well i too know how difficult design engineering can be since i worked at another unix platform company for 8 years doing design engineering and program management a really bright company i know how the process works and i know how the marketing pucks will push p1s1s out the door despite being out voted in the pm release meetings i hate to see apple do it to themselves again they changed the industry with the iphone just look at all the korean amp japanese knock offs coming out almost every month since july 2007 i would hate to see a replay of the 80s when arrogance in marketing resulted in a lost opportunity and 150b in billy gs pockets i spent 15 years in the valley from 1985 to 2000 i used to see wozniak at the original pancake house in saratoga nearly every saturday or sunday in the late 80s early 90s they apple have had mobile phones on their minds for quite sometime because back in 1990 wozniak had a home made wrist watch based cellphone he used a timex calculator watch or similar for the keypad and display had an earpiece and the guts of the phone on his belt in a 4x4x2

3682186 its entirely possible that attorneys are not giving adequate advice
3682187 its peculiar if any field is not improving its performance over a 40 year period
3682188 c ritics of the profession have long argued that lawyers have an incentive to try to collect fees that are contingent on winning in court or simply to bill for all the hours required to prepare and go to trial

3682193 npp has done enough to deserve the mandate of the people again lets remain focused and campaign vigorously to make the electorate understand the need not to vote to return the ndc to power we are moving forward no turning back
3682194 we do not want nana akufo addo and others to be under the illusion that women of this great party of ours do not support the choice of a woman as a running mate we are here to put to rest the negative propaganda that women of the npp do not support the idea of a female running mate
3682195 if a country like pakistan with a conservative muslim population could elect a woman as prime minister what prevents us from doing a similar thing
3682196 the elders and national executive members should allow nana akufo addo a free hand to choose someone he can comfortably work with if nana akufo addo feels strongly about the credentials and candidature of a party member so be it if the party imposes a candidate on the flag bearer and a conflict arises whom are we going to blame

3682216 the material had languished unheard for 30 years until it was passed to manchester universitys school of art histories and culture to catalogue and preserve the material in poor condition had to be played on a 1960s studer a80 tape machine lent by the bbcs manchester studios before it could be digitised

3682219 my most beautiful sound at the time was a tatty green bbc lampshade

3682251 no zoning ordinance or by law shall regulate or restrict the interior area of a single family residential building provided however that such structures may be subject to reasonable regulations concerning the bulk and height of structures and determining yard sizes lot area setbacks open space parking and building coverage requirements
3682252 the regulation of the bulk of a building by considering its internal area as through the use of a floor to area ratio is a generally recognized and accepted principle of zoning
3682253 and intended regulation by bulk to include consideration of internal area
3682254 would deprive the town of all ability to regulate density of population and intensity of use created by single family homes
3682255 strip municipalities of the ability to achieve the purposes of zoning
3682256 its rare in the parched landscape of the immigration debate to come across policies that are simple realistic and humane but here is one the los angeles city council is expected to vote on wednesday on an ordinance requiring big box home improvement stores to protect order and safety when day laborers gather in their parking lots looking for work
3682257 opposition has erupted from the usual camps not all day laborers are undocumented immigrants or even immigrants but a lot of them are and the thought of doing anything that would make their lives easier makes some
3682258 like any land use law governing things like parking lot lighting curbs and sidewalks the ordinance treats milling crowds of laborers and idling trucks as an integral fact of home depots business that should be managed before it becomes chaotic and hazardous the solution is basic prevention and could be as simple as setting up an area somewhere on store property with shade toilets drinking water and trash cans

3682273 good politicians like good scientists draw conclusions from facts bad politicians like bad scientists draw facts from conclusions
3682274 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3682275 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children
3682276 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron
3682277 good politicians like good scientists draw conclusions from facts bad politicians like bad scientists draw facts from conclusions
3682278 of all the forms of inequality injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane
3682279 that every american man woman and child be guaranteed to have affordable comprehensive health care
3682280 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children
3682281 what you have not right to tell me how to live my life
3682282 but they are not they dont know who is the president of georgia i am sure
3682283 because they have family back there and my first thought was supporting them its special because i feel more georgian now
3682284 it was a very hard time we had a lot of pressure to be here im very proud today not only because it was against russia because we play well out there we won this match and we are still in the competition
3682285 it is bad sport for them to say we are one team
3682286 it seems it is on their minds all the victims in georgia so it is very hard to compete here
3682287 even for me as the president and leader of my team i have slept two three four hours since the war started in georgia
3682288 i do not want to hear the comments from the russian athletes any more its important that georgia goes to the next round and russia goes home
3682289 i thought of you when i saw this just a reminder that you are still in my heart
3682290 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron

3682292 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children
3682293 did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us on the road and while he opened the scriptures to us
3682294 we ought to obey god rather than men the god of our fathers raised up jesus whom you murdered by hanging on a tree him god has exalted to his right hand to be prince and savior to give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins and we are his witnesses to these things and so also is the holy spirit whom god has given to those who obey him
3682295 you want to know what can happen this is what happens

3682297 what i tell you in darkness that speak ye in light and what ye hear in the ear that preach ye upon the housetops
3682298 in colloquial language people living in ethnically diverse settings appear to hunker down that is to pull in like a turtle
3682299 to withdraw even from close friends to expect the worst from their community and its leaders to volunteer less give less to charity and work on community projects less often to register to vote less to agitate for social reform more but have less faith that they can actually make a difference and to huddle unhappily in front of the television
3682300 may underestimate the real effect of diversity on social withdrawal
3682301 the last hope of human liberty in this world rests on us we ought for so dear a stake to sacrifice every attachment amp every enmity
3682302 he fears that his work on the surprisingly negative effects of diversity will become part of the immigration debate even though he finds that in the long run people do forge new communities and new ties
3682303 the problem isnt ethnic conflict or troubled racial relations but withdrawal and isolation
3682304 in colloquial language people living in ethnically diverse settings appear to hunker down that is to pull in like a turtle
3682305 from the threat of ddt to the threat of heterosexual aids in america to that mass killer secondhand smoke the left believes and spreads threats that unlike the threat of islamic terror really are
3682306 you arent good enough to make it on your own
3682307 if my neighbor is rich i am not hurt by his comfort and ease on the contrary he buys from my store or my trade
3682308 the church is made up mostly of people coming out of the secular lifestyle
3682309 but the divorce rate of those raised in the church is much lower than their secularist counterparts
3682310 also capital punishment is not the same as murder so if you are referring to christians support of the death penalty you are opening a can of worms that has been dealt with on an earlier article
3682311 or any of the above have been anti other religion but that doesnt mean i want their rights taken away in our free society
3682312 do we need to toss the muslims out of the country whether born here or not whether a fresh convert or an import
3682313 no we want knowledgeable committed to peace reformers or we want them to convert from islam islam requires that its followers do not question islam but just follow its edicts
3682314 thats true but that is what secularists and leftist groups do far more than christian groups again see my profile
3682315 they are hardly comparable male circumcision does not attempt to interfere with the enjoyment of sex as does female circumcision
3682316 good intentions that end in harmful results are not ok with god
3682317 why think about what ive said read my profile study a little bit on what it is the christian is trying to follow rather than what the world assumes the christian is trying to follow youve heard just enough of the bible to be inoculated against it
3682318 to some of us other countries that like liberty the constraints of the litigious society youve created are anathema to liberty as are the colour and drug use issues and crime levels
3682319 under their rule from 1757 to 1857 indian per capita income fell but british gains were substantial
3682320 youve heard just enough of the bible to be inoculated against it
3682321 the looking up of links to sites that agree with your particular opinion and then citing them to shore up generally shaky reasoning while saying
3682322 youve heard just enough of the bible to be inoculated against it
3682323 can the left defend their political stances from their theology or are they buying the no consequence faith and applying god to it
3682324 the intent for the boy is not harm or reduction of pleasure as it is for the girl
3682325 yes it does one of the driving reasons that it became so popular in the west was that it was supposed to reduce masturbation how would it achieve this i wonder
3682326 which of these has set out in this or the last century to free another people from a despot
3682327 which one of these countries has rebuilt a nation theyve defeated and set the indigenous people up to run their own government while they backed out of controlling interest
3682328 we have to give doctors the option of whether women should be allowed to practice medicine
3682329 why did they let it keep happening why didnt they say anything
3682330 working time is not the only reason for wage disparity indeed men at the start of their working lives earn on average 8 5 more than equally qualified women entering the labour market in the same sector size of company and comparable region the only really positive point to emerge from the study is that this gap has narrowed compared with the situation facing the cohorts entering the labour market in the 1970s then 10 3 increased levels of qualifications among women have undoubtedly played a role in bridging the gap wage disparities do not by any means disappear as men and women advance in their careers the authors of the study find that wage gaps between men and women widen five years after individuals enter the labour market overall across the generations studied five years into their careers men were earning an average of 26 more than their female counterparts this increase in wage disparity as careers progress is undoubtedly essentially linked to differences in employment behaviour between men and women the study points out that male female employment patterns have a major effect on wage disparities five years into their careers there are 10 more men in employment than women irrespective of the particular generation studied differences in terms of career opportunities and access to positions of responsibility must also be factored in to the equation
3682331 where are the government funded programs to research and fix this disparity if this information was reversed their would be media blitz outrage and congressional hearings etc
3682332 more and more women are taking on the model roles men used to fill in childrens lives this means more and more the issues being poured onto kids is from women
3682333 with the feminist movement even the definitions have been moved so that it is generally accepted that unwanted advances are now defined as sexual harassment
3682334 okay so we can probably agree that this is going too far but the climate that makes such a claim possible is indication of the fact that feminism itself has gone too far
3682335 there is no publicly funded program or place that gives boys and men the clear definition of what healthy sexual aggression looks like and left to women it becomes any sexual advance unless they approved of it in that instance is defined as abusive
3682336 more and more women are taking on the model roles men used to fill
3682337 are their more male victimizers of course so why arent we dealing with the roots which come from both parents and both sexes
3682338 okay so we can probably agree that this is going too far but the climate that makes such a claim possible is indication of the fact that feminism itself has gone too far
3682339 with the feminist movement even the definitions have been moved so that it is generally accepted that unwanted advances are now defined as sexual harassment
3682340 left to women it becomes any sexual advance unless they approved of it in that instance is defined as abusive
3682341 unless there is a healthy male role model to give guidance that will often be rejected by many of the loudest feminists there is no hope for a boy to grow up with a clear understanding of how to behave appropriately and how to channel all that aggression into positive outlets
3682342 the military is one of the last bastions of positive outlets to physical aggression but the sexual harassment training they receive is just as bad if not worse than what we are given in school
3682343 nobody not government not churches not schools and more and more not even parents are able or willing to give clear direction in this specific area
3682344 it is headed by feminist ideology which is giving no healthy conclusions to them
3682345 loving emotion is important nobody denies that but the feminization of our culture has resulted in the harm of our culture
3682346 and that the general rejection of masculine influence on society is harming the entire country thats why we will abolish peanuts in a school lunch menu for the sake of one child
3682347 there is a terrible lack of personal responsibility and a glaring absence of the sense of personal sacrifice for the majority
3682348 is it intuitive to masturbate against an unwilling woman in a supply closet
3682349 is it intuitive that 75 of girls between the ages of 2 18 and 50 of boys are reported to be molested
3682350 healthy sexual aggression is informed acceptable means of sexual expression rather than the current barrage of criticism and condemnation of their aggressive sexual nature
3682351 husbands love your wives just as christ loved the church and gave himself up for her
3682352 so husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies he who loves his own wife loves himself
3682353 that older women may encourage the young women to love their own husbands
3682354 a woman may slap her man punch him in the arm or throw a drink in his face but she is much less likely in most cases physically unable to beat him to a bloody pulp break his bones or throttle him around the neck
3682355 with the feminist movement even the definitions have been moved so that it is generally accepted that unwanted advances are now defined as sexual harassment
3682356 beanie i have been harassed on the job by a female boss she tried to make it a requirement for me to flirt with her and tried to fire me for not participating
3682357 i mean according to feminists men are animalistic and there is no appropriate sexual aggression it is the voice of feminism driving sex ed in schools sexual harassment training in the work place and the very language and definitions we use to describe sexual behavior in scholastic settings

3682448 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3682449 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3682450 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

3682457 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3682458 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3682469 a lot of people were offended but i decided not to delete the comment
3682470 my policy is i do delete comments where the commenter is intending to be offensive but i dont delete comments where the commenters primary intention is to be witty even if what they say ends up offending people
3682471 ive deleted all the comments on here relating to sex with people who have downs syndrome
3682472 although google havent informed me exactly which post on this blog caused the activation of their hate crimes division the strength of feeling in the comments section here leads me to believe it was this one
3682473 standing by my rationale for not deleting the comment at first
3682474 ive been very happy with the service google provide so i will be sticking with them
3682475 their blogger software is amazing and its free i will just have to accept that when i am in my blog i am not in my own house i am a tenant there google are the true owners

3682481 seek to explore the wounds of divorce and single parenthood
3682482 its been extremely hot and that probably played a part when trying to make weight these kids sometimes cut corners
3682483 i think that under terrible western pressure especially american pressure and i think french president nicolas sarkozy has to also take credit the russians understood that they went too far
3682484 maximum program was to overthrow georgian president mikheil saakashvili and surround tbilisi
3682485 minimum program is to save face so they are saving face now by saying that all goals of the operation have been achieved
3682486 we are not making it a condition for ceasing the current stage of military operations
3682487 but for the personal information of us leaders our position is that mr saakashvili can no longer be our partner and it would be best for him to go
3682488 would have meant an open conflict with the west and russia doesnt need this
3682489 there is no rational reason for russian forces to go to tbilisi
3682490 for what purpose would the russian army go to tbilisi to conquer georgia it is completely obvious that this would be stupid because the georgians are in an anti russian mood
3682491 now it is necessary to implement the ceasefire and to draw a quick timetable so that everyone goes back to the positions they held before the conflict
3682492 the current shortfall is mainly due to the fact that several new plants are yet to be completed and some others are under maintenance
3682493 surat is a huge city but considering all the bombs were planted in areas where the diamond industry is based i think there is a message in that
3682494 the bombs in surat were planted by those who wanted to hurt india economically
3682495 stopping production for one day in the diamond industry means a loss of us 28 million
3682496 with monitoring of implementation of these recommendations weak it is unlikely that workers in small units will get more than a 15 hike
3682497 it might not make much of difference to israeli or antwerp diamantaires who have factories in africa as they are looking at similar costs back home but for indian diamantaires who have the cheap labor option that surat and other towns in gujarat provide shifting processing units to africa doesnt make economic sense
3682498 this is a sad day for me and for the country on one hand we have the most terrible murderer on the other hand we have our commitment to our boys who were sent to fight for their country it is our moral duty and our heartfelt wish to see them come back
3682499 see this hand only this hand can sign peace with the israelis
3682500 to be very careful and sensitive these days the russians are selling many arms to iran and syria and there is no need to offer them an excuse to sell even more advanced weapons
3682501 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
3682502 oh hell that irritating mogambo idiot imi is off on a real tirade lets go get something to eat and drink and we wont give him any hahaha
3682503 in rome 277 bc the denarius was born it was a silver coin and for the first 250 years its silver content declined only modestly the modest decline corresponded with romes rise to become an empire from the original 66 grains of silver the value had only declined 10 to 60 grains by the time of julius caesar 49 bc but soon afterwards monetary tumult commenced in earnest
3682504 in 54 ad emperor nero started to inflate and debase the value of romes money nero took 14 3 of the silver out of the denarius coin and 11 of the gold out of the aureus coin replacing the precious metals with base metals
3682505 as rome continued on its moral political and monetary decline by 193 ad the denarius had only 26 grains of silver a 61 devaluation from the original 66 grains shortly thereafter romes denarius stopped being accepted in trade by the rest of the world by 268 the denarius was nothing but base metal with a thin silver coating
3682506 if we flash forward to the us in the 1960s we find that in one fell swoop all of the silver was taken out of our coins and replaced with base metals are we rome on steroids
3682507 the issue right now is to put together a verification protocol for the north korean declaration
3682508 i think bush believes what condi is telling him that theyre going to persuade the north to give up nuclear weapons
3682509 i dont think thats going to happen i think weve been taken to the cleaners
3682510 rumors traveled quickly across the internet that these party backed monitors received 50 mao or roughly seven us cents for each positive post they made
3682511 from yesterday 200 netizens from across the country have become our citys first group of specially appointed web supervisors from now on the content of all websites in our city will be subject to special supervision from all social sectors and bloggers from across the country whenever there appears some uncivilized content special supervisors will quickly report it to the beijing association of online media
3682512 the public relations department of jiaozuo public security bureau immediately organized 120 of its appointed web commentators to post on the internet explaining what really happened
3682513 it is easy to identify who are members of the five mao party
3682514 when they become dominant in an online chat room i simply switch to another even if you want to make a point you dont need to use so many people to repeat it
3682515 if the government could release information promptly why does it need the help of the five mao party to spread it on the internet which could simply be taken as online rumors
3682516 like in the wengan case how come it took four days for the government to prepare a press conference
3682517 a nation has no permanent enemies and no permanent friends only permanent interests
3682518 iran cannot attack israel because of the weight of history that puts iran on the side of defenders of jewish rights to a homeland and by the same token israel cannot attack iran because first it would be acting against its own conscience and second it would be making a strategic error by weakening the non arab bloc in the middle east
3682519 the iran contra affair when israel replenished irans inventory of arms during the iran iraq war in the 1980s happened for a reason it showed realpolitik instead of ideological noise ruling the policy makers in tehran and tel aviv and the logic of limited cooperation call it a temporary marriage of convenience back then is not entirely absent today with the threats of terrorism etc
3682520 but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward
3682521 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3682522 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3682523 right now world vision needs financial resources were buying soaps were buying mattresses the most basic needs that they have
3682524 it should have been predictable to him that the russian response would be overwhelming force
3682525 theres not very much anyone in the west can or is willing to do to take on the russian military over a place called south ossetia
3682526 something like this the current conflict could propel the world towards world war three
3682527 the worlds longest most expensive pipeline runs right through georgia
3682528 any disruptions to that supply would of course have an effect on already very high prices

3682531 thats what the russians were trying to say forget the notion that georgia is a safe transit point
3682532 but whos going to invest 10 billion in the nabucco pipeline when the russians can shut it off whenever they want
3682533 but to say it had nothing at all to do with oil is ridiculous

3682548 all the players were at wembley the whole squad were there
3682549 it lets everyone know that we are all together it is a big season ahead of us and we want to do well
3682550 i would be happy with more players available but you cannot do anything about it
3682551 it was the same last season we had the frustration of wayne rooney injured in the first match ronaldo was sent off at portsmouth and missed three games hargreaves wasnt fit and carlos tevez and anderson werent 100 per cent fit it wasnt until october that we started to get the machine going
3682552 hopefully we can get it going a lot earlier this time
3682553 it is about the squad and not just the xi
3682554 it is a collective thing when everyone is back we will have a very very strong squad we will be pulling in the right direction to have a successful season again
3682555 we have progressed and got better through pre season thats what you want
3682556 goalscoring wise it is still early days and we are creating chances we have the lads who can stick them away you would like to be winning quite comfortably in pre season but hopefully we will start banging them in

3682559 at best these petition gatherers were uninformed at worst they were careless and misleading
3682560 regardless their actions are unacceptable and do not serve the best interests of the electorate
3682561 so what would this do to the 391 percent apr
3682562 this is going to regulate it to a 5 percent rate give the people 30 days to pay back instead of the 7 to 14 days
3682563 just like some of the people who reached out for some of these loans the people who are gathering some of these signatures are also desperate for their one dollar
3682564 what i saw was a general aura of confusion that had been created for these petitioners i assume by the payday lending industry
3682565 and these petitioners were passing on their confusion to me and to other voters
3682566 if anyone has any actual evidence that something was said incorrectly we ask that the circulators name be obtained and we will take swift action to investigate and remove the employee if necessary
3682567 vague allegations of election law violations serve only to undermine the entire electoral process
3682568 we get 30 minutes to carve whatever we want and i dont know what im going to carve until 30 seconds before i start
3682569 i like carving bears eagles lighthouses cabins and small animals
3682570 ive been carving for 10 years and have been in too many competitions to count
3682571 we get to work hard for 30 minutes and try not to mess up its fun for the audience to see what our creations can be and how fast we do this
3682572 i like their talent and how fast they can do it last year i think they made a bear and a house
3682573 ive seen this a couple of times and its interesting to watch
3682574 ive always loved teaching i always will and i love my fourth graders
3682575 i was very honored to receive it i was very surprised when i got the phone call its nice when you get recognized for something especially when its unexpected
3682576 i really enjoy the fourth fifth and sixth grade years they are so full of wonder and they want to learn
3682577 you can just see the wonder and delight on their faces and that little light that little glow when they get it
3682578 im extremely honored especially this early in my career ive had a lot of people to support me and to learn from
3682579 its just such a huge honor just to be a part of this day
3682580 the school is like a family i have one goal in mind thats the kids id like to stay there forever
3682581 i think its a shame ed got himself involved in something like this especially when he did some good things for this county but i believe he betrayed the public and elected officials trust and he needs to repay the money
3682582 thus restitution can be ordered only for those acts that constitute the crime for which the defendant was convicted and sentenced
3682583 moreover there must be sufficient evidence in the record from which the court can ascertain the amount of the restitution to a reasonable degree of certainty
3682584 the trial court could impose restitution for the economic loss caused only by his voting in favor of the resolution hiring evans amp associates
3682585 therefore the trial court erred in ordering kenily to pay restitution of any damages relative to his wifes employment at the county engineers office
3682586 marie filled out an application and was hired by the company on that date and two days later the resolution was passed by the commissioners marie told me ed approached her days prior to march 28 at their home and asked if she would be interested in working at the company she told him no she wanted to stay home and take care of the grandkids ed said it was a job she could do at home and then she became interested

3682638 este fin de semana me quiero quitar el mal sabor de boca que me dej el gran premio de alemania
3682639 el a o pasado estuve bastante mal s lo pude ser s ptimo por lo que me fui decepcionado este a o espero que sea diferente sobre todo ahora que lidero el campeonato y vengo de un gran triunfo en laguna seca he disfrutado de las vacaciones de verano un par n en el que he aprovechado para disfrutar de la familia y los amigos pero ahora ya s lo pienso en carreras s que brno ser complicado y que casey es un adversario formidable por ello hemos de mejorar en los entrenamientos desde el viernes para encontrar la mejor puesta a punto de la moto restan siete carreras y he so ado en que la pr xima sea tan divertida como lo fue la ltima en estados unidos
3682640 este fin de semana me quiero quitar el mal sabor de boca que me dej el gran premio de alemania
3682641 el par n me ha servido para coger fuerzas de cara a este nuevo tramo de la temporada en el que tengo puesta much sima ilusi n espero poder recuperar el tiempo perdido y seguir escalando posiciones estamos yendo paso a paso cada carrera sinti ndonos mucho mejor y nos vemos preparados para obtener otro gran resultado brno es uno de los mejores circuitos me encanta adem s este a o lo han reasfaltado estaba muy bacheado y creo que ser beneficiosa la nueva situaci n
3682642 la lesi n ya ha quedado atr s me encuentro perfecto muy animado as que debo pensar en adaptarme a la moto cuanto antes coger el m ximo de confianza y as regresar a los tiempos de los mejores brno es un trazado en el que qued sexto el a o pasado tengo buenos recuerdos y espero mucho de l me gusta y creo que llego con las pilas lo suficientemente cargadas como para lograr un buen resultado y si es un podio mucho mejor
3682643 este fin de semana me quiero quitar el mal sabor de boca que me dej el gran premio de alemania
3682644 a n quedan dos semanas para que el mundial de trial vuelva a la acci n pero yo aunque pueda parecer que el manejo de una moto nunca se olvida hace d as que estoy preparando el regreso cuando media espa a est de vacaciones y la otra mitad est contando las horas para irse a mi me toca estar metido en la rutina de los entrenamientos para continuar optando a las cotas m s altas mi nica meta es salir victorioso de los distintos compromisos que quedan esta temporada
3682645 me tom un respiro hace algunos d as un leve respiro ya que este deporte es muy sacrificado y todo lo que uno hace sin rutina de trabajo se nota despu s sobre la moto en este deporte una cosa est clara si dejas de entrenar durante un mes cuando vuelves eres otro yo por suerte llevo una vida muy normal y no tengo que preocuparme por los excesos ya que simplemente para m no existen aunque parezca raro ya ten a ganas de volver a los entrenamientos al cien por cien estoy muy contento de como va este a o piloto para ganar me encuentro especialmente bien de forma y veo muchas cosas positivas en la temporada adem s y eso quiz s es lo m s importante sigo disfrutando sobre la moto ya que ganar es lo mejor que te puede pasar y antes de este par n estival llevaba encadenadas tres victorias consecutivas
3682646 otra cosa no pero la moral siempre la tengo a tope ahora con los resultados que estamos consiguiendo est en sus cotas m s altas voy l der del campeonato de espa a con cinco puntos de ventaja sobre toni bou cuando quedan tres citas no es ventaja suficiente por lo que no puedo empezar a especular con los resultados pero si algo est claro es que la mejor posici n es la m a y no la de los que est n detr s
3682647 en campeonato de espa a no me puedo quejar he subido siempre al podio dos segundos y dos primeros
3682648 el campeonato del mundo ya es otro cantar no nos est yendo mal soy segundo a s lo doce puntos de mi rival tambi n bou y las sensaciones est n siendo muy buenas la prueba de estados unidos no se me dio del todo bien y encima al ser doble me fastidi bastante pero a n quedan tres pruebas puntuables de carrera nica cada una de ellas pero en todo caso muy duras para mi pero tambi n para bou y el resto de rivales
3682649 este fin de semana me quiero quitar el mal sabor de boca que me dej el gran premio de alemania
3682650 brno me trae muy buenos recuerdos del a o pasado consegu la pole provisional el viernes y el segundo puesto el s bado pero en carrera me sali un neum tico defectuoso y me ca cuando iba cuarto lo importante es que espero remontar el m ximo de puntos posibles en el tramo final del campeonato del mundo al que llegamos con mucha ilusi n tenemos el mismo material desde mugello esperamos a ver si aprilia nos echa una mano y el equipo y yo mismo nos ponemos las pilas
3682651 despu s de las vacaciones hay que volver a tope me gusta brno porque es una pista r pida a ver si consigo lo que nos ha faltado en la primera parte el objetivo es situarnos entre los ocho mejores en carrera cada vez estamos m s cerca en los ltimos grandes premios hemos mejorado en los entrenamientos y en alemania tuvimos la mala suerte de que me ca en el warm up el equipo y yo buscamos un fin de semana redondo para comenzar de la mejor forma posible el tramo final de 250cc

3682672 think about it this is the second attempt by mugabes office party to attempt to muddy the water the first was the story that theresa makone had been leaking the inside story to the press and had been found out in a sting operation and expelled nothing could have been further from the truth if it suited mugabe to claim that tomorrow was christmas trust me hed have a go we have dealt with all the elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
3682673 we have adjourned to give morgan tsvangirai more time to consider these matters another article states that mbeki has admitted that mutambara and mugabe have made an agreement
3682674 no deal has been signed by anyone dialogue is still continuing
3682675 tsvangirai is not special we will go ahead and rule with mutambara
3682676 no i will not watch history being repeated we have seen zanu pfs strategy of divide and rule in the past and this time it will not work not this time

3682804 there are no russian peacekeeping units or forces supporting them
3682805 we do not yet have a peace deal we have a provisional cessation of hostilities but this is significant progress
3682806 the idea of having monitors what you call peacekeeping troops i wouldnt call them like that but european controllers monitors facilitators yes yes and yes that is how europe should be on the ground
3682807 we have a tradition that in times of crisis the opposition stands united behind the president and does not attack him but georgia should not have advanced into tskhinvali south ossetias capital in so unprepared a way that was a grave error
3682808 the difference between lunatics and other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them
3682809 we will be forced to take other measures to prevent any repetition of the situation that emerged because of the outrageous georgian aggression
3682810 plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of russia
3682811 they shot their brother russian peacekeepers then they finished them off with bayonets so we are not going to see them there any more
3682812 there are a few things that need to be discussed to get a full ceasefire
3682813 the russians are saying that they will never again accept georgians in any form in south ossetia they see them as a trojan horse that started the attacks last week
3682814 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3682815 abkhazia and ossetia if i mention territorial integrity are to the best of my knowledge part of georgia
3682816 nato is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict
3682817 require the signing of a legally binding treaty on the non use of force

3682824 it appears to be an attempted robbery and thats all we really have at this time
3682825 i hate it the hell with them this stuff is so important because it frees us from them
3682826 i didnt hear any of you point the finger at the managers in your organizations were you just being polite or are they really not getting in the way of enterprise 2 0 the new social software platforms are a bureaucrats worst nightmare because they remove his ability to filter information or control its flow id expect then that each of you would have some examples of managers overtly or covertly trying to stop the spread and use of these tools are you telling me this hasnt happened
3682827 is devoted to stimulating incubating and accelerating innovation to achieve transformed services with better outcomes for citizens
3682828 im kind of surprised that the abstract concept of innovation remains so popular with policy makers and agencies using innovation as a catch all term to cover a wide range of changes in products services and organising creates the expectation that these changes share important characteristics and critically may share similar solutions but do they should they or could they to take the relatively narrow domain of integrated it on the one hand you have the apple approach on the other open source how much do they have in common not an awful lot

3682830 der verband hat in seiner panik eine berhastete entscheidung getroffen
3682831 der handel mit pers nlichen daten ist ein milliardengesch ft in dem es offenbar mafi se strukturen gibt
3682832 es gibt etwa 60 millionen adressen in deutschland bis auf einen kleinen teil d rften alle auf dem markt sein
3682833 wir haben in den letzten jahren doch h ufig auch selber sehr leichtfertig unsere daten verschenkt und weitergegeben
3682834 es gibt viele die hungrig sind nach unseren daten und ich glaube wir m ssen und sollten hier selber sorgf ltiger werden und nicht jedem der uns das goldene vom himmel verspricht dann im gegenzug die wertvollen daten geben
3682835 es kann keine gespr che mit den organisatoren eines v lkermordes geben
3682836 welche rolle die eu spielen kann um bei der absicherung des waffenstillstands und der weiteren stabilisierung in der region behilflich zu sein
3682837 wenn das so ist und das hat dieser fall ja bewiesen dann darf man einem solchen land keine hoffnung machen dass es einmal mitglied in der nato wird
3682838 die russen haben gesagt sie wollten teil der prosperierenden und fortschrittlichen internationalen gemeinschaft sein aber offen gesagt sie schaden sich dabei im moment sehr
3682839 dass russlands internationales ansehen und die frage welche rolle russland in der internationalen gemeinschaft spielen kann absolut zur disposition stehen
3682840 wir k nnen in der situation nicht guten gewissens eine gemeinsame marine bung abhalten
3682841 ist doch schon l ngst von den usa angezettelt durch den sogenannten raketenabwehrschirm der amerikaner in tschechien und polen
3682842 sie war mit jemandem zusammen der sie nicht gut behandelt hat
3682843 trotz erfolgter kosteneinsparungen und produktivit tsteigerungen k nnen wir jedoch die in einem sich eintr benden marktumfeld sehr dynamisch einsetzende absatzreduzierung und den damit verbundenen erl sr ckgang sowie den sprunghaften anstieg der rohmaterialpreise nicht schnell genug kompensieren
3682844 wir gehen davon aus dass wir die flache entwicklung auch im zweiten halbjahr sehen
3682845 das haben wir f r das zweite halbjahr auf einen zwei schicht betrieb heruntergefahren
3682846 wir blicken auf ein insgesamt erfreuliches 1 halbjahr zur ck in dem wir umsatz und absatz trotz der sich abzeichnenden konjunkturschw che erneut steigern konnten

3682852 arcandor hat immer und immer wieder deutlich gemacht dass die gesetzten ziele locker zu erreichen sein werden und nun wird die guidance mal eben so kassiert mir passt die ganze kommunikation des unternehmens nicht
3682853 es hat den anschein dass arcandor im kommenden jahr nun auch in den gesch ftsbereichen primondo und thomas cook mit konjunkturellen risiken rechnet einen wirklichen grund f r die gesenkte prognose nennt das unternehmen aber nicht
3682854 gerade vor dem hintergrund der nur geringen transparenz der zahlen w re aber glaubw rdigkeit f r das unternehmen besonders wichtig gewesen
3682855 sehr dynamisch einsetzende absatzreduzierung und den damit verbundenen erl sr ckgang sowie den sprunghaften anstieg der rohmaterialpreise nicht schnell genug kompensieren
3682856 ich glaube nicht dass es dieselbe berlegenheit der bayern geben wird wie im letzten jahr es wird am ende zwar wohl wieder f r den titel reichen trotzdem bin ich sicher dass wir vor einer sehr spannenden saison stehen
3682857 vanuit een zonovergoten madrid stuur ik jullie allemaal een hartlijke groet heb daarnet mijn fotos doorgebladerd kan haast niet geloven dat ik daar allemaal geweest ben
3682858 heerlijk geslapen in een zeer prettig pension hoewel een italiaanse pelgrim dacht dat het vandaag mooi weer zou worden regent het onophoudelijk ja dit is galici en men vertelt me dat ik ook geen andere verwachtingen hoef te hebben voor de aankomende dagen vandaag wordt het een beetje de dag van de realiteit mijn rug is nog niet helemaal lekker over een paar dagen gaat mijn vliegtuig hoe verder terugkijkend kom ik tot de slotsom dat mijn trip nu toe alle verwachtingen heeft overtroffen alle jaargetijden kwamen voorbij de gortdroge landschappen direct na l on brachten me in een sfeer van de woestijn kurkdroge gebarsten rode aarde hele maisvelden verbrand door de zon urenlang lopen zonder een tegenligger wat een ervaring dan een hele periode lente achtig meer kleur en bloeiende struiken vlakke landschappen oneindige vergezichten een bos met kastanjebomen heerlijke geuren vogels en vlinders dan de overgang naar de winter in ocebreiro een erbarmelijke overgang maar had dat niet graag willen missen de herfst die momenteel stevig aanwezig is met onophoudelijk regen windvlagen en sterk wisselende temperaturen ik besef me nu pas dat ik onderweg veel tijd genomen heb om de omgeving op te snuiven en cultuur te proeven en ik heb geen enkele kilometer afgeraffeld het einddoel werd betrekkelijk de intensiteit van de voettocht groeide met de dag ben erg blij met mijn benenwagen dat werkt perfect zoek een bus om wat op te schieten batterij bijna leeg groeten willem
3682859 vanaf sarria na veel omzwervingen een taxichauffeur gevonden die me naar cassanova brengt die afstand heb ik nodig ander mis ik the plain evengoed maak ik deze dag nog 23 km te voet en beland bij arzua via de plaatselijke vvv kom ik terecht in een typisch huis van galicie grote gastvrijheid heerlijk geslapen taditioneel eten ja weer vis een mooie evaring sluit de avond af met een klein lokaal glaasje sterk spul en slaap als een os
3682860 het laatste traject ik ben vroeg uit de veren even ontbijtje en op weg de pijntjes die ik de eerste ochtenden had komen niet meer terug het is verbazend hoe snel je lijf went aan het vele lopen vandaag het weerzien met s d c toen ik ton driessen op ging halen vond ik het een interessante stad met veel cultuur en inspiratie nu zal het mijn eindpunt worden van een heerlijke ervaring twaalf dagen intensief buiten zijn merken hoe je lijf zich aanpast en toch 32 km per dag aankan af en toe een beetje over de grens gaan zoals de afdaling bij het licht van de volle maan achteraf bleek een 2e paar schoenen een gouden greep geen enkele blaar het brandertje heeft zich met name in de eerste week met het mooie weer bewezen ik heb langs menig beekje of een mooi vergezicht een bakkie soep of koffie gemaakt de rugzak van bas was perfect op een gegeven moment ben je niet meer bewust dat je zon pukkel op je rug hebt hetgeen nog wel eens tot onverwachte botsingen kan leiden in winkeltjes de lumix fotocamera van bas heeft ook zijn diensten bewezen ik heb zon 5 gigabyte aan fotos filmjes het schrijven van een stukkie voor het weblog deed ik graag hoewel ik zeker 4 x over mijn mobieltje heen in slaap ben gevallen en de volgende dag wakker werd met een half afgemaakt mailtje de spaanse keuken kan me niet bekoren toch heb ik hier een aantal dingen weten te waarderen bijna elke dag tussen de middag een grote slaschotel met tonijn en brood ook s avonds nam ik vaak een vis gerecht als je stevige trek hebt smaakt alles lekker wat ik minder vond waren de grote steden leon ponferrada het heeft me veel moeite gekost aan de drukte te wennen maar ik ben er ook veel aan het dolen geslagen op de hele route waren er niet veel pelgrims een klein aantal mensen heb ik vaker getroffen maar ik vond het een heerlijk ervaring om in the middle of nowhere in je uppie te zijn wat tegenviel was de zooi die steeds weer uit die kl rugzak komt en er ook weer in moet heel erg leuk en opbeurend vond ik de achtergelaten berichtjes op de weblog het was trouwens geweldig dat ik mijn verlagjes kon doen via de email per telefoon wat ik niet snel zal vergeten is de pas bij ocebreiro winters stijl en taai ik had daar flink moeite mee maar eenmaal boven dan voel je je een echte overwinnaar santiago komt in beeld het aantal pelgrims neemt toe je komt weer in de bewoonde wereld een dubbel gevoel mooi om hier te zijn maar wat jammer dat deze intensieve levenswijze voorbij is het compestelaat maakt weer een hoop goed ik sta voor de immense kathedraal en de hemel is staalblauw het geeft een geweldig gevoel dat ik nog lang probeer vast te houden hartelijke groeten willem
3682861 vandaag de voorlaatste loopdag ik zal het echt gaan missen voor vandaag plan ik 28 a 30km in zodat ik vrijdag redelijk op tijd santiago bereik
3682862 gisteravond was het zo romantisch in dit dorpje veel sneeuw winterse plaatjes en een mooie sfeer
3682863 op tijd vertrokken uit la faba wetende dat er nog een zeer zwaar traject te gaan is naar ocebreiro een uiterst onaangename route veel langs wegen gelopen waarbij de enorme sneeuwval en regen met verraste
3682864 for four years we knew we could probably get under 7 minutes
3682865 i could not believe how close to me those guys were

3682868 to be in the same group with the greatest olympians who ever lived to have the most golds in history is unbelievable

3682876 completamente normal que rusia quiera defender los intereses de sus compatriotas en su pa s y los de los ruso parlantes fuera de sus fronteras
3682877 los pacificadores rusos cumplir n y seguir n cumpliendo sus funciones en el c ucaso
3682878 son un factor clave de la seguridad en el c ucaso
3682879 es extra a la situaci n cuando un personaje que perpetr miles de asesinatos es considerado terrorista y otro que hizo lo mismo es considerado presidente de un estado soberano elegido leg timamente el derecho internacional no puede tener un doble rasero

3682885 how did you feel while carrying the potatoes with you for 1 week
3682886 this is exactly the situation when you carry your hatred for somebody inside your heart
3682887 over the last year we have heard a lot of greenwash unsubstantiated marketing claims about how new it products are doing their bit to protect the environment
3682888 tickets to blizzcon 2008 are now sold out blizzard would like to thank everyone once again for their overwhelming interest in this years show if you were unable to secure tickets please keep in mind that directv will be broadcasting blizzcon live from the anaheim convention center on october 11 and 12 in the meantime keep an eye on the blizzcon 2008 website for updates on panels exhibits events and more blizzard looks forward to meeting some of you at the show

3682890 whod have guessed that big brother would be a beautiful brunette named lodge
3682891 it was his idea to use a library computer so they couldnt trace it back to my home computer
3682892 well make back our outlay with the records we sell
3682893 youll see the really good stuff rise to the top of the internet at some point
3682894 and people will be able to judge for themselves its a revolution its going to change the world of music as we know it
3682895 with all this hubbub about record people worried about the internet the record business is up ten percent instead of ten billion its thirteen billion this year
3682896 iceland is a very competitive market and we need a strong and reliable partner to ensure our success the agreement with ericsson gives s minn the opportunity to meet increasing subscriber demands for exciting new mobile services

3682898 were seeing an increase in consumer awareness of a variety of mobile advertising campaigns from text message to interactive games to mobile internet banner advertisements
3682899 with mobile phone usage growing its logical for more companies to seek mobile marketing as a way to reach their segmented targets in this direct and highly interactive medium
3682900 these findings indicate the degree to which the mobile phone is used as a marketing channel with enhanced handsets and flat rate data tariffs increasingly common it is only a matter of time before mobile internet advertising starts to rival the penetration of sms or text message marketing
3682901 actualmente estamos aislados salvo algunas excepciones donde hay intercambio de datos casi no existe comunicaci n v a internet entre las polic as de las dos naciones
3682902 pero despu s de haber trabajado durante meses para concretar acuerdos que se van a plantear en este encuentro binacional que es fundamental para la toma de decisiones confiamos en que los mandatarios los firmen
3682903 texas por ejemplo es un estado donde no existe el delito de acopio de armas una persona puede tener mil pistolas o ametralladoras en su casa o negocio y no pasa nada
3682904 es decir lo que estamos haciendo es abrir el mercado para tener mayor oferta pero siempre vigilando la calidad pueden venir de muchos lugares pero vamos a estar siempre vigilantes de la calidad
3682905 aproximadamente 20 minutos despu s de que l comenzara su calentamiento sufri una debilidad s bita del cuerpo de la cara del brazo y de la pierna del lado izquierdo yo corrobor que l estaba d bil de tal manera que no pod a mover ni el brazo ni la pierna cuando en neurolog a nosotros vemos este d ficit neurol gico pensamos inmediatamente en una unidad que se llama un evento cerebrovascular sobre este diagn stico hicimos algunos estudios y una resonancia magn tica demuestra que la arteria que irriga la mayor parte del hemisferio cerebral derecho cuyo nombre es arteria cerebral media se encontraba tapada por un co gulo y se estaba desarrollando un infarto cerebral en el territorio que irriga esta arteria y el territorio es extenso es una situaci n delicada
3682906 la situaci n de salud de carlos en este momento es delicada es una enfermedad que requiere mucho trabajo y en este momento se encuentra estable desde el punto de vista hemodin mico es decir que su presi n arterial frencuencia cardiaca y funci n respiratoria se encuentran bien l est consciente puede hablar porque la lesi n del cerebro no est da ando el rea del lenguaje y comprensi n as que esperamos poder recanalizar estar arteria aunque no tenemos la certeza absoluta porque es un co gulo grande
3682907 son muchos los detalles que habr que cuidar en la terapia intensiva vamos a esperar a las pr ximas 48 o 72 horas que es el tiempo de m s riesgo para este tipo de enfermedades el pron stico hoy es incierto y esperamos con buena fe recuperar al m ximo la funci n de su cuerpo del lado izquierdo ahorita estamos en la etapa de tratar de rescatar la mayor cantidad de cerebro y no podemos hacer en este momento un conteo de da os sobre todo porque se nos vienen dos o tres d as complicados
3682908 were not saying this is the end of the diablo universe but we are trying to bring this storyline to a close
3682909 were definitely going to bring a few of them in
3682910 we are one of the first hospitals in the uk to use this device
3682911 being stuck onto the patients skin means it does not require the patient to have an injection so has a number of benefits
3682912 it is safer in use more convenient for the patient needs less nurse time to manage and allows for easier and earlier mobilisation after an operation
3682913 pain management following surgery is a crucial component of patient care and recovery
3682914 this new system is convenient and easy to use offering good pain management following some types of surgery
3682915 it will help to improve recovery after surgery providing improvements in both postoperative comfort and mobility
3682916 and now for the more disturbing and or pornographic images
3682917 i could be wrong but i think that on the whole most people will say that the actual images are slightly less offensive than one would expect from a text description
3682918 i have it on very good authority that discerning females and gay men find graying pudgy middle aged men with an accent close to gov
3682919 this was a few years back but ive only gotten cuter with age
3682920 but one thing id emphasize is that that this material was not easily accessible you needed to know what subdirectory to enter in order to access items
3682921 so im not as scandalized as it seems other folks are this was never material that he meant for the public to see
3682922 everyone in the family stores stuff there and i had no idea what some of the stuff is or was i was surprised that it was there
3682923 is it prurient i dont know what to tell you
3682924 i think its odd and interesting its part of life
3682925 the sort of naughtiness youd find in the dirty birthday cards section at spencer gifts
3682926 the very worst excuse for hosting a porn stash since mark penn told his mom im keeping that stack of juggs for a friend
3682927 i guess i lost a little bit of self esteem
3682928 that time that you made it with the whole hockey team
3682929 has dropped below 50 percent for the first time in 14 years of polling
3682930 im pretty certain that as a factual matter he cannot be recalled
3682931 there is the matter of whether a state could recall a senator if it had a recall provision on the books
3682932 im no lawyer constitutional or otherwise but since no serious effort has ever been made to recall a senator we dont have any case law dealing with the issue
3682933 so this page pertains primarily to the recall of state officials some of these laws may be applicable for both state and u s elected officials but you would have to read the states constitutional articles to find out their exact definition of an elected official
3682934 if somehow connecticut managed to put a recall law on the books and then tried to use it against lieberman there litigation would start to flow and everything ive read on the subject indicates that such a move would fail on u s constitutional grounds so to shorten my answer no lieberman cant be recalled
3682935 im just waiting to get through this year when i have a 51 vote majority
3682936 he will be ousted of all his leadership responsibilities if a few more states vote for democratic candidates in the senate
3682937 latched onto john mccain because he knows this and has betrayed the values he says he believes in for purely personal gain
3682938 but that has the downside of putting lieberman in a good cabinet position
3682939 anytime we have a problem here with the exception of iraq joe lieberman is with us
3682940 i am not going back to prison i will commit suicide first
3682941 they really did a hoover number on her that is unprecendented for a prostitution bust and i dont think she knows what it is they were after either
3682942 i was obviously sitting on a powder keg of information
3682943 the united states government has been directly or indirectly benefiting from the operation of her service by monitoring her customers and is thus equitably barred from prosecuting her
3682944 with two or more years of college education who either work and or go to school in the daytime
3682945 whats so funny to me is how cheap these services seem to be in d c youd pay sooooo much more in l a
3682946 and to go back into it in a way that i felt and i believed i would never have a repeat experience
3682947 and i guess i did a pretty dog gone good job
3682948 because for 13 years from late 1993 until last august of 2006 we did not have one bust
3682949 entirely female managed our philosophy is to develop an on going and sound relationship of mutual respect and consideration with each and every staff member
3682950 for those individuals without experience regular guidance and assistance is offered by seasoned professional s
3682951 which by the way was picked up on one of those homeland security terrorist watch programs the ones which are supposed to be watching the terrorists
3682952 it is something that i want to explore when this is all over when my actual civil criminal case is all over i am even talking to some folks right now about putting together a documentary on what the police have done do and will continue to do to defenseless women in this country involved in the sex industry
3682953 vitter has the ability to send us to war in part
3682954 we dont know what the rationale has been for them to go forward with the case
3682955 other than the fact that we simply wouldnt fold and give them what they wanted at that time i think they pretty much wanted to just take my entire life savings from me so of course they ratcheted it up a notch and it went into the criminal realm
3682956 now that i am freed from the chains of this business in a way that i never thought i would be free
3682957 in the context no one can seriously conclude that we are suggesting that wired readers take these substances
3682958 given the magazines cheeky writing style that may be lost
3682959 we at wired arent doctors anyone who takes a bushel of drugs based on our say so must be high
3682960 is just such a hand wringing piece of bullshit that i have to weigh in
3682961 it was a stupid controversy over a relatively innocuous drug story
3682962 well never solve societys problems if we cant at least speak honestly about them
3682963 is it a jumpy high like cocaine or a dancey laughy high like shrooms or is it groovy like lsd does anyone know where i could score a rattlesnake in midtown
3682964 i dont think wired could influence anyone to take meth
3682965 a s long as were shaming maybe the new york times should be ashamed of itself
3682966 for assuming we are a nation of six year olds who cant be spoken to honestly or trusted to make rational decisions
3682967 after the experts presentations it seemed clear that the technology exists to make real child porn look fake and much more significantly to make cg porn which looks genuine enough to fool ordinary people
3682968 given the above i bet most defendants and their attorneys who raise the cg defense are bullshitting
3682969 we were targetting oil from this month and gas fromseptember but there is a slight change now because of delay ingetting fpso and we withdrew two vessels from operations forabout two weeks after the new shipping ministry order
3682970 the north south divide is not a transient problem that reflects a short lived hiatus as manufacturing declines and service sector economies take its place
3682971 nor does it reflect a failure of government policy to do what is needed
3682972 rather it is evidence that the north the powerhouse of the industrial revolution is now a less desirable location for business for reasons that are geographical and entirely outside its control or that of central and local government
3682973 liverpool was once a booming city made rich on the cotton trade
3682974 manchester leeds and newcastle all have decided strengths but they are not successful enough to deliver prosperity to neighbouring towns such as rochdale bradford and sunderland in the way that london is able to support relatively poor communities in north kent and south essex
3682975 it is hard to see the wider manchester area as short of housing
3682976 it would be odd to expand the city dramatically when there is so little demand for housing in nearby towns
3682977 this independent report does not reflect conservative party policy and we do not agree with its conclusions we wholeheartedly support the regeneration of northern cities
3682978 weve had numerous people interested in doing storage sheds or putting up metal buildings but that wasnt the way we wanted to go
3682979 you can go just about anywhere in the country and people have a rough idea where madison is thats not the case with mcfarland or oregon
3682980 right now there just arent many places to hold a business lunch in this part of the town
3682981 to me this is one of the key pieces of real estate in the city of madison
3682982 its the first place you see after you get off the interstate
3682983 what the city really needs is about 1 billion for road improvements
3682984 we are still in the very early stages of planning and development for this site
3682985 no construction start or opening dates have been set yet
3682986 baby boomers are coming of age and with age comes disability
3682987 visit ability to me means will someone in a wheelchair be able to get in and pee
3682988 says tangney 63 who doesnt use a chair himself but knows many who do including former union cab riders
3682989 the city has been talking all about solar energy but it needs to walk the talk
3682990 more than the law requires but whether it meets an advocates hopes remains to be seen
3682991 the bottom line is curt couldnt secure financing and is no longer involved
3682992 its going to happen but we want to make sure we get somebody solid in there
3682993 and a lot of our students are coming from special ed programs in high school
3682994 the technical college is really becoming the first stop of choice for a lot of students and particularly for students with disabilities
3682995 for one thing many students stay at home and go to matc
3682996 you look at people with autism or multiple physical disabilities and going to college and living in the residence halls that would be a ginormous step but here at matc its more of a mini step that makes things more manageable
3682997 it gives a lot of good information on getting started in your first year of college and basically gives you the 411 of how everything is set up
3682998 one of the things i learned last year was not to take a full load of classes or i might really be overwhelmed
3682999 a lot of people i went to high school with came here and dropped out because they took a full load and it was just too much for them so if people take the time to come to this program and to listen to what is said it can be a big big help
3683000 not only does it give them tools to succeed but there also is a social connection i think it opens the eyes of people to look around and say wow they have a disability i never knew that
3683001 so with a big group at this orientation people look around and say okay they are asking for help so its okay for me to ask for help too
3683002 the documentation they provide us must be from a qualified professional for that disability and we have to figure out how it affects them
3683003 and then once we verify its a bona fide disability under the law we have to figure out what will be reasonable accommodations
3683004 for students who have not been able to read or participate in school like everyone else this can be a life changing experience
3683005 the real challenge for us is text books dont read like the adventures of huckleberry finn
3683006 theyre not just text there are a lot of graphics and pictures that we have to make references to
3683007 these kinds of technology are not generally what they use at high schools i mean theres not a lot of schools providing digital files a student can listen to on an ipod
3683008 the most amazing thing about this is that for so many years of their lives many of these students cant access things like everyone else previously they had to read something over and over and over but now they can spend an hour studying just like their classmates
3683009 its suddenly not so much of a burden and they can be successful
3683010 because a student has a learning disability its reasonable to give them a note taker
3683011 its not reasonable to let them use open notes on their test because that may impact the academic integrity of the class and might give that person an advantage the accommodations arent meant to do that its meant to level the playing field
3683012 ultimately there is some resistance by some students and their parents
3683013 but the way i always frame it is this you have this big jump from high school to college but the jump from college to work is even bigger
3683014 we dont want the students to just pass classes here we need them to learn how to be successful and actually get a job
3683015 sin que se pidiera el dni ni se miraran los veh culos y nada a nadie pod a entrar quien quisiera
3683016 ni cerraron las puertas del recinto ni capturaron al autor ni ni nada
3683017 here we are in 2008 and its early august and were already seeing problems
3683018 im very concerned that were going to see more problems throughout 2008
3683019 they wanted to go out and get 20 cards in an hour and just be done with it
3683020 this is the very reason i have fought for photo id in order to receive a ballot
3683021 we have added more names on the voter rolls and we still have no idea if the person that is handed the ballot is truly that person
3683022 unfortunately the gop will use any excuse to call for the use of voter id
3683023 if it rains too hard theyll say its because people arent required to show their drivers licenses when they vote
3683024 someone tried to game the system and those people were caught
3683025 part of our mission was to hire out of that community
3683026 so you tend to get people who are a little less educated
3683027 while acorn may have reported it themselves i dont think theres any question that they felt like eventually they were going to be caught so maybe it would be better to report it now and throw themselves at the mercy of the authorities
3683028 the reality is the democrats i think believe they benefit more from people who potentially wouldnt be eligible to vote being under less scrutiny
3683029 we look at the rules as they are whether we like them or not we wish there was a photo id requirement there isnt we wish that there were other reforms to the system that we dont have
3683030 with the systems of checks and balances in place including our statewide voter registration anyone who tries to do something like that will get caught
3683031 we have a great level of participation in wisconsin because of election day registration and many states are following our lead
3683032 we believe in voter enfranchisement we think its a good thing
3683033 and the reason i say that isnt because ive got a whole bunch of proof to throw in your lap today the reason i say it is the historical trends here in presidential races in the last three cycles
3683034 if you have a total swing of 4 000 or 5 000 votes that could make a difference in a statewide election
3683035 i would challenge anyone making that claim to show me actual cases in which people actually did vote fraudulently
3683036 thats like saying we should outlaw driving because someone might speed
3683037 prithee put off your journey until sunrise and sleep in your own bed to night a lone woman is troubled with such dreams and such thoughts that shes afeard of herself sometimes pray tarry with me this night dear husband of all nights in the year
3683038 of all nights in the year this one night must i tarry away from thee my journey as thou callest it forth and back again must needs be done twixt now and sunrise what my sweet pretty wife cost thou doubt me already and we but three months married
3683039 and may you find all well when you come back
3683040 say thy prayers dear faith and go to bed at dusk and no harm will come to thee
3683041 what a wretch am i to leave her on such an errand she talks of dreams too methought as she spoke there was trouble in her face as if a dream had warned her what work is to be done to night but no no t would kill her to think it well shes a blessed angel on earth and after this one night ill cling to her skirts and follow her to heaven
3683042 what if the devil himself should be at my very elbow
3683043 the clock of the old south was striking as i came through boston and that is full fifteen minutes agone
3683044 this is a dull pace for the beginning of a journey take my staff if you are so soon weary
3683045 having kept covenant by meeting thee here it is my purpose now to return whence i came i have scruples touching the matter thou wotst of
3683046 let us walk on nevertheless reasoning as we go and if i convince thee not thou shalt turn back we are but a little way in the forest yet
3683047 my father never went into the woods on such an errand nor his father before him
3683048 well said goodman brown i have been as well acquainted with your family as with ever a one among the puritans and thats no trifle to say i helped your grandfather the constable when he lashed the quaker woman so smartly through the streets of salem and it was i that brought your father a pitch pine knot kindled at my own hearth to set fire to an indian village in king philips war they were my good friends both and many a pleasant walk have we had along this path and returned merrily after midnight i would fain be friends with you for their sake
3683049 i marvel they never spoke of these matters or verily i marvel not seeing that the least rumor of the sort would have driven them from new england we are a people of prayer and good works to boot and abide no such wickedness
3683050 i have a very general acquaintance here in new england the deacons of many a church have drunk the communion wine with me the selectmen of divers towns make me their chairman and a majority of the great and general court are firm supporters of my interest the governor and i too but these are state secrets
3683051 howbeit i have nothing to do with the governor and council they have their own ways and are no rule for a simple husbandman like me but were i to go on with thee how should i meet the eye of that good old man our minister at salem village oh his voice would make me tremble both sabbath day and lecture day
3683052 well go on goodman brown go on but prithee dont kill me with laughing
3683053 there is my wife faith it would break her dear little heart and id rather break my own
3683054 een go thy ways goodman brown i would not for twenty old women like the one hobbling before us that faith should come to any harm
3683055 a marvel truly that goody cloyse should be so far in the wilderness at nightfall
3683056 but with your leave friend i shall take a cut through the woods until we have left this christian woman behind being a stranger to you she might ask whom i was consorting with and whither i was going
3683057 betake you the woods and let me keep the path
3683058 yea truly is it and in the very image of my old gossip goodman brown the grandfather of the silly fellow that now is
3683059 mingled with fine wheat and the fat of a new born babe
3683060 so as i was saying being all ready for the meeting and no horse to ride on i made up my mind to foot it for they tell me there is a nice young man to be taken into communion to night but now your good worship will lend me your arm and we shall be there in a twinkling
3683061 i may not spare you my arm goody cloyse but here is my staff if you will
3683062 my mind is made up not another step will i budge on this errand what if a wretched old woman do choose to go to the devil when i thought she was going to heaven is that any reason why i should quit my dear faith and go after her
3683063 sit here and rest yourself a while and when you feel like moving again there is my staff to help you along
3683064 i had rather miss an ordination dinner than meeting they tell me that some of our community are to be here from falmouth and beyond and others from connecticut and rhode island besides several of the indian powwows who after their fashion know almost as much deviltry as the best of us moreover there is a goodly young woman to be taken into communion
3683065 spur up or we shall be late nothing can be done you know until i get on the ground
3683066 with heaven above and faith below i will yet stand firm against the devil
3683067 there is no good on earth and sin is but a name come devil for to thee is this world given
3683068 let us hear which will laugh loudest think not to frighten me with your deviltry come witch come wizard come indian powwow come devil himself and here comes goodman brown you may as well fear him as he fear you
3683069 to the communion of your race ye have found thus young your nature and your destiny my children look behind you
3683070 are all whom ye have reverenced from youth ye deemed them holier than yourselves and shrank from your own sin contrasting it with their lives of righteousness and prayerful aspirations heavenward yet here are they all in my worshipping assembly this night it shall be granted you to know their secret deeds how hoary bearded elders of the church have whispered wanton words to the young maids of their households how many a woman eager for widows weeds has given her husband a drink at bedtime and let him sleep his last sleep in her bosom how beardless youths have made haste to inherit their fathers wealth and how fair damsels blush not sweet ones have dug little graves in the carder and bidden me the sole guest to an infants funeral by the sympathy of your human hearts for sin ye shall scent out all the places whether in church bed chamber street field or forest where crime has been committed and shall exult to behold the whole earth one stain of guilt one mighty blood spot far more than this it shall be yours to penetrate in every bosom the deep mystery of sin the fountain of all wicked arts and which inexhaustibly supplies more evil impulses than human power than my power at its utmost can make manifest in deeds and now my children look upon each other
3683071 depending upon one anothers hearts ye had still hoped that virtue were not all a dream now are ye undeceived evil is the nature of mankind evil must be your only happiness welcome again my children to the communion of your race
3683072 with that many people supporting us it should help us play to our potential
3683073 our preparation before the match includes dealing with heavy pressure and we just have to think about positive results
3683074 its a very normal thing athletes may run into some problems or difficulties in their first match its what we expected
3683075 prices are at a level which any other day would haveappeared attractive but therere worries that slowing globalgrowth momentum may translate into more gloomy earningsoutlook
3683076 pttep shares slipped more than the ex dividend affectbecause its likely that crude oil prices may fall further
3683077 their recovery came on as the central bank wants totighten supply of bank shares to the market by letting banksbuy back their shares
3683078 i was a little nervous before the fight but when i got into the ring i heard all the fans cheering for me and then i forgot about the pressure i really love this feeling i felt like a man in the ring
3683079 the whole strategy was to come out and basically scam this guy
3683080 to figure out how he moves what his speed was like that sort of thing in the third we use the term bring the dog out they released the leash out on me
3683081 we wanted him to take his time with the guy
3683082 we know the type of power that wilder has and we know that he can wear guys down
3683083 the center under beckys leadership has managed to galvanize the neighborhood to work on its own behalf on many fronts
3683084 the new center is a gleaming example but just the most recent of whats been possible because of her leadership
3683085 it just kept coming up it had been a blighted eyesore for so long neighbors wanted to see it become something vibrant
3683086 becky thinks the community deserves to have a great space she had a picture in her head and just never let go i think thats why were here
3683087 it was a bizarre feeling all these white people it took a while to feel comfortable being in the majority
3683088 becky was just this dynamo driving all the different programs
3683089 the thing about her that always struck me she was able to do a broad range of things it was not just programs for kids or seniors or the environment
3683090 if becky sees a need she fills it and that strengthens ties to the community center
3683091 its one thing that helped make the neighborhood what it is
3683092 we had moments when wed say we cant do this
3683093 people were excited but skeptical it was an ambitious project
3683094 but the reputation of the atwood center was very strong
3683095 she has a great sense of humor and shes compassionate
3683096 she continued to donate it many years after she left the legislature
3683097 we have a higher number of kids who have anger issues and challenging behavior issues
3683098 kids dont get angry for no reason some of their needs are not being met
3683099 physically you are not with your kids and then mentally and emotionally youre not with them when you are home i know how that is because thats how i am with my kids a lot
3683100 it isnt comfortable interacting with people who are different whether its socioeconomically religiously racially
3683101 she knows how the world is put together from the mge board room to a 2 year old to a homeless person she just knows
3683102 people are really excited about it its a real asset to the neighborhood
3683103 were a community center offering a beautiful space that hopefully makes people feel good to be in no matter who they are and we invested a lot of time and effort and money to do that
3683104 i do have this dream of someday turning that building into a charter school
3683105 bringing the building structure into compliance in such a way as to preserve its historical character was a big challenge
3683106 i envisioned more of a historical restoration but i know compromises have to be made for public usage
3683107 they are historical artifacts that we wanted to leave to pay respect to the history of the building and the neighborhood
3683108 when it was kupfer ironworks it was inconvenient but they worked around it for years and years but for a community center it is not acceptable
3683109 i can almost hear the laughter of the children coming from the corners of this building already
3683110 we must keep faith that our goals are still out there despite the bumps in the road from credit markets
3683111 institutional capital should be backing the needs of main street
3683112 one hour and 2 minutes is a really really tough race
3683113 now is the moment to enjoy and to be happy and proud that i won
3683114 im very very happy and very proud of this ride today and to go home with two medals
3683115 in the situation i was in not being able to do the tour de i was really motivated
3683116 i worked very hard for this and it paid off i pictured myself on the top step but this is brilliant

3683120 notwithstanding the current market dislocation ourperformance in 2008 underscores the resilience and value of thebusiness model

3683127 yes we do and we have some great performers some young athletes who can do something exceptional
3683128 we need to capture the imagination of those who follow the sport and to reach out to the next generation
3683129 the lord said that we are the salt of the earth we should make people thirsty for what we have
3683130 why would we want to do that unless we were going to legalise drugs
3683131 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3683132 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3683133 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
3683134 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning

3683143 theres been a bit of tension for some time they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked
3683144 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together
3683145 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken

3683158 we have said 2009 or early 2009 on occasions and thats as detailed as we can get at the moment
3683159 this recent conflict in georgia has highlighted the heavy dependence that international oil and gas operators place on the countries that lie along the pipeline transport corridor
3683160 what has been highlighted over the past few days is that despite the careful routing of pipelines to avoid both russia and the middle east it still comes with a very significant degree of political risk
3683161 it is quite remarkable that the world has lost one million barrels but the market has not really been bothered it shows a fundamental shift in market perceptions

3683184 hqs sales rebounded in the second quarter of 2008 from our traditionally slow first quarter but while we did not directly suffer from the severe winter storms that hit mainland china beginning of 2008 we were subsequently impacted by dramatic cost increases due to decreased tilapia supplies and increased cost of feed fuel and labor although through the avoidance of long term fixed price contracts we are usually able to pass along price increases to our customers the rapid rate and scope of cost increases outpaced our price increases the situation has since stabilized and current prices reflect expected profitability
3683185 hqs sales were below our expectations as many buyers delayed or reduced purchases due to expected substantial price corrections at the end of the summer
3683186 however our direct sales increased markedly during the quarter the benefits of these sales is being felt now as costs stabilize and new higher margin products are introduced to more buyers directly in touch with new consumer preferences this relationship led to the declaration of our tilapia bill of rights which allowed our more direct buyers to address consumers food safety environmental and health concerns building further the relationship and the reliance on hqs quality health product sales were also affected by increased costs as some raw material costs experienced substantial increases a new price structure reflecting these increases and continuing historic profitability has been announced for september 1 of this year

3683208 if they were georgian they certainly would be influenced but they are not georgian

3683292 the northern was an unexpected opportunity to bring together a lot of work we had done in the last few years into one show and just doing that was a satisfying experience that wouldnt have happened otherwise
3683293 lets hope that the prize can continue to profile and value work that takes place beyond the commercial gallery sector and the mainstream and just happens to be happening in the north too this approach can keep it distinct from the other major art prizes
3683294 thats where nursing staff took these babies and left them to die
3683295 christ hospital and we now know other hospitals and clinics around the country are involved in an abortion procedure called induced labor abortion
3683296 my experience was that they the babies survive as short as a few minutes to once almost as long as an eight hour shift
3683297 to be clear these were living babies who were left out to die and they were issued both birth and death certificates according to illinois state law

3683341 having had an std roughly quadruples a womans odds of reporting sexual pain and triples her lubrication problems
3683342 sexual dysfunction among older adults prevalence and risk factors from a nationally representative u s probability sample of men and women 57 to 85 years of age
3683343 the results point to a need for physicians who are treating older adults experiencing sexual problems to take into account their physical health and also consider their mental health and their satisfaction with their intimate relationship in making any assessment
3683344 we placed our participants in an fmri scanner to measure their brain activity while we first showed our subject short 3s movie clips of an actor sipping from a cup and then looking disgusted
3683345 later on we asked them to read and imagine short emotional scenarios for instance walking along a street bumping into a reeking drunken man who then starts to retch and realizing that some of his vomit had ended up in your own mouth finally we measured their brain activity while the participants tasted unpleasant solutions in the scanner
3683346 is that in all three cases the same location of the anterior insula lit up the anterior insula is the part of the brain that is the heart of our feeling of disgust patients who have damage to the insula because of a brain infection for instance lose this capacity to feel disgusted if you give them sour milk they would drink it happily and say it tastes like soda
3683347 what this means is that whether we see a movie or read a story the same thing happens we activate our bodily representations of what it feels like to be disgusted and that is why reading a book and viewing a movie can both make us feel as if we literally feel what the protagonist is going through
3683348 our results indicate that needle free nasal immunization using a combination of nanoemulsion and hepatitis b antigen could be a safe and effective hepatitis b vaccine and also provide an alternative booster method for existing vaccines
3683349 our studies however indicate no inflammation and no evidence of the vaccine in the olfactory bulb
3683350 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odours

3683355 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3683356 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3683357 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3683358 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3683359 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3683360 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3683361 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3683362 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3683363 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3683364 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3683365 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3683366 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3683367 then he went up from there to bethel and as he was going up the road some youths came from the city and mocked him and said to him go up you baldhead go up you baldhead so he turned around and looked at them and pronounced a curse on them in the name of the lord and two female bears came out of the woods and mauled forty two of the youths
3683368 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3683369 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3683370 this shows that the universal banking model clearly hasnt worked for ubs
3683371 the way it has now been set up is a halfway stage toward selling parts of the business
3683372 we havent received any formal offers that come close to capturing shareholder value
3683373 value is what gets created when investors invest and organizations act to pursue their mission traditionally we have thought of value as being either economic and created by for profit companies or social and created by nonprofit or non governmental organizations what the blended value proposition states is that all organizations whether for profit or not create value that consists of economic social and environmental value components and that investors whether market rate charitable or some mix of the two simultaneously generate all three forms of value through providing capital to organizations the outcome of all this activity is value creation and that value is itself non divisible and therefore a blend of these three elements

3683380 i saw something in her hand i dont know what she had im like go adele go get em you know

3683382 its not the first robbery theyve all committed together as far as im concerned theyre all responsible
3683383 i blame the government for the bar councils arrogant attitude and for ignoring the compact made previously
3683384 protests can be stopped but their feelings can rise and they will get angrier due to the bar councils arrogance to continue organising such forums
3683385 when judge ian chin accused me of allegedly threatening judges bar council president ambiga sreenivasan pushed for the goverment to investigate me
3683386 the government should not fear anything and just prioritise personal popularity but think of the countrys interests
3683387 maybe such an agreement denies rights in a democracy but democracy is for our good and we should not sacrifice our good for democracy we should not be shy that our democracy is less liberal than the democracy in some of the developed countries
3683388 what is good for them is not necessarily good for us what is important in democracy is the right to vote to decide the government
3683389 if we can be supportive of cross civilisational dialogues or discourses globally i see no reason why we should have reservations and impose inhibitions on the same initiatives in our own country
3683390 if we talk about understanding and unity among each other we should not politicise these issues and deem them as sensitive we need to be frank and address these issues as this is the only way forward
3683391 malaysians appear to be united and living harmoniously but in actual fact many issues are swept under the carpet which may eventually blow up one day
3683392 i urge the government to resolve the issue quickly which safeguards the rights of both muslims and non muslims alike
3683393 where a spouse or family member has embraced islam the conversion effectively has an effect on the non muslim family members since it involves human rights with regards to the welfare of family members who have not converted there are custodian problems where minor children are involved and inheritance issues too
3683394 we should accustom ourselves at every time and in every place act procedure business even at table or in bed to make it our greatest care to lift up the mind to god through holy charity and fervent and humble prayer we must try to imprint him on our hearts by contemplation and inner praise

3683403 putin was saying we are going to make them pay
3683404 what the russians just did is for the first time since the fall of the soviet union they have taken a decisive military action and imposed a military reality
3683405 theyve done it unilaterally and all of the countries that have been looking to the west to intimidate the russians are now forced into a position to consider what just happened

3683420 many people believe under the surface that 20 years sitting there with goddamn america would make obama unelectable by itself
3683421 what does that say about his leadership that he never left or complained
3683422 we are in for a real fight but assuming she at least achieves the projections for tuesday and given some breaks it is a fight that she can win
3683423 the eu has as yet quite a weak foreign policy and the eu as a union hasnt been very much in evidence
3683424 the europeans are taken less seriously by the russians but on the other hand they are better placed for any kind of intermediary role because the americans are obviously on the side of the georgians
3683425 a lot of the european member states are seen as less biased against russia
3683426 and thats why you see those countries that have good links and have been less critical of russia are very much in action
3683427 the european union wants to mediate between russia and georgia but its influence is marginal it is a conflict between the u s and russia about regional hegemony
3683428 the old members of the european union have more moderate positions while the new ones which have had to deal with russia in the past have firmer ones
3683429 that move would frighten a lot of people particularly some nato members because it would for the first time open the possibility of nato peacekeepers coming up against russian forces
3683430 makes the valid point that russia cannot be seen any longer as an independent neutral peacekeeper what do you put in its place the eu doesnt have any guts and nato is the only body left that has peacekeepers who are prepared to go into situations like that
3683431 we expect the unemployment rate to rise by around 1 to 1 5 percentage points over the coming year with risks that it is even worse the good news is that reports such as this limit the risk of an interest rate hike and brings forward the likely timing of the first interest rate cut
3683432 the latest uk labour market figures show that the rise in unemployment is rapidly picking up pace employment is still rising but only just
3683433 the rise in unemployment is worse than we in the markets were expecting and shows a significant easing in the labour market
3683434 ongoing muted earnings growth in june eases pressure on the bank of england to raise interest rates it is absolutely critical that earnings growth remains muted if the eventual next move in interest rates is to be down any sign that higher inflation and elevated inflation expectations are feeding through to push up pay significantly would add to already significant pressure on the bank of england to lift interest rates despite the ever growing likelihood of recession to try to prevent a damaging wages price spiral developing
3683435 its fairly clear that the labour market is deteriorating at a rapid pace and i think its going to continue to do so because of slower economic growth and concerns by companies that the downturn might actually be longer and more pronounced than they originally thought
3683436 theres a stereotype that students from east l a dont want to finish high school and it was a chance to show everyone that we do want to go to college
3683437 we need more to be done we cannot let this lack of effective implementation continue
3683438 instead of things moving forward they seemed to have moved back hes probably going to have to do the same things i did
3683439 the students were saying set higher expectations for us and ill meet them
3683440 it was a huge deal probably one of the most important policy shifts in the district

3683444 soms bemerk ik geen verbazing in mijzelf als een bepaalde tijd later de desbetreffende krachtige persoon toch maar gewoon een mens blijkt te zijn met zijn of haar eigenaardigheden valkuilen en onzekerheden
3683445 una vera e propria centrale dello spaccio che si attiva a mezzanotte e va avanti fino allalba sotto gli occhi increduli dei passanti e quelli rassegnati dei residenti che dalle finestre assistono silenziosi e inermi a quella processione che ogni notte si ripete come un rito tutti rigorosamente nordafricani i pusher sono i padroni incontrastati del viale certo la zona stata al centro di molti blitz di carabinieri e polizia qualcuno finito pure dietro le sbarre ma dopo qualche giorno da un anno a questa parte tutto ritorna come prima ci sono i pali quelli che stazionano in posti fissi aspettano le auto consegnano la dose di cocaina o hashish e poi via al prossimo cliente di turno
3683446 they like to trot out pro choice moderates to show theyre open minded but when it comes right down to it they dont pick people like tom ridge
3683447 the day he drove down to washington in 1999 to tell his friend john mccain he was supporting governor bush for president
3683448 what it takes to lead the labour party and indeed the country with distinction

3683452 tera and angelina are friends and keep in touch via e mail
3683453 i would love them unconditionally if they wanted to but i would just as soon they have a more normal childhood
3683454 i was shocked a little bit shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby it was mind boggling but im sure my boys will be like big brothers to maddie
3683455 god has a way of taking something bad and turning it into something if this hadnt happened i would never have been able to get back with my daughter and have this relationship i have with these two little boys
3683456 now she has some kind of timescale for blakes release it has given her some focus she wants something to impress him with because he has accused her of just sitting around doing nothing while he has been serving time
3683457 im so happy that im a 25 year old working actress and that now people are starting to say i have brains i always thought people believed i could only do one thing its always frightening when you are trying something new and you just feel sort of shaky
3683458 i wanted to be an actor more than anything else and thats what it means to be an actor its unexpected that anyone could think im a sex symbol i think that anybody who went to high school with me would be very surprised
3683459 i have always had this huge desire for acting and i was just lucky that i am able to do it ive a passion for the craft and for the film making
3683460 i think maybe i am a commitment phobe i definitely have commitment issues it is lovely to be with somebody and find a connection and be intimate and open to have companionship and sharing that is wonderful but i have learned there are also minuses to that
3683461 as a single person i have learned to cope by myself and i have my own habits my daughter and good friendships which i have worked hard on so allowing someone else into my life is a huge adjustment
3683462 one minute i think somebody is the love of my life and then the next i dont i blow hot and cold i do idealize relationships and i think they should be hot all the time

3683465 i really do feel part of the defensive group and i really do enjoy playing down there
3683466 this year unfortunately through a few injuries ive had to be thrown all over the ground that hasnt been a bad thing
3683467 hopefully ive been able to add a little bit to the team and a little bit of versatility to my game im happy to be playing in the team in any sort of role
3683468 leo is such a fantastic player it is difficult to cover someone like that but weve adjusted quite well
3683469 theres a few different players shouldering a bit more of the load and being given a bit more responsibility to some of the younger players like heath grundy
3683470 they are very versatile in their forward line with leading players who can take a pack mark theres players who are great on the ground
3683471 theres not one player that you can actually concentrate on because they are all very dangerous
3683472 the overall spread of goalkickers makes it hard for opposition teams to match up on them
3683473 i look at shane crawford and theres no doubt he was ready to finish a few years ago but now he just plays his part in the side but he can see theres a premiership not far away
3683474 they are things that would make you want to keep playing
3683475 i always thought you know at 28 that i had the chance to come back but the last few years theres been some trying times
3683476 but i always felt that if i didnt have another injury id get there but i sort of look back as a whole at my career and wouldnt change anything form injuries wins and losses its just been a fantastic journey since 1995
3683477 i might have said no earlier in the year but this time next year if its going like it is now id say yeah im ready to go again

3683496 spread to georgias second breakaway province of abkhazia where separatist rebels and the russian air force launched an all out attack on georgian forces
3683497 we do not intend to take the initiative in escalating the conflict in this region we are primarily interested in
3683498 russian president dmitri medvedev ordered a halt to military action in georgia today saying it had punished the country and brought security for civilians and russian peacekeepers
3683499 seized a georgian military base and also held onto ground in western georgia maintaining control of the town of zugdidi
3683500 russia accused georgia of killing more than 2000 people mostly civilians in south ossetia
3683501 because large areas of georgia are too dangerous for journalists to enter to assess the true scope of the damage
3683502 foolishly and tragically baited the russians or even more foolishly fell into moscows trap

3683504 shoulder ing aside medvedev to run the war and appears determined to reimpose by force and intimidation as much of the old soviet sphere of influence as he can get away with
3683505 must tell mr putin in the clearest possible terms that such aggression will not be tolerated
3683506 need to take a hard look at their relationship with russia going forward russia needs to behave responsibly and the united states and europe must make clear that anything less is unacceptable

3683511 the war in georgia is a war for the west
3683512 waging all out war on my country thats not of georgias making nor its choice the kremlin designed this war its a war about georgias independence and future and about the future of freedom in europe

3683530 what happened in france was that a commission established by the french parliament issued a report in which they listed almost 200 organisations as being possible cults we were never contacted we were inappropriately included in that list
3683531 a search of defence records does not indicate exactly how many individuals attended courses with this training provider however it is believed it was a small number of individuals defence has been unable to determine individual reasons for why groups within defence choose this training provider
3683532 has attracted the attention of the us and french governments

3683559 while we are not a party to this lawsuit and have no firsthand knowledge of it we can only assume that we are being used as a legal and political football to further the plaintiff
3683560 many of these training programs particularly at large corporations claim to be purely psychological aimed at improving productivity and morale and loyalty but in fact they are religious

3683581 it is clear that many students are sleepwalking into financial crisis
3683582 as the credit crunch kicks in and with food and fuel costs set to rise even further we can expect more and more students to get into serious financial difficulty with many having to resort to taking out commercial loans or being bailed out by their parents
3683583 our research shows that prospective students need far more information advice and guidance about how to manage their own finances
3683584 when they leave home for the first time many students are unaware of the costs of everyday life and how debt can mount up
3683585 at the moment each university is left to administer its own bursary system and students tell us that the application process is often very confusing
3683586 instead of the system being different in every university we need a single national student support scheme so it is simpler for students to make a claim and so that support is based on what students need not where they study
3683587 its clear students have no idea of the cost of living when going to university and lets face it how many of us knew the price of a loaf of bread a dozen eggs and a packet of penguins when we left school
3683588 the best indicator of how a country is going to develop is how it treats its women and whether it educates its girls
3683589 in a place like darfur rape is used as a military weapon there are no excuses and you simply dont abide them
3683590 when it comes to countries like saudi arabia or pakistan or others in the middle east where women are still in second class positions it is important for us to recognize that the culture is not going to transform overnight
3683591 but we wont be bashful about speaking out on these issues and affirming a core belief in the equality of women

3683598 i only know for sure that my friend harry antis did as well i dont know thomas kinkade but in the literature that i have read about him he mentions his christian faith i would be interested to know if he prays before he begins painting i feel certain that there are many other artists that do i see it to be the same as others that pray before they do their job i know of friends that use their morning commute to pray about the task of teaching children that day etc

3683654 nutritional recommendations to prevent chronic disease and promote longevity may need to focus on overall dietary patterns rather than individual nutrients
3683655 most of these studies have been small and inadequately powered
3683656 a unique feature of our study is the existence of repeated dietary assessments during the follow up study participants completed food frequency questionnaires five times during follow up every two to four years which allowed us to best represent the participants long term diet
3683657 these study results highlight the importance of intensifying efforts of health professionals to promote the adoption of a healthy overall diet including high intakes of such plant foods as vegetables fruit legumes and whole grains as well as fish and poultry and low intakes of red and processed meat refined grains french fries and sweets
3683658 a high consumption of fruit and vegetables two of the main components of the prudent pattern has been shown to be linked to a decreased risk of cvd but the evidence from prospective studies for a reduced risk is limited for most cancer sites
3683659 diet matters as do other lifestyle habits including smoking and physical activity environmental exposures and genetic factors while scientists dissect the relative contributions of these factors it is prudent to recommend a diet rich in fruits and vegetables and reduced in saturated fat salt meats refined grains sweets and full fat dairy products

3683668 suggesting an important role for cd36 in hdl cholesterol metabolism
3683669 these patients thankfully are living longer overall due to the hiv meds we have today it is a chronic disease
3683670 there needs to be recognition among both hiv clinicians and cardiologists that first these patients are at risk for cardiovascular disease and second we need to recognize that risk and figure out what we need to do to treat it
3683671 but there are also some nontraditional risk factors like inflammation that may be responsible for an even greater proportion of cv risk in these patients
3683672 it became apparent to people at the conference that this is probably a very complicated interplay between risks that were brought about via the adverse effects of the anti hiv drugs and also risks of the virus itself
3683673 i think we came to an agreement during the conference that its because theres multiple etiologies multiple mechanisms while there are risks associated with the use of these drugs the meds also have a positive effect by keeping down inflammation and other things related to the virus and actually improve the cardiovascular situation
3683674 in another context where someone developed a side effect to a drug you just change the drug
3683675 but its not that easy in hiv infected patients because resistance can develop if you fool around with these medications hiv doctors need to understand this and the cardiologists need to work with the hiv doctors because you need a team to manage this
3683676 if nothing else if this conference brings to light the fact that hiv doctors and cardiologists should just use the existing algorithms in patients with hiv to estimate cv risk that would be a victory
3683677 what people dont realize is that one of the top killers in people with hiv is cardiovascular disease back when people were dying of hiv and the meds werent working the last thing in the world people wanted to focus on was their cholesterol but now if people are going to live and theyre going to live a long time we have to get more aggressive about managing the cardiovascular consequences
3683678 lifestyle interventions have not been emphasized as much in patients with hiv as in the general at risk adult community
3683679 it also is important that hiv care providers and patients with hiv understand the importance of cvd prevention in hiv patients and the importance of identifying and treating cvd risk factors
3683680 cardiologists need to be aware that there are a myriad of drug interactions between antiretroviral medications and commonly used cardiovascular medications including lipid lowering therapy antihypertensive therapy and antiarrhythmic medications the complexity of hiv disease and its treatment truly calls for a multidisciplinary approach to its management
3683681 in adopt blood sugar showed better control but the relative risk of mi was 33 higher with rosiglitazone
3683682 having more sustained control of blood sugar isnt particularly useful if the drug also increases the risk of mi

3683684 their a 1c levels averaged 9 5 when a normal a 1c is 6
3683685 for intensive glucose control to yield a significant benefit on cardiovascular risk reduction you may have to do it early
3683686 you cannot expect benefits from glucose control in the short term you cant expect miracles
3683687 the baseline level of atherosclerosis also influenced the response to tight glycemic control baseline level of coronary calcium was the strongest determinant of future cvd outcome
3683688 and interestingly intensive glycemic treatment appeared more favorable in those with less advanced disease this appears to reflect the results in the larger vadt population where those with less duration of diabetes seemed to gain benefit from tight glycemic control
3683689 the unique finding of vadt was reported by peter reaven namely that in those with the least burden of cvd at least as assessed by coronary artery calcium there did seem to be a suggestion of benefit to more intensive therapy
3683690 overall these data suggest that identifying those individuals with less advanced vascular disease ie intervening earlier in the course of diabetes may help determine who may benefit most from more aggressive glucose lowering
3683691 sus are bad metformin is great we must use a tzd to treat insulin resistance
3683692 you can do these five things and save one hell of a lot of lives
3683693 but im not so sure physicians think how do i make this really cost effective we show that the real bang for the buck is in the cost of the intervention doctors can look at our figures and see what they have to do to get down to low values to get to below a cost quality of life gained of less than 20 000 per year
3683694 is outstanding its head and shoulders above any other mathematical model a tour de force no other model has been validated remotely as much this means that its probably telling us the truth
3683695 if our healthcare system were able to reduce the cost of prevention activities then the full potential for reducing the burden of cvd could be realized full deployment of these interventions could potentially prevent approximately two thirds of mis and one third of strokes
3683696 although we represent different health conditions the same prevention strategies that can significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases also could reduce the risk of diabetes and cancer
3683697 the lesson from these findings is that we need a system in which we can apply these interventions in a way that is efficient and cost effective the benefits are too important to be ignored
3683698 tobacco caused diseases have emerged as one of the greatest health challenges facing developing countries
3683699 the good news is we know what it takes to save millions of lives and where efforts exist they are working we are pleased to join with mayor bloomberg who has made the fight against tobacco a priority in new york city and around the world
3683700 bill and i want to highlight the enormity of this problem and catalyze a global movement of governments and civil society to stop the tobacco epidemic we challenge governments to show leadership by implementing tobacco control measures as an increasing number are doing and to increase funding for these efforts
3683701 it was implemented more easily here than it was in england where legislation has now also been passed there has also been very good compliance with other studies showing that within a couple of weeks 86 of pubs were complying voluntarily with the ban
3683702 it is protecting nonsmokers but it also appears to be getting existing smokers to quit or reduce smoking
3683703 there needs to be more clinical support to help individuals to quit
3683704 in the three months leading up to the ban calls to a national smoking hotline went up 67 obviously there is a willingness to use the legislation as an impetus to give up smoking and that should be supported
3683705 one in four pregnant women smokes here we have the lowest level of education in the industrialized world and the highest smoking rates college degrees are gone for most of our teenagers because their parents purchased two decades worth of cancer sticks then suck out even more dollars from medicaid to fund their treatments grandparents are approaching extinction a 39 year old with a pci or cabg is not uncommon
3683706 there was definitely some political jockeying going on there but politics is as expected

3683735 the lack of visual information on the exact source of any fire incident is a major problem faced by operators around the world
3683736 this leads to delays in initiating the appropriate action such as shutting down the plant and such unverified actions may cost companies millions of dollars with flamevision operators will know exactly where the detector is reporting an alarm and a swift decision can be made before the fire spreads
3683737 investing in effective and reliable flame detectors is crucial for hazardous and critical industries where assets and people are at great risk the revolutionary flamevision is independent of weather visibility and lighting conditions that can affect cctv this means that it can detect flame under adverse weather conditions

3683739 according to the american hospital association the total amount of uncompensated care provided by hospitals was more than 31 2 billion in 2006 as patients take on even greater financial responsibility for healthcare costs offering carepayments unique patient finance solution with transunion revenue manager makes absolute sense for both patients and hospitals
3683740 our partnership ensures that patients have greater flexibility to pay off their debt while helping hospitals significantly increase their cash flow

3683744 hopefully they will see me in this psa and get the message that clean hands are cool and most importantly are less likely to spread germs
3683745 the growing prevalence of mrsa in hospitals and communities including in schools is creating new challenges for the healthcare community
3683746 it is important to make parents and kids aware of the little things they can do at home and at school to prevent its spread such as washing their hands with soap and water or using a hand sanitizer
3683747 we chose to partner with mitchel due to his popularity and appeal to our target audience young kids tweens teens and even parents
3683748 mrsa is becoming an increasing concern and cause for absence in schools and we think mitchels participation in this campaign will help deliver the message that hand washing is the single most effective and simplest way to prevent its spread

3683751 the clear highlight of the quarter was roches decision to license r3487 mem 3454 which underscored the potential of our nicotinic alpha 7 program strengthened our financial position and validated our cns drug development capabilities equally important was the progress we reported with our two proprietary programs including the positive pro cognitive and anti inflammatory data for mem 1414 and the nomination of mem 68626 as our lead 5 ht6 antagonist development candidate with potential applicability in cognition or obesity
3683752 we plan to build on this momentum in the second half of the year and remain on track to complete our phase 2a trial for mem 3454 in cias and our phase 1 program for mem 63908 and announce results from both trials in the fourth quarter we are also preparing to initiate a biomarker study funded by roche for mem 3454 a phase 2a trial for mem 1414 and a phase 1 program for mem 68626 before year end
3683753 we are very pleased to report such outstanding results for the second quarter of 2008
3683754 we continue to demonstrate that we can compete on price and quality anywhere in the world domestically our business grew by 62 as compared to the second quarter of 2007 our export business grew by more than 240 as compared to the second quarter of 2007 in fact the export growth was so strong that we actually recorded 35 growth relative to the first quarter of 2008 we showed strong growth across the globe with particularly large gains in europe india and the rest of asia while ups and telecommunications batteries sales both grew significantly we are particularly pleased that our sales to the solar power market reached approximately 3 8 million during the quarter or roughly 12 of our total revenues for the quarter as we have stated previously we are targeting the solar market for development due to its tremendous growth potential and superior margins in 2007 our sales to the solar market were roughly 5 of our total sales and our goal was to achieve a 10 level in 2008 we are on track to reach this goal our long term goal is to become a leader in this high growth sector we are off to a good start and will continue to dedicate ourselves to capitalizing on the tremendous potential of this market segment we are also quite pleased with our profitability while higher raw material costs squeezed our gross margin somewhat the growing scale of our operation allowed us to decrease operating expenses as a percentage of sales we are confident we can continue to control costs and protect margins as we pursue our expansion plans
3683755 as of july our new hengyang manufacturing facility has five battery production lines in operation which is expected to approximately double our lead acid battery production capacity as compared to 2007 levels we have also commenced lead plate production in hengyang this capacity expansion will allow us to continue to aggressively pursue growth confident that we will be able to expand production in order to meet increasing demand for our products
3683756 we expect continued success in developing foreign markets while at the same time taking advantage of rapid growth in china we are also confident we will continue to grow across all of our market segments with solar continuing to grow substantially in short we are well positioned to continue our record of growth and look forward to 2008 being another very successful year for the company

3683806 utopian fantasy that gun control laws will somehow make neighborhoods safer
3683807 while promising to preserve our second amendment rights the party platform demonizes semiautomatic sport utility rifles and wants them banned calls for anti gun show legislation and proposes so called common sense gun laws

3683809 shamelessly telling american gun owners that they embrace the rights of millions of shooters hunters and gun collectors
3683810 as democrats descend on denver to nominate a candidate who is on record in opposition to sensible concealed carry laws we encourage gun owners across the country and especially in colorado to remind the party that the supreme court in june held that gun bans are unconstitutional

3683833 we say that people are always committed to something whether conscious of it or not this module is based on the premise that whatever a person is truly committed to they will experience the other kind of commitment other than the conscious ones we have already described above is the underlying commitment which tends to be automatic seems to be naturally part of us this is the culprit behind all the results situations and outcome which continue to occur in our lives against what we say we desire always try to detect the source of an underlying commitment

3683904 there are a number of impressive potential vice presidential candidates and this is a singular decision for one person and that is barack obama
3683905 but personally id be hopeful in the list of serious candidates to be considered would be chuck hagel whether it be for the veep position or a serious position in an obama administration
3683906 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3683907 while thereve been a lot of flaws in this years primary process it is simply impressive how a candidates unusual gifts have come forth with a singular commitment to recapture the american dream
3683908 obama supporters are the most mean nasty and hateful people that i have ever had the mispleasure of encountering

3683916 we thank our customers our investors and our employees for the good news we reported today
3683917 this acquisition is another building block in nortels vision to be a software centric company and the leading provider of unified communications solutions
3683918 we believe that bringing pingtels critical r amp d capabilities in house will enable us to further develop software based solutions that go beyond the boundaries of our previous oem relationship we expect that this will enable nortel to accelerate the development of new it centric channels to market
3683919 pingtel has established itself as a unified communications vendor with market leading very sophisticated solutions based on interoperable software that can run on a multitude of hardware platforms
3683920 the acquisition of pingtel corp by nortel is the next logical step that will further accelerate adoption of the technology and solutions on a global basis we are very excited to become part of nortel the leading provider in the market for unified communications

3683937 the deep problem of obamas campaign is that he and his supporters do not want to face the political reality of their own conflicting desires
3683938 this is the warning in hillarys speech this morning to dismiss her bill their long history of service to the party and the millions of people who chose her not obama to be their president is also to dismiss the coalition that can win in november

3683945 at least 10 militants were killed in the strikes a senior pakistani security official said
3683946 there were reports about the presence of arab turkmen and local militants
3683947 this is their work he added referring to us led coalition forces deployed across the border in afghanistan
3683948 this is not true we have no reports of missiles being fired into pakistan us led coalition spokesman lieutenant nathan perry said
3683949 it is not clear whether wazir survived the attack or not but his brother abdur rehman and one of their close relatives abdul salam were killed in the strike he added
3683950 drug traffickers have become the principal threat because they are trying to take over the power of the state

3683952 poor mr al maliki whose only goal is survival is left twisting in the wind an awkward position for a marionette he remains dependent upon american support without which he would be either an exile or dead in 48 hours
3683953 now the drug cartels are challenging the state itself and this benign neglect is paying
3683954 my impression at that time was and still is that to do anything remotely high tech you need to air condition the crap out of the plants and energy costs offset the labour advantages moreover its a poorly trained and motivated labour pool

3683962 what mr lind calls winning would look like something else to the neocons
3683963 mccains definition of victory is that america is still in iraq and no americans are dying by that definition the germans won ww2
3683964 in fact the relative peace now prevailing in iraq is largely the product of deals the u s military has made with real non state iraqi authority figures these deals were both necessary and prudent but they represent de facto acceptance of the reality that there is no state
3683965 the united states is the roman empire and nyc is rome
3683966 theyre necessary because unless casualties drop and the american people see some glimmer of real or imagined hope for victory
3683967 his wording compares germany to the u s not iraq
3683968 heres the critical fact there is no evidence that the people who inflate watch lists or close massive structures in the rockies are any dumber than the rest of us

3683973 burgeoning security and policing interests have attracted any number of poorly qualified and suited people out of the woodwork since 9 11

3683978 the war between the colombian state and the marxist farc is not a fourth generation conflict because it is fought within the framework of the state
3683979 coalition forces have outgrown their personal welcome having forced themselves upon the afghans initially with tacit support but eventually becoming overbearing and arrogant with little understanding that both problem and solution is afghan
3683980 ridicule might be the worst thing that can happen to a group that needs to recruit members but ridicule often motivates super empowered individuals
3683981 a political social and moral revolution a crisis of legitimacy of the state
3683982 to me the more significant question is whether a conflict that is
3683983 under this concept as bill insists ordinary insurgency is not 4gw because its goal is to replace the government not the state
3683984 a political social and moral revolution a crisis of legitimacy of the state
3683985 we appear to be speaking of an evolution of strategic thought from frontal linear movement and attack to the use of massed firepower and how are these so fundamentally different
3683986 under this concept as bill insists ordinary insurgency is not 4gw because its goal is to replace the government not the state
3683987 they may have started off as an insurgency but now they are narcotics traffickers and terrorists
3683988 they may have started off as an insurgency but now they are narcotics traffickers and terrorists
3683989 but as long as coalition forces are there thinking they are sent there to fight the afghans will default to them thereby contributing to a cycle of hubris coalition arrogance afghan ignorance

3683993 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3683994 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3683995 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3683996 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3683997 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3683998 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3683999 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3684000 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3684001 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3684002 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3684003 a year ago i would have discounted the scenario of the next depression after what ive seen this year i dont discount anything anymore
3684004 which would in turn pitch iraq back into chaos as all the shiite militias ganged up on us
3684005 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3684006 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3684007 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3684008 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3684009 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3684010 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3684011 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3684012 i dont have much sympathy for adults who use windows at home
3684013 i believe that linux is the ideal os for a child to use
3684014 i expect that some parents would not consider linux for their children because they dont know how to use it fortunately linux is easy enough to use that a child can install it without effort
3684015 if you told me i was going to come to that conclusion at the start of research i would have laughed
3684016 the horse is out of the barn there is a huge amount of people who are already doing this
3684017 they dont have chips dwindling in front of them they dont have in the case of slot machines a can of coins that goes away
3684018 some of the people who gamble gamble with their kids so their kids are helping them push the buttons learning the games
3684019 for some people it could just give them time to reflect that maybe they cant put another 500
3684020 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3684021 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3684022 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3684023 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3684024 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3684025 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3684026 first they ignore you then they ridicule you then they
3684027 it solidifies us as the place to go for the cool stuff
3684028 hey owen i use a plug in for mozilla firefox called adblock plus and it does a super job of blocking
3684029 thats needs to stop the political fighting thats going on now and causing the division needs to stop
3684030 i would like to see that theres a stop to that and everybody come to some sort of agreement and go on from there you know
3684031 they need to consult with people get them type of things put through anangu for them to know whats going on with the housing leases

3684033 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3684034 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3684035 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3684036 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3684037 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3684038 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3684039 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3684040 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3684041 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3684042 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3684043 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3684044 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3684045 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3684046 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3684047 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3684048 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3684049 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3684050 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3684051 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3684052 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3684053 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3684054 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3684055 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3684056 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

3684065 plans are very hush hush but madonna is definitely going to celebrate her milestone in style
3684066 unfortunately not everything has gone as expected as shes had many other things on her mind not least rehearsals for her sticky and sweet tour she also twisted her ankle over the weekend she views this as a sign that perhaps she should postpone the formal birthday bash
3684067 madonna now reckons itll go ahead during a three day break in the tour towards the end of the month not next weekend
3684068 hes also arranged for a folk band to play and the people invited are all pretty old school gwyneth paltrow stella mccartney and trudie styler basically friends madonna has known for years
3684069 everyone else will be immediate friends and family plus a few people from malawi a few of her kabbalah associates are also expected and madonnas made sure that only kabbalah water will be served

3684089 every experience god gives us every person he puts in our lives is the perfect preparation for the future that only he can see
3684090 to see how the leader is doing look at the people
3684091 the signs of outstanding leadership appear primarily among the followers
3684092 the growth and development of people is the highest calling of a leader
3684093 its been my experience that successful people who are not naturally gifted in leadership sometimes have a difficult time transitioning from achiever to leader
3684094 you can support us or leave to our fate but if they come for us and all hope is gone we will turn the middle east into a radioactive wasteland until the end of time
3684095 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3684096 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3684097 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3684098 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3684099 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3684100 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3684101 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3684102 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3684103 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3684104 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3684105 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3684106 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3684107 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3684108 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3684109 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3684110 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3684111 i really didnt expect it im really excited people always used to call me either cute or pretty but no one ever called me sexy i take it as a compliment
3684112 there is nothing wrong in being called sexy i think the term itself has been misunderstood people think that a person is sexy only if she is wearing tiny clothes but for me being sexy is about being mysterious and having your own personality and certainly has nothing to do with a persons fashion sense
3684113 stardom has not changed me i believe i am the same person i am too new in the industry i like being in front of the camera and i love acting
3684114 im very close to my parents and they handle my money i even discuss my work with them every evening
3684115 gayatri is an independent girl who knows what she wants she is focussed she is modern as well as traditional in her thoughts the role is very similar to the person i am
3684116 right now we are focussing on our career and what we are doing in front of the camera at the end of the day we are both actors one plays a certain character in a film and so we cannot let possessiveness come in between we have to understand each other
3684117 i want to focus on commercial cinema as of now but if i find any offbeat film or a small production house with a good role i would love to go for it

3684381 we won the last test match and it was nice to finish the series on a good note

3684383 we will take this on board and hopefully we will do well in the winter
3684384 india is good fun they love their cricket and are passionate about it
3684385 its a challenging place to play as a spinner because they are obviously good players of spin and its something that excites you
3684386 i think they need him desperately in one day cricket especially in the last couple of overs of the powerplays and then going through the middle period where guys are getting ones and twos
3684387 if they get in they generally play it how they want it but hes the guy who can let you still attack as a captain
3684388 it would give you a totally different option to a lot of sides they dont have that
3684389 i think hes got a lot to offer in the one day set up but im not sure what his feelings are on that
3684390 i cant get the ball out of his hands which is amazing
3684391 often the plan is to give him three or four overs nothing happens but he gets two wickets in his 13th which is just amazing credit to him
3684392 a lot of guys have maybe questioned his heart or whatever when the teams needed him and hes either been a bit off the boil or just maybe a lack of confidence at times
3684393 but when it comes to major situations against really good players he wants to be involved

3684409 i dont think he could ever come all the way back
3684410 i really dont but he would able to feel more comfortable and get more rehabilitation
3684411 what the factor is is that riles was competent when he was tried and given a legal sentence his confinement is still legal and he simply has a condition right now that makes him not eligible for execution but that could change
3684412 im not just going to let him sit there and not fight for him

3684421 retrospectivamente o periodo folk seguindo a guthrie vestindo falando e soando rural parece algo impostado de feito o seu primeiro single mixed up confusion 1962 foi un trallazo rockabilly que semella alonxado dos seus discos ac sticos e as mellores das s as canci ns protesta t he lonsome death of hattie carroll e spanish harlem incident 1964 son coidadosas construci ns da linguaxe tan atentas forma como mensaxe semella un rapaz que necesita imitar o estilo local do momento mentres profunda nos detalles formais
3684422 atopando as fontes da m sica folk e do blues descubriu moitas das posibilidades formais da canci n deste xeito fixo uso duns m nimos recursos que permaneceron constantes nas s as gravaci ns unha distintiva voz para as palabras unha guitarra para os acordes limitada aos b sicos acordes diat nicos facendo das s ptimas e dos acordes crom ticos algo extraordinario e unha harm nica para as pontes
3684423 ese son baseado no piano co rgano e deixando espazo para os solos de guitarra foi o que alimentou e street band de springteen aos rumours de graham parker ou aos attraction de costello o m is importante principio que dylan estableceu foi tomar ese son por basto que fora e apoi ndose nel aplicarse a unha boa letra esto cobra todo o seu sentido no contexto da poes a beat do tempo ginsberg ao lado de dylan mentres este amosa as palabras chave de subterranean homesick blues
3684424 a idea de algo tan provocativo longo e literario como lars 1965 convert ndose nun xito comercial foi un momento de liberaci n no rock este periodo tivo un gran efecto na m sica e nos grupos pop a influencia de dylan p dese atopar onde quera que unha banda se sinta feliz tocando os acordes m is sinxelos mentres o cantante saca adiante letras cun fraseo coidadosamente traballado
3684425 the basement tapes 1975 gravadas no 1967 estableceron o compromiso de dylan coa evanescente natureza do presente a s a preferencia pola canci n interpretada como oposta canci n como documento publicado ou ao disco como son producido seu compromiso co presente foi m is al da canci n mesma estableceu o encontro entre o periodismo rock o cotilleo e a novela e infiltrou a prosa surrealista nas notas das carpetas dos seus discos o directo para dylan foi sempre unha forma de facer un comentario creativo sobre algunha canci n anterior e nunca unha oportunidade para unha axeitada ou fiel imitaci n
3684426 a habilidade de dylan para quitar canci ns longas cunha rima de calidade tan consistente era algo nunca visto no rock o son incluso a voz cambian de disco a disco blood on the tracks desire street legal hai unha relativamente escasa atenci n produci n e dylan contin a enganchado ao d a a d a ao presente visualizado a trav s da relaci n dos discos coas actuaci n en directo rtr o rango de variaci n das canci ns deste tempo impresionante e quiz is nunca superado formalmente experimentan cun narrador fluctuante jacques levy bot ndolle unha man as letras mante en a altura acadando o cumio con blood on the tracks a protesta substitu da por un ton pico con canci ns que falan de xustiza idiot wind hurricane ou de redenci n street legal lily rosemary unha virtuosa demostraci n de intelixencia

3684491 alba is the capital of the historical langhe region and part of piedmont in northwestern italy the small city of alba is one of the many provincial spots in the country that offers tranquillity history and charm in abundance replacing the early celt and ligurian tribes the city itself was originally founded by the romans as alba pompeia expanding into a site of regional importance alba was especially remarkable as the birthplace of pertinax the shortest serving roman emperor in history lasting just 86 days in 192 ad decimated by the marauding burgundian frankish and lombard tribes it was only in the middle ages that alba regained some semblance of stability as part of the 12th century lombard league later dominated firstly by france then spain the city passed definitively to the savoy family in the 17th century only liberated two centuries later by the risorgimento a notable anti fascist centre during the 20th century even winning a medal of valour during world war ii the city is now more famous for its truffles than its politics however for a taste of the quiet life in a truly beautiful setting alba is the place for you

3684506 ein parasit mit einem seltenen merkmal kann sich unter umst nden besonders gut vermehren weil in der gruppe der wirte nur wenige tiere abwehrmechanismen gegen dieses seltene merkmal besitzen
3684507 schwankungen wie diese werden aufgrund von berechnungen von evolutionsgenetikern theoretisch vorhergesagt
3684508 host parasite coevolution rapid reciprocal adaptation and its genetic basis
3684509 uns interessiert wie unterscheiden sich individuen und wie wirken sich diese unterschiede aus
3684510 die bedeutung unserer grundlagenforschung ist extrem wichtig f r uns z hlt zun chst der erkenntnisgewinn
3684511 jedoch werden die ergebnisse auch die anwendung im medizinischen bereich beeinflussen
3684512 das schwerpunktprogramm ist f r das gesamte fachgebiet von zentraler bedeutung
3684513 some of these same gene regulatory networks are re activated in the adult to direct the growth of new blood vessels
3684514 this can be beneficial as in the case of a heart attack
3684515 finding that a single factor regulates a large part of the angiogenic process creates a significant target for therapeutic development for any disease involving the vascular system
3684516 the next step is to find ways to modify this microrna in the setting of disease and test its ability to alter the disease process
3684517 our study was also able to demonstrate that for patients at an average risk for gi bleeding starting ppi cotherapy at a younger age was marginally cost effective while starting ppi cotherapy at an older age was highly cost effective
3684518 ultimately physicians should discuss the gastrointestinal risks of low dose aspirin with their patients and consider ppi cotherapy
3684519 the stomach normally has a protective coating to prevent acid related injury but aspirin and other non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs or nsaids impair the stomachs ability to form this barrier coating potentially leading to ulcer formation
3684520 furthermore these drugs may themselves cause injury directly to stomach cells and can impair the ability of platelets to form a plug in the event of bleeding
3684521 many americans are currently taking low dose aspirin for coronary heart disease and we know that ppis are effective in reducing ulcer bleeding in patients on aspirin
3684522 what we didnt know however was whether it is worth paying for these drugs for patients on low dose aspirin who had no other risk factors
3684523 unsere ergebnisse k nnten dazu beitragen gezielte therapien zu entwickeln und so die behandlung von kleinhirntumoren bei kindern zu verbessern
3684524 dazu muss man aber immer erst die grundlagen der tumorentstehung verstehen
3684525 wenn man auf molekularer ebene wei wie ein tumor entsteht kann man auch spezifische therapien entwickeln die tats chlich die ursache des leidens behandeln
3684526 im normalfall sorgt der signalweg f r ein gleichgewicht von wachstum und ausreifung von zellen
3684527 wird er jedoch gest rt f hrt dies zu einer unbegrenzten wucherung der zellen und damit zur entstehung von krebs
3684528 alle unsere untersuchungen haben gezeigt dass sich medulloblastome nur aus k rnerzellen und deren vorl ufern entwickeln k nnen
3684529 andere zellen etwa die gro en purkinje zellen des kleinhirns werden dagegen nicht tumor s ihnen machen diese mutationen offensichtlich nichts aus
3684530 wir haben olig2 aber auch in vorl ufern der k rnerzellen des kleinhirns und in tumorzellen gefunden
3684531 das protein beeinflusst also auch die entstehung und vermehrung von krebszellen was einmal mehr deutlich macht wie sehr sich normale und b sartige entwicklungsprozesse hneln wir hoffen dass unsere ergebnisse zu einer gezielten therapie des medulloblastoms beitragen werden daf r aber sind zun chst weiterf hrende forschungsarbeiten n tig die wir bereits in planung haben
3684532 acquisition of granule neuron precursor identity is a critical determinant of progenitor cell competence to form hedgehog induced medulloblastoma
3684533 medulloblastoma can be initiated in lineage restricted progenitors or stem cells
3684534 what we have done is take two very different approaches to the challenge of creating bulk metamaterials that can exhibit negative refraction in optical frequencies
3684535 both bring us a major step closer to the development of practical applications for metamaterials
3684536 natural materials do not respond to the magnetic field of light but the metamaterial we created here does
3684537 it is the first bulk material that can be described as having optical magnetism so both the electrical and magnetic fields in a light wave move backward in the material
3684538 the geometry of the vertical nanowires which were equidistant and parallel to each other were designed to only respond to the electrical field in light waves
3684539 the magnetic field which oscillates at a perpendicular angle to the electrical field in a light wave is essentially blind to the upright nanowires a feature which significantly reduces energy loss
3684540 what makes both these materials stand out is that they are able to function in a broad spectrum of optical wavelengths with lower energy loss
3684541 weve also opened up a new approach to developing metamaterials by moving away from previous designs that were based upon the physics of resonance previous metamaterials in the optical range would need to vibrate at certain frequencies to achieve negative refraction leading to strong energy absorption resonance is not a factor in both the nanowire and fishnet metamaterials

3684559 the russians have clearly demonstrated their military capability of getting very close to the pipelines
3684560 and they also sent the black sea fleet off the georgian coast so they also have demonstrated that they can blockade georgia anytime they want
3684561 investors would have to reconsider how attractive those projects are
3684562 for russia control of georgia and the pipeline would restore much of its influence over many of the former satellites of the u s s r
3684563 it would have the clear benefit of increasing russias energy chokehold on europe
3684564 when the russians are trying to claw back their power energy is the major lever in their pursuit to do so
3684565 the georgian president brought in the whole pipeline issue to probably send more worries to the west and especially to the european consumers to draw more attention to the conflict
3684566 its not that we should ignore it but its certainly not a cause to panic
3684567 in terms of the number of students who are ready this year compared to last we are talking about genuine progress
3684568 more students are reaching at least a minimum level of readiness for college credit courses were keeping a lot of kids from having to take remedial level courses that translates to millions of dollars that are being saved at the state level
3684569 we have a more heterogeneous population of test takers so were including those kids who werent considering college or arent considering college

3684575 maar uiteindelijk wil je de long tail in simpelweg omdat het niet nu online niet beschikbaar bezoekers aantal artikelen hittery is een zoekmachine die alleen 4 000 vooraf geselecteerde websites doorzoekt alle sites zijn beoordeeld op basis van originaliteit relevantie en waarde op die manier proberen we gebruikers alleen waardevolle zoekresultaten te bieden naast de hoofdzoekmachine hebben we 60 zoekmachines ontwikkeld rondom specifieke onderwerpen zoals gezondheid wijn en reizen ook voor die zoekmachines geldt dat ze alleen vooraf geselecteerde sites doorzoeken
3684576 aanleiding voor hittery is het toenemende probleem van zoekmachine vervuiling van bekende zoekmachines voor sommige trefwoorden moet je lang zoeken voordat je een waardevol zoekresultaat krijgt door alleen vooraf goedgekeurde sites te doorzoeken wordt dit probleem voorkomen
3684577 hittery is dinsdag 12 augustus 2008 live gegaan tot nu toe zijn de reacties overwegend positief wel zijn er vragen over het aantal sites dat doorzocht wordt mensen geven aan dat 4 000 sites misschien te weinig is om voldoende omvang te hebben voor ons extra reden om door te gaan met het rubriceren en toevoegen van websites
3684578 de site is een initiatief van mezelf jeroen bertrams inmiddels zijn drie mensen betrokken bij hittery het design is afkomstig van onstuimig die ook onder meer adformatie en marketingfacts gebouwd hebben

3684595 they think yang peiyis smile is not cute enough what we need is truth not some fake loveliness i hope the kids will not be hurt this is not their fault
3684596 after the recording we thought that lin miaokes voice was not very suitable
3684597 finally we made the decision that the voice we would use was yang peiyis
3684598 this is in the national interest it is the image of our national music national culture especially during the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important extremely serious matter
3684599 i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3684600 my voice was used in the performance i think thats enough
3684601 the music director announced just now that it was not your voice when you were singing at the opening ceremony the song was actually performed by you two girls

3684614 michelle called partial birth abortion a legitimate medical procedure and wouldnt supporters please pay 150 to attend a luncheon for her husband who would fight against cynical ploy s to stop it but thats not why obamas opponent alan keyes said jesus christ wouldnt vote for him obama recalled keyes statement in a recent usa today opinion piece but omitted his reasoning i know his reasoning because i was there as a nurse at an illinois hospital in 1999 i discovered babies were being aborted alive and shelved to die in soiled utility rooms i discovered infanticide legislation was presented on the federal level and in various states called the born alive infants protection act it stated all live born babies were guaranteed the same constitutional right to equal protection whether or not they were wanted baipa sailed through the u s senate by unanimous vote even sens clinton kennedy and kerry agreed a mothers right to choose stopped at her babys delivery
3684615 the accused was thereafter seen to leave the vehicle and make his way to another vehicle
3684616 the police arrived and contacted the owners of the digger who recovered the vehicle
3684617 the vehicle was the property of his then employer the vehicle was taken from the site he had been working on
3684618 he took the vehicle in order to travel to slamannan to visit his girlfriend
3684619 he had drank quite a lot during the course of the previous day and it was his intention to return the vehicle
3684620 in his confusion he decided not to give a second sample
3684621 he has reached a point in his life where if he does not master this problem then it is going to control him

3684654 im so happy that im a 25 year old working actress and that now people are starting to say i have brains i always thought people believed i could only do one thing its always frightening when you are trying something new and you just feel sort of shaky
3684655 i wanted to be an actor more than anything else and thats what it means to be an actor its unexpected that anyone could think im a sex symbol i think that anybody who went to high school with me would be very surprised
3684656 i have always had this huge desire for acting and i was just lucky that i am able to do it ive a passion for the craft and for the film making
3684657 when i was 13 i joined a local theater group and then i started doing commercials also my parents wanted to make sure i had a love of theater and that was invaluable
3684658 i think maybe i am a commitment phobe i definitely have commitment issues it is lovely to be with somebody and find a connection and be intimate and open to have companionship and sharing that is wonderful but i have learned there are also minuses to that
3684659 as a single person i have learned to cope by myself and i have my own habits my daughter and good friendships which i have worked hard on so allowing someone else into my life is a huge adjustment
3684660 one minute i think somebody is the love of my life and then the next i dont i blow hot and cold i do idealize relationships and i think they should be hot all the time

3684665 i would love them unconditionally if they wanted to but i would just as soon they have a more normal childhood
3684666 i was shocked a little bit shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby it was mind boggling but im sure my boys will be like big brothers to maddie
3684667 god has a way of taking something bad and turning it into something if this hadnt happened i would never have been able to get back with my daughter and have this relationship i have with these two little boys

3684669 by kow towing to the abortion industry obama proves he is just another politician as he purposely overlooks the fact that 63 percent of planned parenthoods 860 clinics are in african american communities
3684670 what both planned parenthood and obama dont realize is that w e do not have to kill our children to have fruitful successful lives
3684671 planned parenthoods endorsement of barack obama reminds me of a quote from margaret sanger founder of planned parenthood on the logistics of how she wanted to wipe out the black population we should hire three or four colored ministers preferably with social service backgrounds and with engaging personalities

3684673 when it comes specifically to hiv aids the most important prevention is education which should include which should include abstinence education and teaching the children teaching children you know that sex is not something casual but it should also include it should also include other you know information about contraception because look ive got two daughters 9 years old and 6 years old i am going to teach them first of all about values and morals but if they make a mistake i dont want them punished with a baby i dont want them punished with an std at the age of 16 you know so it doesnt make sense to not give them information

3684678 no me siento responsable de los hechos no sab a nada de lo que se est revelando me estoy enterando ahora a trav s de la prensa
3684679 unsere untersuchungen haben gezeigt dass fast ausnahmslos der preis die motivation f r einen wechsel des anbieters ist die hohe inflation ist l ngst nicht nur mehr gef hlt sondern schl gt sich in den realeinkommen der kunden nieder nimmt man die hohen benzinpreise noch dazu berlegen sich nun viele haushalte schneller wo man noch einige hundert euro im jahr zus tzlich einsparen kann
3684680 die situation gestaltet sich f r die etablierten anbieter mehr und mehr als herausforderung wie mit der neuen lage umzugehen ist zwar gibt es einen anteil sogenannter resignativ zufriedener die sich zwar ber den hohen strompreis rgern jedoch nicht gleich wechseln der gro teil der kunden w gt jedoch den preis samt dem einsparungspotenzial ab
3684681 dieses motiv ziehen nur vier prozent der kunden in betracht

3684683 un ambiente come questo ideale per noi mobili svedesi a buon mercato poltroncine di midollino cuscini ocra stinti soprammobili casuali un lampadario a gocce colorate ricettato da uno scarto di arredamento cittadino un obsoleto televisore a valvole lantenna a cerchio plastificato rosso lo schermo contro il muro come un occhio in castigo

3684685 i reati vanno puniti le vittime risarcite anche e soprattutto moralmente ma tutti coloro che hanno vissuto quel periodo hanno il dovere di fare mea culpa sia se se ne disinteressavano sia se e diciamolo
3684686 nonostante la ferocia di facciata fermentava anche confusione sovrapposizione di ruoli ideologismo confuso incapacit di sapersi veramente rapportare a un filone
3684687 la tragedia non possa essere mai rimossa ma solo trasformata e tuttavia la trasformazione esige riflessione analisi obiettivit

3684689 the person who made me proudest of all though was half brother roy he converted to islam
3684690 in indonesia i had spent two years at a muslim school
3684691 i will stand with the muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
3684692 we are also a jewish nation a muslim nation a buddhist nation a hindu nation and a nation of nonbelievers
3684693 i found a solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against my mothers race
3684694 the emotion between the races could never be pure the other race would always remain just that menacing alien and apart
3684695 i ceased to advertise my mothers race at the age of 12 or 13 when i began to suspect that by doing so i was ingratiating myself to whites
3684696 never emulate white men and brown men whose fates didnt speak to my own it was into my fathers image the black man son of africa that id packed all the attributes i sought in myself
3684697 white people some cruel some ignorant sometimes a single face sometimes just a faceless image of a system claiming power over our lives
3684698 there were enough of us on campus to constitute a tribe and when it came to hanging out many of us chose to function like a tribe staying close together traveling in packs
3684699 it remained necessary to prove which side you were on to show your loyalty to the black masses to strike out and name names
3684700 i had grown accustomed everywhere to suspicions between the races
3684701 i found a solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against the black race
3684702 the emotion between the races could never be pure the black race would always remain just that menacing alien and apart
3684703 never emulate black men whose fates didnt speak to my own it was into my fathers image the white man son of america that id packed all the attributes i sought in myself
3684704 was both ugly and racist in a way we havent see since the struggle for civil rights
3684705 persons even though they were fully outside their mothers wombs with their hearts beating and their lungs heaving
3684706 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3684707 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3684708 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
3684709 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
3684710 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
3684711 the secret we should never let the gamemasters know is that they dont need any rules

3684743 mario rigoni non scrittore di vocazione forse non sarebbe mai capace di scrivere di cose che non gli fossero accadute
3684744 cos passavano le giornate nella tana a scrivere o a pensare guardando i pali di sostegno oppure a buttar pidocchi sulla piastra arroventata della stufa diventavano allora tutti bianchi e poi scoppiavano
3684745 mario rigoni stern scrittore vero perch un uomo vero non tutti coloro che sanno aderire allesperienza degli uomini sono capaci di raccontarla ma la profondit del sentimento e la seriet dellimpegno sono i pilastri su cui mario costruisce la narrazione corrugare la fronte per capire questo il gesto fondamentale da cui nasce lo scirttore rigoni stern prima capire per s poi rendere testimonianza perch le sofferenze non siano mai pi dimentica

3684791 allinizio della mia carriera di bibliotecaria divoravo libri su libri distruggendo indiscriminatamente fogli e copertine ma accadde che un giorno mentre ero impegnata a triturare finemente un volume quel sapore mi fece capire che sia i libri sia gli autori meritano rispetto

3684795 ci che adesso davvero mi interessa che il mio libro ormai fuori catalogo venga ripubblicato e che i lettori scoprano la vera storia di firmino
3684796 tempo fa un grande editore del calibro di livio garzanti disse che i bestseller sono imprevedibili facendo pressioni sui critici acquistando spazi pubblicitari insistendo con i distributori e i librai egli sosteneva di poter spingere le vendite di un libro al massimo fino a trentamila copie oltre era impossibile perch da l in poi contava solo il passaparola dei lettori che evidentemente sempre imprevedibile ergo allora come oggi sempre il pubblico che fa il bestseller nel bene e nel male
3684797 vi chiedete perch dunque mi lagni adesso dinanzi a una nuova possibilit di camuffarmi alloccasione doro che mi si offre di rannicchiarmi inosservato dietro le impenetrabili sembianze di un animaletto che ispira terenerezza be ecco il perch la differenza tra assumere una maschera che sempre unoccasione di libert e averla imposta la stessa che intercorre tra un rifugio e una prigione
3684798 penso sempre che ogni cosa durer in eterno ma non mai cos in realt niente esiste per pi di un istante tranne ci che custodiamo nella memoria cerco sempre di conservare dentro di me ogni momento preferirei morire piuttosto che dimenticare cos la vita non c modo di capirne il senso

3684813 il tentativo tassiano cerca di attuarsi sullo sfondo delle due istituzioni del suo tempo nelle quali il poeta credette fino a illudersi sul loro effettivo valore la corte e laccademia
3684814 il tentativo del tasso si infranse nellurto contro una societ spoglia di dignit e grandezza e fu per lui una sconfitta sul piano poetico la conquistata e su quello umano
3684815 abusare di minuziosit di giuochi di parole di concettini di contrasti artificiosi di lungaggini
3684816 a lonesta baldanza a limproviso folgorar di bellezze altere e sante quasi confuso il re quasi conquiso fren lo sdegno e plac il fer sembiante segli era dalma o se costei di viso severa manco ei diveniane amante ma ritrosa belt ritroso core non prende e sono i vezzi esca damore
3684817 in italia non ci fu lotta fra protestanti e cattolici ndr perche non ci fu coscienza voglio dire convinzioni e passioni religiose morali e politiche le altre nazioni aveva citato francia e spagna ndr entravano pure allora in via essa litalia ndr giungeva al termine del suo cammino stanca e scettica rimase papale con una coltura tutta pagana ed antipapale il suo romanismo non fu effetto di rinnovamento religioso negli spiriti come tento di fare frate savonarola fu inerzia e passivita mancava la forza e di combatterlo e di accettarlo piacque quella maggior castigatezza e correzione nelle forme stucchi della licenza ne dispiaceva quel nuovo splendore del papato e non avendo patria si fabbricavano volentieri una patria universale o cattolica col suo centro a roma
3684818 guardate in viso il petrarca e il tasso tutti e due hanno la faccia assorta e distratta gli occhi gittati nello spazio e senza sguardo perche mirano al di dentro ma il petrarca ha la faccia idillica e riposata di un uomo che ha gia pensato ed e soddisfatto del suo pensiero il tasso ha la faccia elegiaca e torbida di un uomo che cerca e che non trova e nelluno e nellaltro non vedi i lineamenti accentuati ed energici della faccia dantesca manca al tasso come al petrarca la forza con la sua calma olimpica e con la sua risoluta volonta e un carattere lirico non e un carattere eroico e come il petrarca e natura subbiettiva che crea di se stesso il suo universo
3684819 quellantico tronco dalbero che si vede ancor oggi sul gianicolo a roma secco morto corroso e ormai quasi informe tenuto su da un muricciolo dentro il quale e stato murato acciocche non cada o non possa farsene legna da ardere si chiama la quercia del tasso perche avverte una lapide torquato tasso andava a sedervisi sotto quandessa era frondosa
3684820 voglio provarci comunque ad individuare gli eredi semantici moderni di torquato tasso
3684821 quello che mi viene da chiedere se possiamo cogliere nella
3684822 a che cosa servita la liberazione di una gerusalemme se non ad appagare la sua fame dellessere umano ndr di potere e conquista un fatto che ancor oggi si ripete e non vedo un barlume di speranza che un giorno sar diversamente se non quando una catastrofe incombente e superiore ad ogni rimedio umano ci costringer ad aprire gli occhi e la mente e a riconoscere la nostra ignoranza e cupidigia mi sembra che i passi dellevoluzione abbiano sempre avuto il loro spunto da una tragedia contro la quale non esisteva alcun rimedio se non nellazione comune ed unitaria
3684823 tasso e una delle mie letture preferite consiglio a tutti anche le
3684824 ce la stessa ricerca di intellettualistica arguzia del madrigale precedente
3684825 vengo signor gli disse e intanto lira prego sospenda e il tuo popolo affrene vengo a scoprirti e vengo a darti preso quel reo che cerchi onde sei tanto offeso
3684826 sono convinta che questa la vera epica non il testo della new italian epic pur cos tanto scaricato dei wu ming perch nellopera di tasso c il riferimento ad una vera trascendenza e a valori forti e imperituri realt che al giono doggi si sono perse o quanto meno annacquate
3684827 le convenzioni storiche letterarie politiche e sociali dellintero mondo creato indicano nellitalia un paese fatto in larga maggioranza dalletnia italiana che usa la lingua italiana ed ha costumanze e tradizioni appunto italiane e con delle minoranze linguistiche autoctone che tutti sappiamo francesi tedeschi sloveni ecc
3684828 etnia s f aggruppamento umano basato sulla presenza di caratteri somatici culturali linguistici comuni dal gr ethnos popolo
3684829 non credo che la gerusalemme liberata sia opera ancora attuale non la consiglierei a mio figlio almeno che ha 11 anni e sta legendo con passione trilussa lui s attuale
3684830 gli ideali elevati e seri non esistono per il momento non sono di moda nel mondo occidentale evoluto materialmente lo spirito impoverito dai riflessi luccicanti del benessere tace non ha possibilit di reclamare ed aspetta il momento del ritorno della carenza alla quale non esiste nessun rimedio se non rifacendo la rivoluzione o pregare di nuovo il dio della salvezza e della sopportazione il benessere materiale ci rende razionali ci eleva al divino da non aver bisogno di un dio mentre la spiritualit idealista essendo il frutto della disperazione che si crea uno sfogo nella fede in un dio della salvezza
3684831 lopera di torquato tasso assume cos per me unesortazione a liberarsi degli incombenti assunti con la nascita o acquisiti per volont propria o di altri nel disporre di noi come infine di quelli esterni a tutto ci elencato e che ci accompagnano durante tutta la nostra vita tanto da renderla a volte avventurosa caotica leggera pesante irrisolvibile fino a distruttiva
3684832 lisolamento del vero credente in senso religioso dalla realt circostante

3684853 passive solar is the most efficient way to heat and cool using the suns energy because it requires no conversion of energy youre using the suns heat energy directly and designing in proper insulation to keep it from being wasted

3685252 die netto einnahmen aus der maut m ssen in voller h he der verkehrsinfrastrukturfinanzierungsgesellschaft vifg zugewiesen werden nur so kann die substanz durch eine verstetigte finanzierung erhalten werden es ist zeit zum handeln denn der schlechte zustand vieler autobahnen und bundesstra en ist f r die verkehrsteilnehmer nicht l nger hinnehmbar
3685253 diese grunds tzliche weichenstellung muss zuerst vorgenommen werden und hessen lehnt die vom bundesverkehrsminister beabsichtigte mauterh hung ab

3685271 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent

3685295 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3685296 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3685298 i do think they could have waited a bit if they want a worldwide hit i have them all up here pointing to her beehive

3685300 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3685301 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3685302 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3685303 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3685318 may mga bugbog at galos and ibat ibang parte ng katawan ng kapatid ko may saksak pa ng kutsilyo sa may tagiliran
3685319 how can this be suicide the wounds and marks indicate that she had been severely maltreated why didnt dfa officials investigate at all
3685320 this is again another case where the dfa and embassy officials have not only proven themselves to be callous and useless in protecting filipino citizens they have also shown how blatantly they can become so servile to a foreign government turning a blind eye and a deaf ear to the truth so willing to sacrifice yet another victim in return for the chance to export cheap labor and profit from our remittances
3685321 how dare president arroyo say she cares for ofws in no less than her sona statement when we have so many other eugenia baja whose deaths cry for justice
3685322 blatant toleration of human rights violations against ofws and is tantamount to being accomplice to the crime the dfa must investigate this at once

3685444 if the answer is no can i change your mind
3685445 we believe that this is related to a domestic matter and officers made two arrests early this morning

3685461 equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury such as organ failure impairment of bodily function or even death
3685462 when push comes to shove and the only worldly alternative is to use violence properly justified by the evidence of course jesus does indeed die by the sword but not because he picks one up even when faced with a painful humiliating death like a lamb he emphatically refuses to pick up that sword
3685463 the things that make for peace is practicing a radical form of hospitality
3685464 like jesus we should be greatly disturbed in spirit that so many are needlessly dying while war profiteers make millions on the weapons that do the killing
3685465 all dedicated to non violence at some point people like me have to say to people who believe in war that they are wrong and i do not believe that any view point that includes taking arms against someone is a valid view point
3685466 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
3685467 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
3685468 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
3685469 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation

3685474 he bought her a shot and drink and they were shooting the blues for about an hour or an hour and a half
3685475 he gave her four cans and she wanted the other two he said he turned around and she was coming at him with a knife
3685476 then she came at him again and he said he stabbed her again
3685477 he said he left her there and wandered around for a bit
3685478 johns been sick for awhile hes tried to kill himself a couple of times nikki and i were friends he was friends with nikki hed never want to hurt her

3685480 someone obviously broke the womans window out but that could have been anybody
3685481 when they closed the door he went to the window and was still yelling
3685482 one of the brothers picked up a small coffee table and threw it at the window in attempt to scare him off
3685483 they tried to explain to the guy they didnt bust his window out
3685484 theyd seen two kids do it i feel like it was stupid what the guy did and i hope justice takes its course

3685486 i fully appreciate that the stance is within a world heritage site and as such a presumption against trading exists but this is an area of public entertainment that already includes bars indian restaurants pizza restaurants and various businesses what it does not have is a pavement option offering fast reasonably priced food
3685487 the main drive of my business is daily residents and tourists not night time drinkers alcohol fuels antisocial behaviour not quality food
3685488 the facility will encourage loitering of persons whom have consumed alcohol within the area and will also encourage antisocial behaviour

3685490 we are able to provide a range of catering including coffees and teas cold drinks panini sandwiches and confectionery to both staff and students at much more attractive prices than perhaps charged by high street operators
3685491 it is in part a service to our students who are finding their levels of disposable income being stretched further year on year the other benefit is that the public will be able to purchase items which are attractively priced

3685496 your discretionary release at this time would thus not be compatible with the welfare of society at large
3685497 i think its important perhaps today that we need to move from the public relations aspect to reality
3685498 we are no longer talking about a theater we are talking about the death of this entire renaissance square project
3685499 the first is the availability enthusiasts want to have the update in their hands and microsoft have decided to focus this update on oems
3685500 the reason microsoft have done this in my opinion is that fiji is a significant change to the core of windows media center and due to the massive variety of hardware out in the wild ms thought this was too big of a risk
3685501 the other reason why enthusiasts will be disappointed is the feature set is not what a lot hoped for in the us consumers wanted directv support and for uk users while the update enables dvb s it does not have h 264 so bbc hd will not work
3685502 media center used to get yearly updates but since vista there have been no new features and fiji almost got mythical status in the enthusiasts community which this update only has a small set of the hoped for features
3685503 so in short if your an mce 2005 user whos been sitting on the fence waiting for vista to become stable and to become the hd media center this news can be taken as wait for windows 7 as vista isnt as hd ready as it was implied

3685572 that is simply not the way in which international relations can be run in the 21st century
3685573 weve got to make sure that the russians realise that they do have rights in the international system but they must be allied with responsibilities
3685574 and when responsibilities are not upheld there are political consequences for russia
3685575 its unprecedented since the g8 became the g8 in the 1990s for seven countries to come together without an eighth country but that has happened over the last few days and i think that makes very clear to russia that there are political consequences
3685576 there is merit in looking at how we make sure there is a proper international presence there

3685590 ik ben geschokt over het aantal ongelukken met autos op de weg zeker bij jongere mannen
3685591 vooral door een slecht inzicht en de sociale druk waardoor jongeren vaak te laat op de avond nog al dan niet dronken achter het stuur kruipen wij leggen er de nadruk op dat met de auto rijden inderdaad leuk kan zijn maar vooral veilig
3685592 ik ben er tamelijk zeker van dat we zullen komen tot een internationale oplossing waarin ook europa betrokken is
3685593 ik ben zo blij dat ik op mijn 25ste als actrice kan werken en dat mensen beginnen inzien dat ik ook hersenen heb dat iemand ook maar kon denken dat ik een sekssymbool ben daar kon ik niet bij de mensen die met mij op de middelbare school zaten hadden dat zeker niet zien aankomen
3685594 ik heb er altijd naar verlangd om te acteren ik heb een passie voor het vak toen ik dertien was ging ik bij de lokale toneelgroep en daarna begon ik reclamefilmpjes te doen mijn ouders zorgden ervoor dat ik een liefde voor het theater ontwikkelde en daar ben ik hen dankbaar voor
3685595 de mannetjes kunnen soms erg agressief zijn als ze willen paren doden ze vaak de jongen om het vrouwtje opnieuw seksueel ontvankelijk te maken dit wijfje had eerst nog een kleintje maar ik heb het al een tijd niet meer gezien dus ze moet het verloren hebben

3685602 great technology and world class customer service are imperative in online advertising and i believe that thanks to its independence and focus on delivering what it does best specific media delivers on both
3685603 it is a company that fully understands the value of anonymous consumer data and how to use that data to the benefit of advertisers publishers and the users themselves there is an established pecking order in the online advertising space and i feel confident that specific media can make significant inroads into that over the coming months
3685604 an industry heavyweight such as colin joining the specific media team in europe is a real feather in our cap
3685605 we only entered the european market through the acquisition of adviva in march 2008 and growing our footprint there is of key strategic importance for the company colin has as impressive and extensive experience in the industry as you could find and we are looking forward to him driving the company forward alongside the rest of our european team

3685616 the initiative deceptively reads like its supporting all alternative fuel vehicles and renewable energy sources
3685617 but a closer read finds a laundry list of cash grabs much of the measures billions could benefit pickens company to the exclusion of almost all other clean vehicle fuels and technology
3685618 even worse private trucking and delivery companies could buy 5 000 natural gas trucks collect california taxpayer funded rebates of 200 million or more and immediately send those fleets out of state
3685619 its like asking california voters to finance a new bridge with taxpayer dollars without mentioning that the bridge could be in ohio
3685620 it is hard to tell if the water scheme is the device being used to seize the land or if the wind turbine scheme is the means by which he will fund the water scheme
3685621 no matter what the case may be nancy pelosi will personally profit from whatever pickens does as an investor
3685622 while the stock was initially offered at 14 and is now valued below that amount the low of 10 in early july of this year is bouncing back
3685623 especially in light of ads by pickens and growing consensus that the pickens plan will gain support especially if pelosi is firmly behind it

3685627 we are committed to providing increased integration with other high value web application services so that our users can get the most from their data
3685628 we believe storage to be a commodity and that the true value of working data is what you can do with it how you can access it and how it integrates with others
3685629 we already provide our users the ability to use a rich web client igoogle the iphone or a light mobile client to access their data
3685630 our storage service is built on top of amazon s3 and we will make an exciting announcement about new ways to access our service quite soon we will also be announcing some exciting new collaboration integration to enable our users to do even more with their data

3685695 post ume screening is unnecessary dissipation of energy and wastage of resources
3685696 it is unacceptable for any institution to ignore the ume scores completely let me say that jamb does not have any problem
3685697 whatever post ume they want to do let them do it however they must do it right what we noticed is that some of them are not doing it right
3685698 for example all the universities are supposed to be at this meeting today but some are just conducting their post ume today and tomorrow and they are expecting jamb to be there it is not possible
3685699 for the post ume the regulation is that jamb must be present there is a law guiding this thing you must abide by it
3685700 when i say that post ume is not necessary i assume that we have all seen that jamb is on track things have changed for the better and i have seen universities who came to me to say that post ume is the same as the universities matriculation examinations ume so why should they do it again
3685701 some states have written us that there should be no post ume at all because they believe in what jamb is doing some universities have even written to say that they are not going to do post ume at all because they believe in what jamb is doing
3685702 all of them are involved in the conduct of the ume examinations and they saw it that it was good therefore why should they worry about post ume
3685703 so all they need to do is to screen the candidates in terms of certificates to see whether they are the really qualified to enter the university
3685704 we were of the believe that the inec based on the electoral law and because of the changes in the demographic and the increasing number of the people moving here if we can have more wards or delimitation delineation of boundaries but actually increase at the legislative level
3685705 right now we have only two members in the house of representatives right now the territory has grown from 300 000 to almost three million residents we definitely believe we deserve two additional members in the house of representatives making four because we are by and large as more than some states of the federation
3685706 it is very clear that fct is witnessing speedy population growth but what may not be clear to many is the pattern of population distribution besides not a few are aware of the direct impact of the rising number of people in the territory at present political constituencies electoral wards and polling units in the nations capital requires an urgent increase because the effects of population in abuja is at alarming stage thus the earlier district constituencies electoral wards and polling units carved out can no longer grapple with the teeming population of active voters
3685707 we have just come to listen to the people we have made some proposals and those proposals will be given to the people so that we can agree together on what to do
3685708 so that is one f the challenges we have and we will like to know from the master plan where precisely people should be settled as close as possible to the master plan and when we put polling boots it should be permanent so we dont have to be moving it all over the place
3685709 the crisis and confusion that has rocked the boat for the electoral fortunes of pdp in anambra state emanated from the leaders that is why the party requires someone with grassroots experience in mobilization and party administration to pilot its affairs

3685785 this is a really disturbing set of data that will not go down at all well at the
3685786 the sharp spike in inflation in july increases the risk that the bank will raise interest rates despite the fact that the economy seems more likely than not to contract over the second half of the year
3685787 these figures show that things are only getting tighter for families across the uk it is vital that pay rises keep pace with inflation to ensure that our standard of living is not slashed over coming months better pay would also improve consumer confidence
3685788 this current battle with inflation is particularly worrying for consumers as it is being driven by higher prices for essential things
3685789 although the oil price has been falling back over the last few weeks and we could see petrol price inflation begin to ease over the next couple of months we expect little respite from high food and utility prices

3685804 it is likely to go to the board in september and it is quite possible that at that time this issue of an ad hoc consultation could arise
3685805 the purpose of this is to persuade members to adjust their policies in their own interest and in the interest of the international system
3685806 ultimately this is not about pinning labels on countries its about trying to ensure that policies are adjusted so that we can get a smoother development of the international economy and more crisis free adjustment process

3685851 this kind of exhibition does not happen anywhere else in the country we are doing it for the first time we have made the seven wonders of the world and by the means of seeing you can know the magnitude of the size of the cake what we have made
3685852 now the children can know about the seven wonders of the world before this we all knew about them in the post history but they have shown the seven wonders in different way
3685853 allow me to make a little history in the second congressional district tonight and introduce my partner marlon reis
3685854 growing up i always worried that that would get in the way
3685855 im proud to say that many of those barriers while some still exist have fallen tonight
3685856 its about changing the culture of washington and its about new ideas
3685857 we werent sure how voters would feel about that kind of self financing but it seems like enough of them dont mind

3685860 we have overwhelmingly introduced the recommendations that have been made in the past and the government makes very clear today to railcorp the board and management that the recommendations that will be forthcoming before the end of the year will be fully implemented
3685861 there have been more than two icac reports over the past 13 years
3685862 there have been repeated recommendations made in the same area that if implemented years ago could have avoided this latest scandal
3685863 thats what frustrates taxpayers it frustrates commuters and it angers commuters given the safety implications
3685864 its a basket of instruments that we use to assess the overall cost of funding and so to rely on one particular benchmark doesnt give the total picture so certainly it has an impact and certainly as i said we will be doing our best to provide the best possible rate that we can
3685865 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3685866 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3685867 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3685868 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3685869 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3685870 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3685871 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3685872 we are not yet recommending the return of the civilians because of possible mines what we are doing is procedural thats why were calling them conditionally cleared
3685873 well make sure that qantas responds appropriately that all the maintenance documentation relating to these aircraft has been checked and double checked
3685874 this is why we can put our head up and say that our safety standards are second to none

3685876 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time
3685877 the sea ice causes problems for us in terms of observing the ocean in that it makes ship observation very expensive and slow
3685878 satellites cant see the ocean through the ice and the profiling floats we are using throughout the worlds oceans now are also unable to surface through the ice and transmit their data by satellite
3685879 the sea ice is important for climate because it is bright and reflects the suns energy back into space so if we have less sea ice the earth tends to absorb more energy and so warm up
3685880 weve never been able to measure how much sea ice is actually forming before and the seal data is allowing us to do that for the first time
3685881 we will be instrumenting a total of about 160 seals both in the arctic and antarctic using several different species of seal because different seals go to different places to feed so we can get information from different parts of the ocean
3685882 i think this really is a pretty clear indication rather than it being climate change causing the rapid extinction of the tasmanian mega fauna which was the current orthodoxy
3685883 there are no russian peacekeeping units or forces supporting them
3685884 we do not yet have a peace deal we have a provisional cessation of hostilities but this is significant progress
3685885 the idea of having monitors what you call peacekeeping troops i wouldnt call them like that but european controllers monitors facilitators yes yes and yes that is how europe should be on the ground
3685886 we have a tradition that in times of crisis the opposition stands united behind the president and does not attack him but georgia should not have advanced into tskhinvali south ossetias capital in so unprepared a way that was a grave error
3685887 the difference between lunatics and other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them
3685888 we will be forced to take other measures to prevent any repetition of the situation that emerged because of the outrageous georgian aggression
3685889 plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of russia
3685890 they shot their brother russian peacekeepers then they finished them off with bayonets so we are not going to see them there any more
3685891 there are a few things that need to be discussed to get a full ceasefire
3685892 the russians are saying that they will never again accept georgians in any form in south ossetia they see them as a trojan horse that started the attacks last week
3685893 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3685894 abkhazia and ossetia if i mention territorial integrity are to the best of my knowledge part of georgia
3685895 nato is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict
3685896 require the signing of a legally binding treaty on the non use of force
3685897 why are people waving flags its not as if we won
3685898 i wonder why he did it he has only 10 000 soldiers and he takes on russia
3685899 i didnt spend much energy on the way out and just used all my energy on the second lap and it went pretty well
3685900 im happy to make the final for the fourth time in a row
3685901 but it gives me confidence i can swim my own race under pressure
3685902 we meet again tomorrow what counts then is the title and not the record
3685903 only three of us have won the 100m freestyle ever in the olympic games and i would love to see another one
3685904 i think the 100m is still regarded as the blue riband event i will be there jumping up and down
3685905 it is one of my fastest times in the past couple of years so i take a lot of confidence going into the final
3685906 why should the motorists of australia not have access to the same price information that the good motorists of western australia have had for many years
3685907 it is the liberals who decide what happens in the senate theyve decided that they will back big oil companies rather than give information to consumers like motorists have had in this state for many years
3685908 if senator xenophon or any other senator has suggestions that they can make to make the legislation more acceptable to them which dont undermine the governments fundamental policy objectives to give consumers and motorists a better go then wed be happy to consider it
3685909 were just told that if you dont sign the documents were going to do it anyway and if you dont agree to it and fight on with it then well were told under the legislation there is a 60 000 fine and or one year in jail
3685910 i want to get this straight if the horse is positive of a virus that people can contact and get ill and die from it then were in agreeance with them
3685911 but we are told the horse is free of the virus and has only got the antibodies in his system
3685912 we had a lot of work to do obviously to get in a position where apple and at amp t would feel good about best buy mobile carrying it and thats what weve done in the last 18 months
3685913 the first call the cfo makes is to the marketing department
3685914 she had them contained before a little bit of luck fell their way in the fifth innings
3685915 i thought we went ok and can take plenty out of that game the us certainly didnt dominate us
3685916 our goal this tournament is not to focus on the opposition but our own performance
3685917 you need to keep in mind weve played the top two teams in the world in our opening games and we only have to finish in the top four
3685918 i think a bit of pressure will come off now and we can get into a groove
3685919 australians dont have much respect for the music press it runs counter to their culture
3685920 the idea of anyone actually daring to criticise musicians for the sound they make is almost heresy
3685921 everyone is treated equally which means no knocking anyone back however great the temptation
3685922 if he wants to blame anyone he can blame his compatriots they are incredibly vocal over there
3685923 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3685924 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3685925 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3685926 its an exciting time for our newly named club as we embark on new paths and forge ahead with new initiatives and player development
3685927 the new name is falling in line with the modernization taking place within north america fc reflective of the worlds game
3685928 this is a really exciting part of the relationship between the two clubs
3685929 were delighted to not only consolidate but expand on the affiliation we already have with sheffield wednesday we are the only academy in western canada to enjoy such a relationship with a uk club and that is something we are very proud of
3685930 we will continue to bring players into sheffield wednesday to give them the opportunity of making the standard required in england
3685931 in addition the players and coaches of sheffield wednesday will come to canada to help elevate the standard in our game which has really taken off over the past couple of years
3685932 we always say we want the best players and the more options we have the better
3685933 as well as bringing players into our academy we will also have the chance to develop our own players over there well be taking teams across to canada to experience a different part of the world but who share the same philosophies as us and that can only be good news for all parties concerned
3685934 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3685935 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3685936 invest in water for farming or the world will go hungry
3685937 its some sort of bug or virus inside his body that has been accentuated by the heat stress he suffered on the first day it appears to be just a one in a million chance
3685938 even yesterday when i was talking to doctors they thought it was incomprehensible that he could deteriorate as quickly as perhaps he was going to and did last night its come as a major shock to everyone we are gravely concerned for him
3685939 he was as good as gold during the day and he was quite happy with the way that everything had gone
3685940 he started complaining of a migraine on saturday night and we thought it was just dehydration
3685941 there are thousands of us here and none of us have fallen ill we are told by health officials that its non communicable
3685942 this regulator has been of interest to researchers and clinicians for many years now because its controller or receptor found on the surface of blood cells is critical in regulating their many functions
3685943 because our discovery shows precisely what the receptor looks like and also how it works we can now begin to design new drugs to rein in the deadly abnormal blood cells
3685944 abnormal gm csf signalling is pivotal to a variety of serious and difficult to treat diseases
3685945 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3685946 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3685947 michael phelps has become the greatest gold medal winner in the olympics history
3685948 i was actually thinking about it on the medal ceremony
3685949 i was trying to get ready for the relay keep my mood focused i kept fighting myself every time i started thinking about the gold medal record tearing up a little bit
3685950 the people who came before us and competed in the olympic games are some of the greatest athletes who ever lived and to win the most gold medals its unbelievable i just have no idea what to say
3685951 it might be once a century you see something like this
3685952 the greatest challenge we face is to try and reduce the dependence on the import of grains whether by increasing local production or whether by making more efficient use of raw materials in feeding livestock
3685953 this must be done despite all limitations mainly the lack of water
3685954 if the desalination and recycling projects are implemented a lack of water is not expected in 2013
3685955 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3685956 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3685959 the balance of these opposing forces favours continued modest economic growth with credit growth not too far below the average of the past decade
3685960 i thought the result was pretty good especially in the context of a very difficult general operating environment with credit markets essentially malfunctioning for the better part of the reporting period

3685971 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
3685972 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
3685973 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
3685974 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
3685975 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
3685976 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
3685977 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
3685978 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
3685979 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
3685980 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
3685981 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
3685982 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
3685983 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
3685984 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

3685995 thats what the chairman has said to me so i trust him
3685996 it was a superb hat trick the first one was opportunist the second one a trademark jermaine beckford finish but the chip for the third goal was exquisite
3685997 he has a lot of technique a lot of ability but also a lot of bravery because you can make yourself look pretty foolish if it doesnt come off
3685998 we do still have to remind ourselves that hes a guy that was only playing non league football three years ago so hes come a long way very quickly
3685999 his attitude throughout was superb the thing were trying to get across to him is that quality players and goalscorers top ones that is repeat and repeat and repeat theyre not just one season wonders

3686002 we are expecting a response from dot prior to the scheduled public hearing
3686003 our concern is that this is in strong contrast to what was recommended to us
3686004 its important that responsible development be applied you can get the golden egg and kill the goose that laid it in the process we want to make sure that beautiful northwest guilford county is preserved
3686005 traffic is already a big issue on 68 edgefield and pleasant ridge roads plus were worried about northwest schools already being overcrowded and clear cutting of trees to build
3686006 our hope is to have the area treated like oak ridge rather than treated like high point
3686007 why do they need to develop more in our area when there is already plenty of space available elsewhere all within minutes of the airport
3686008 what we felt were compromise conditions they really didnt meet any of them except what they would have had to meet anyway we are extremely disappointed with their lack of earnest compromise
3686009 what happens here will set the bar on what happens in this area in the next few years
3686010 although i am very pleased to hear him listening to those around him i saw several quotes from school board members and parents who praised him for saying i dont know and not having a ready made plan
3686011 personally im all for a ready made plan that includes giving back more power to teachers and principals incorporating the community in the schools finding ulterior means for educating students more interested in disrupting schools than planning for their future preventing and not merely handling violence in schools and bringing back skill classes like shop keyboarding and home ec for students not on a traditional college track
3686012 while it was nice to hear that mr green didnt think he had all the answers i would have been more confident if he had a firm vision of direction for guilford county schools
3686013 hopefully this will come after his 100 days of listening mr green will have to stand up and be a leader and hold people accountable
3686014 i think his lack of specifics and plans may be his greatest strength
3686015 mr greens biggest challenge will be to overcome the morale and intimidation issues and the lack of trust that the grier years have heaped upon our teachers

3686032 the only thing i am missing is some trophies and hopefully that will come in the next year ive never had any intentions of leaving this club
3686033 sometimes things are said in the press but the boss said to me that that is not relevant and he wants me here with liverpool

3686036 we put them in a school which we felt was the right fit
3686037 i went in one day and found out that there was one teacher who scolded or you could say threatened the students
3686038 children that age are learning through exploring within certain boundaries let them do what they want if an elephant is purple its purple if its out of the line it doesnt mean it should go in the dustbin
3686039 then i said to myself what the heck i can do this
3686040 it involves a different mindset as to what learning is all about its not sitting at the desk reading for three hours its about life experiences
3686041 if you put them in regular school thats controlled and managed the question is whos managing it
3686042 we will teach them day to day communication how to fill up forms write a simple letter and so on it will not be exam oriented
3686043 she was bullied because she was doing badly and i feared for her physical safety the teachers didnt seem too concerned
3686044 i had never thought about it because she learned to read quite early on
3686045 i think shes beginning to see the importance of some sort of education and she realises that shes doing this for herself and not for me
3686046 oh definitely she misses the day to day contact but she was bullied so badly at school this way shes been able to bloom

3686128 if russia had a different option of reacting to georgias aggression against south ossetia we would have used it
3686129 but we didnt have this option when several thousand civilians are killed the state must act accordingly

3686136 the insidious impact of section 377 also permeates different social settings like workplaces families hospitals and the popular press and ultimately creates a popular understanding of homosexuality as perverse dirty and illegal this in turn legitimises violence against lgbti persons section 377 provides the fig leaf of legitimacy to the harassment of lgbti persons by families the medical establishment and other official institutions

3686141 no doubt some people will claim that these proposals are unworkable unreasonable and perhaps plain barmy
3686142 but the issue is clear current regeneration policies are failing the very people they are supposed to be helping and there is no evidence that the trend will be reversed without radical changes

3686145 and he said unto them go into the world and preach the good news to everyone every where
3686146 god overlooked peoples ignorance about these things in earlier times but now he commands everyone everywhere to repent of their sins and turn to him 31 for he has set a day for judging the world with justice by the man he has appointed and he proved to everyone who this is by raising him from the dead
3686147 therefore i urge you brothers in view of gods mercy to offer your bodies as living sacrifices holy and pleasing to god this is your spiritual act of worship do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind then you will be able to test and approve what gods will is his good pleasing and perfect will
3686148 and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a good conscience toward god it saves you by the resurrection of jes us christ
3686149 we believe that this solution for high inflation has already been taken too far without other solutions further interest rate hikes will only be detrimental to the economy and could lead to a situation of stagflation
3686150 stagflation usually follows in instances where a certain crisis such as the power crisis in south africa leads to increased prices which could give rise to less profitable production levels
3686151 it is vested in the idea that inflation is increased by an increased amount of money in circulation which influences the ability of the economy to make sufficient provision in the past two years the money supply increased by approximately 23 year on year which led to larger spending
3686152 higher interest rates meant that people had less money to spend but very little was done to solve problems on the production side
3686153 the consumer is footing the bill production is also decreased while the producers because of the higher sales prices of items make sufficient profit even if fewer items are produced
3686154 it is a cause for concern that many retail companies still attain increased profits in difficult economic conditions just because they are riding the wave of inflation by increasing their prices by more than inflation this trend will in future have to be prevented by better competition
3686155 although the sarb has tried to curb inflation by means of interest rate hikes the same approach can no longer be followed
3686156 tito mboweni uses interest rates as the only weapon against rising inflation
3686157 if supply surpasses demand prices will decrease south africa should now focus on expanding infrastructure and assist its people to be more productive
3686158 for this reason the government should now focus on the production side of the economy and increasing skills rather than simply placing money in the form of social grants in peoples hands when increased production is attained prices will be constrained which will eventually also curb inflation

3686165 it may still just be summer but there is a feeling of chill in the economic air the british economy is going through a difficult and painful adjustment due to higher energy and commodity prices and in banking credit and housing markets this adjustment to our economy cannot be avoided and as a result inflation is rising and growth is slowing
3686166 the adjustment of the uk economy to higher commodity prices and a more realistic pricing of credit will be painful the next year will be a difficult one
3686167 the current period of above target inflation although very marked will be temporary and inflation will return to the 2pc target
3686168 inflation is likely to rise further this year and to peak at around 5pc in the coming months
3686169 both consumer spending and house prices are likely to weaken together in addition the continued adjustment of banks balance sheets has resulted in a monetary squeeze and tighter credit conditions as shown by the sharp contraction of underlying money and credit growth
3686170 the impact of this is very clear in residential and commercial property markets where activity has slowed as prices have fallen surveys have suggested that housing price indicators point to a substantial slowdown
3686171 we are in a period where prices are adjusting to new levels both buyers and seller are struggling to find out what that new level is the market will determine it not us or the government once we have reached that level then prices should normalise but that does not mean back to levels seen early last year that was clearly excessive
3686172 one of the factors we have to take into account is that import prices this year will be 10pc higher than they were last year we have seen nothing like that nothing on that scale at all since the early 1990s that is bound to contribute in some sense to this what we hope will be a temporary rise in inflation
3686173 attention is now turning away from liquidity and more towards questions of funding and viability of an institutions business plan
3686174 for some institutions that means they are over the worst and for other perhaps not but i think we have certainly moved some long way down the road
3686175 what we havent seen of course in the uk is that we havent yet gone through the period of the sharpest slowdown and that will have some clearly some impact on the losses which the banking system will see and the banks have a cushion of capital to absorb losses when there are as inevitably there are slowdowns in the economy in some periods
3686176 and the question will be whether the combination of the losses made on financial instruments in the past year combined with the capital raising efforts they have made to offset that will still leave them with a sufficient capital cushion to absorb losses from the slowdown in the economy and that we havent seen play out yet so we have to go through that process
3686177 what we have seen in the past year or so is the culmination of a very large rise in energy and commodity prices such that oil prices are at the highest level in real terms at any point in the post war period apart from the late 1970s and also weve seen the biggest financial dislocation since the second world war
3686178 what is unique about the present circumstances is that both shocks have occurred at the same time the combination of those two shocks which have originated primarily in the rest of the world economy have meant that life is extremely difficult and will be for the uk economy over the next year it doesnt mean to say that it will go on for ever it wont we say here well see slow growth broadly flat output for around a year and then growth will resume
3686179 libor rates will probably stay relatively high relative to the policy rate for some time financial markets are expecting them to edge down over the next year or so this is precisely the backdrop to the adjustment we are seeing in bank balance sheets

3686196 both consumer spending and house prices are likely to weaken together in addition the continued adjustment of banks balance sheets has resulted in a monetary squeeze and tighter credit conditions as shown by the sharp contraction of underlying money and credit growth
3686197 it seems inevitable that extended very weak economic activity and deteriorating business confidence will exact an increasing toll on the labour market over the coming months
3686198 mean that the eventual next move in interest rates will be down
3686199 unfortunately this is one necessary mechanism of bringing about a lasting slowdown in inflation
3686200 the good news is that reports such as this limit the risk of an interest rate hike and brings forward the likely timing of the first interest rate cut

3686242 nikunjo rati keli siddhyai or intimate associates of the gopis as alleged by tamal krishna goswami and others since 1978 seven of these eleven have fallen down into illicit sex with women men and children the rest having from the beginning supported these seven and being part of the same group themselves are considered also fallen from a philosophical view and subtle behaviour
3686243 the argument that after the departure of the spiritual master anyone of his disciples can give initiation cannot be applied in the case of srila prabhupada who specifically named 11 persons only at first to fulfil this function
3686244 was dictated to him by srila prabhupada as he was serving him as his secretary and now he srila prabhupada had tamal krishna write a letter to all the gbcs
3686245 srila prabhupada also signed as approved on the july 9th letter
3686246 tamala krishna goswami the leader of a large number of sannyasa and brahmacari preachers insisted that he was now their via media in relating to prabhupada and expected that his godbrothers follow him absolutely
3686247 i do not think that there is any problem in accepting the spiritual masters who srila prabhupada appointed
3686248 6 months before his own demise prabhupada had announced that he would appoint some of his disciples to perform all of the functions of initiating new disciples as he had become too ill to do so those so initiated would still be prabhupadas disciple while those who would be initiated after his demise would become his grand disciples shortly thereafter prabhupada selected eleven disciples to begin assisting him and asked his secretary to communicate their names to the rest of iskcon following srila prabhupadas death and the fateful meeting with prabhupadas godbrother sridhara maharaja the eleven gurus named by prabhupada assumed the extra ordinary position above all others
3686249 from time to time the security service finds a small group here and small group here lets say thats something we will live with for years will not stop today
3686250 no there is no violence in libya itself you know

3686252 we think that this mix of terrorism illegal migration trafficking in persons trafficking in drugs its becoming real dangerous

3686254 the much vaunted process of moroccan reform has taken a step back
3686255 we could mention the casablanca riots in 1965 or in 1981 or the events in fes in 1990 in our collective consciousness there are many bad memories of demonstrations and general strikes

3686327 were seeing an increase in consumer awareness of a variety of mobile advertising campaigns from text message to interactive games to mobile internet banner advertisements
3686328 with mobile phone usage growing its logical for more companies to seek mobile marketing as a way to reach their segmented targets in this direct and highly interactive medium
3686329 these findings indicate the degree to which the mobile phone is used as a marketing channel with enhanced handsets and flat rate data tariffs increasingly common it is only a matter of time before mobile internet advertising starts to rival the penetration of sms or text message marketing

3686445 now im starting to kind of wonder what kind of person i was
3686446 but its not really relevant because i dont know that person
3686447 if i was a computer it would be like my hard drive was erased
3686448 every single person i met said you need to write a book about this
3686449 i thought what the heck what do i have to lose
3686450 i just freak out and start gagging when i see them
3686451 ive been this way for as long as i can remember
3686452 just seeing a chain connected to an anchor in the water causes hyperventilation cold sweats and the shakes
3686453 there has to be something associated with it because nobody is going to develop a fear of cotton balls just all of a sudden
3686454 anybody that has a fear of something that is unthreatening is experiencing a conditioned response

3686471 i have had the phone for a couple of weeks and i havent had any dropped calls until a couple of days ago now at least 50 per cent of my calls get dropped or i get a call failed message when trying to make a call even though i have a strong signal on 3g
3686472 the phone will also bounce from 3g to edge to no service and then back to 3g the phone works fine if i turn off 3g but that defeats the purpose of having a 3g iphone
3686473 how a device performs in individual situations depends on circumstances like where you are in the 3g coverage how close you are to a cell site things like terrain and buildings all come into play
3686474 im not denying that people are having a less than satisfactory experience but overall the phone is doing great
3686475 the dupebox is simply an evolution of our existing product range we have always strived to offer our customers the perfect balance between professional quality products and a best possible price with the new dupebox i consider we are really managing to achieve what other manufacturers might consider impossible
3686476 stordigital duplicators are designed and engineered by the best team in the business we are always looking at the potential of new products and markets and theres always going to be something round the corner that will set the market alight
3686477 the fact that each unit has its own internal hard drive for storing and reading the master source there is less likelihood that the duplication job will fail or suffer from buffer under run due to restrictions in the data flow
3686478 the reality is there is some difference but most people look at it and say i am not going to pay extra for that
3686479 the introduction of our lightscribe duplicators really does represent a turning point in the way people approach disc publishing
3686480 we don t consider that the lightscribe system is perfect for everybody it won t replace our automated inkjet printers but having a tower duplicator that can also label your discs is a strong selling point

3686489 and when she said that it was just this awful feeling and my heart just sunk and was just like she did it

3686521 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3686522 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3686523 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3686524 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3686525 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3686526 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3686527 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3686528 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3686529 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3686530 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3686531 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3686532 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3686533 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3686534 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3686539 the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feeling and expression
3686540 i was moved every time we did a rehearsal on this from the bottom of my heart
3686541 please save the last bit of trueness in our children
3686542 they think yang peiyis smile is not cute enough what we need is truth not some fake loveliness i hope the kids will not be hurt this is not their fault
3686543 after the recording we thought that lin miaokes voice was not very suitable
3686544 finally we made the decision that the voice we would use was yang peiyis
3686545 this is in the national interest it is the image of our national music national culture especially during the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important extremely serious matter
3686546 i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3686547 my voice was used in the performance i think thats enough
3686548 the music director announced just now that it was not your voice when you were singing at the opening ceremony the song was actually performed by you two girls
3686549 doesnt care who sang the song as long as she performed
3686550 i dont care about this either the only thing i care about is that my daughter will not get hurt by this shell understand when she grows up
3686551 we had been through several inspections they were all very strict when we rehearsed at the spot there were spectators from various divisions especially a leader from the politburo who gave us his opinion it must change
3686552 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in the aspect of voice yang peiyi is flawless in each member of our teams view
3686553 i am satisfied that my voice appeared in the opening ceremony

3686570 when the hiqa report was published on 2nd april 2008 many people told me that the report would lie on a shelf and the recommendations would be quietly and quickly forgotten
3686571 i refused to accept that cynical but understandable response and i have remained determined to see the 15 highly important recommendations implemented in full yesterdays highly visible publication of the implementation plan by the hse is evidence that essential changes are beginning to occur and that patients will eventually benefit from safer care and treatment in respect of symptomatic breast disease
3686572 greater openness transparency and above all an acceptance of accountability for patient safety
3686573 i hope this kind of publication will become a regular feature in future communications by the hse i will be following closely the progress made by the hse towards the full implementation of the recommendations and i await with interest the publication of their next update

3686580 i didnt have to say anything to them even though they are very young they have a lot of experience as well and they have their own ways to learn from their own experiences and they used those ways
3686581 we are human when it comes down to it we make mistakes and it came down to china had a better day today give us another day we could probably come out on top

3686586 its quite clear that maori feel disenfranchised to some degree in terms of disengaging from the process because for so long there was scant regard for maori aspirations in terms of what the parliament was up to but thats changing and i think the more people get involved the better it will be all round
3686587 they seem to have been done by one carver which we are still looking to find a bit more about who obviously had training in whakairo but also possibly other european styles of carver as well so theyre an interesting mix of different carving tradition

3686638 the russians are looting everything in sight the whole city is full of marauders
3686639 it is the russian cossacks and the ossetians that are causing mayhem the local population is actually relieved to see regular russian troops in gori hoping that the soldiers will protect them from the marauders
3686640 the eu has as yet quite a weak foreign policy and the eu as a union hasnt been very much in evidence
3686641 the europeans are taken less seriously by the russians but on the other hand they are better placed for any kind of intermediary role because the americans are obviously on the side of the georgians
3686642 a lot of the european member states are seen as less biased against russia
3686643 and thats why you see those countries that have good links and have been less critical of russia are very much in action
3686644 the european union wants to mediate between russia and georgia but its influence is marginal it is a conflict between the u s and russia about regional hegemony
3686645 the old members of the european union have more moderate positions while the new ones which have had to deal with russia in the past have firmer ones
3686646 that move would frighten a lot of people particularly some nato members because it would for the first time open the possibility of nato peacekeepers coming up against russian forces
3686647 makes the valid point that russia cannot be seen any longer as an independent neutral peacekeeper what do you put in its place the eu doesnt have any guts and nato is the only body left that has peacekeepers who are prepared to go into situations like that

3686679 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3686680 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3686681 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about

3686688 tapi dalam mengeluarkan surat keputusannya selalu menggunakan kop surat alamat pkb di jl kalibata dan keputusan yang selalu dikeluarka tanpa membubuhi tandatangan dewan syuro hanya menyebut ketua umum dan sekjen saya juga tanda dewan tanfidz

3686702 to encompass all interactive techniques the touch the speech the vision
3686703 because theyre fairly developed in the labs i can say that in 10 years will be widespread

3686705 cash and i have been glued to the olympics how amazing was the opening ceremony i still dont know how they coordinated 2008 people to move in perfect sync
3686706 trust was unable to produce monthly waiting time data between july 2007 and january 2008
3686707 the production of the waiting time data in february revealed a significant number of waiting time breaches which had occurred there were 63 inpatient breaches

3686709 you cannot have operations cancelled at the last minute in these kinds of numbers

3686713 hes almost identical to me he reminds me of myself
3686714 the criminal offence route should not be the only sanction as it may be a cumbersome remedy to enforce transgression of the financial reporting standards
3686715 we are of the view that administrative action and administrative sanctions should be the primary methods of enforcing the financial reporting standards
3686716 the enforcement of the financial reporting standards will only be adequately addressed if it is done in a timely manner before markets have made economic decisions based on financial results
3686717 retail sales came in a bit better than expected but one thing to remember is that the data has been declining for a while for four months in a row so to get the bigger picture we must consider that

3686727 people are fleeing there is a mood of absolute panic the idea there is a ceasefire is ridiculous
3686728 they asked villagers to hang white flags or handkerchiefs outside their houses if they did not want to be shot they say
3686729 behind them say eyewitnesses is a whole column of irregulars who locals say are chechens cassacks and ossetians
3686730 eyewitnesses say they are looting killing and burning these irregulars have killed three people and set fire to villages they have been taking away young boys and girls
3686731 we do not yet have a peace deal we have a provisional cessation of hostilities but this is significant progress
3686732 the idea of having monitors what you call peacekeeping troops i wouldnt call them like that but european controllers monitors facilitators yes yes and yes that is how europe should be on the ground
3686733 we have a tradition that in times of crisis the opposition stands united behind the president and does not attack him but georgia should not have advanced into tskhinvali south ossetias capital in so unprepared a way that was a grave error
3686734 the difference between lunatics and other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them
3686735 we will be forced to take other measures to prevent any repetition of the situation that emerged because of the outrageous georgian aggression
3686736 plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of russia
3686737 they shot their brother russian peacekeepers then they finished them off with bayonets so we are not going to see them there any more
3686738 there are a few things that need to be discussed to get a full ceasefire
3686739 the russians are saying that they will never again accept georgians in any form in south ossetia they see them as a trojan horse that started the attacks last week
3686740 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3686741 abkhazia and ossetia if i mention territorial integrity are to the best of my knowledge part of georgia
3686742 nato is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict
3686743 require the signing of a legally binding treaty on the non use of force
3686744 why are people waving flags its not as if we won
3686745 i wonder why he did it he has only 10 000 soldiers and he takes on russia
3686746 dit kan een effect hebben op de prestaties van onze atleten
3686747 we zijn bezorgd we vinden de vele controles bij ons team ongewoon
3686748 er wordt veel bloed getrokken bij de controles dit is geen protest maar we vinden het toch wat abnormaal
3686749 de eerste ronde was redelijk goed maar de tweede was er te veel aan
3686750 het ging niet beter en een tijdrit liegt niet je kan maar zo snel rijden als je kan een frisse monfort moet hier echter tussen de 10e en 15e plaats kunnen eindigen hij kwam gemotiveerd aan de start en de afgelopen dagen had hij er nog alles aan gedaan om goed te zijn hij heeft goed gerust en was gerecupereerd maar het vat is na een slopende tour de france gewoon af bij maxime hij is dringend aan rust toe
3686751 ik ben er tamelijk zeker van dat we zullen komen tot een internationale oplossing waarin ook europa betrokken is
3686752 its would also consider the memorandum of understanding between the sadc secretariat development bank of south africa and deed of trust and the records of the july 2008 trade and finance ministerial meeting held in lusaka zambia
3686753 we do believe that out of this summit and under our chairpersonship we must ensure that we are able to take the processes of integration to a much higher level staring with the free trade area and then moving much faster integrating our economies
3686754 it is clear that a successful sadc regional economic bloc will make a major impact on other regional economies in africa
3686755 i never imagined before that what im gonna say will all make sense now but here goes john mayer you rock

3686762 the other countries out there were very very fast and we gave them a good fight
3686763 it wasnt the result we were looking for but we have just got to keep our heads up and keep our eyes on the target
3686764 little prospect of offering their residents the standard of living to which they aspire
3686765 realistic about the ability of cities such as manchester leeds and newcastle to regenerate struggling nearby towns such as liverpool bradford and sunderland
3686766 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position regeneration in the sense of convergence will not happen because it is not possible
3686767 it is very disappointing i feel like i am fit but the ankle is unable to handle running quite yet

3686771 i came here with the intention of producing an olympic performance i am doing that now and i will produce a big one on finals day
3686772 the nice thing about seeing fred bat at six is that it gives us balance and lets us put out the attack we put out in the last test
3686773 watching the bowling attack with the four seamers it gave us lots of options to maintain pressure for longer and thats really promising
3686774 when were looking at the side for india which may have two spinners we need to get the balance right between getting runs and taking wickets
3686775 simply not the way that international relations can be run in the 21st century
3686776 that is a reversion to not just cold war politics it is nineteenth century way of doing politics
3686777 i think it is very very important at a european level but also at the un that we assert that that is simply not the way in which international relations can be run in the 21st century
3686778 well hes got that in his armoury for sure hes a terrific little footballer

3686790 nach unseren angaben k mpfen von 2500 bis 3000 s ldner auf georgischer seite gegen russische friedenssoldaten
3686791 ich denke die russen w rden einer entsendung europ ischer beobachter und berater zustimmen
3686792 ich bin davon berzeugt dass solche l nder wie die ukraine ihre friedenskorps im rahmen des internationalen mandats zur verf gung stellen k nnten um zu garantieren dass die verpflichtungen die in der n chsten zeit bernommen werden k nnen erf llt werden
3686793 die klage enth lt unterlagen die von ethnischen s uberungen zeugen die russland von 1993 bis 2008 auf russischem territorium vorgenommen hat

3686799 according to our investigations more than one person committed the crime they were all thought to be males who used guns and were armed at the time of the crime according to eyewitnesses a knife was also possibly used
3686800 there are fewer uncertainties you ride your own race and somehow its less aggressive you cant affect anyone elses race and they cant affect yours you go into a time trial and you wish the other riders well and you just concentrate on doing the best you can
3686801 you dont get many professional cyclists whore studying for phds
3686802 shes one of the nicest girls and shes also one of the most intelligent and shes put that to good use in beijing
3686803 the climbs arent consistent the gradient changes all the time so you cant get into one steady rhythm
3686804 i spoke to the tutors on her phd course and managed to get some time off to really concentrate on her cycling and her talents really shone through since shes done that shes one of the worlds best climbers and she used that to great effect if you map out her performances theyve got closer and closer to world class level and now shes one of the best riders in the world both on the road and in the time trials

3686816 while the limping economy has hurt most retailers wal mart continues to be a big beneficiary
3686817 there is scarcely anything in the world that some man cannot make a little worse and sell a little more cheaply the person who buys on price alone is this mans lawful prey
3686818 workers across the country are outraged that wal mart is trying to squelch the employee free choice act by encouraging its managers and supervisors to vote against democratic candidates this fall because the democrats would make it easier to form unions in stores like wal mart
3686819 three women and an afghan man have been killed they were coming from
3686820 three foreign nationals and a man have been killed by unknown gunmen in an area just outside pul i alam
3686821 aid organisations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups

3686834 many of the organisations receiving funding this year cater for the elderly ranging from informal community networking groups for senior citizens to professional organisations that offer a range of services
3686835 their needs and the importance of meeting them are a clear priority
3686836 i am pleased that additional funding has also made it possible to support a number of heritage and cultural projects which are vital to the development of community networks and which help to foster community spirit
3686837 tara ed angelina sono amiche e si tengono in contatto via e mail
3686838 non ho mai avuto un periodo della mia vita come quello di serena dove facevo uso di droghe ed andavo a letto con il ragazzo della mia migliore amica non ho mai attraversato momenti cos pazzi nella mia vita ho baciato solo tre persone oltre a quelle sui vari set di cinema e tv lo so sono strana spero ha scherzato blake che brad pitt non senta quello che dico non vorr mai sposarmi
3686839 ero rappresentante di classe facevo parte della squadra delle cheerleaders stavo nel coro ed ero iscritta a ben sei club differenti non ho mai bevuto non mi drogo ma dormo tantissimo
3686840 sar molto pi urban scrivo ogni giorno qui nel salone seduta al pianoforte e il lavoro migliore che abbia mai fatto
3686841 preferirei di no ma se dovessero desiderare una cosa del genere non vorrei condizionarli
3686842 wed like to get the route back but we said that last year and it was very disappointing to lose it
3686843 heathrow was a very valuable route for us aer lingus carried nearly 330 000 passengers on that route alone
3686844 we dont know what yields theyre getting out of belfast
3686845 were hoping that city jet can come in on a london city shannon route but we cannot say when thats going to happen
3686846 ryanair have also taken up some of the slack into london running flights into stansted gatwick and luton
3686847 we did research last year and the main concern for people in the mid west and business people in particular was long haul connectivity and the need to fly into the city of london
3686848 were talking to people in shannon airport london city airport air france and business people in the mid west about opening a possible route
3686849 only last month we had to cope with the death of a really nice guy and the town is just numb now
3686850 we heard about rory pretty quickly on saturday night and we couldnt believe it
3686851 the town went very quiet people just went home when they heard
3686852 he was a take life as it comes type of fella
3686853 he wouldnt get too stressed about things and he wouldve been very well known in maynooth
3686854 we arrived about four minutes after being contacted by the coastguard
3686855 the wind was blowing strong from the south west and the waves on the shoreline were between one and oneanda half metres high it was not suitable swimming conditions
3686856 we sent a crewman into the water and when we recovered him we immediately offered oxygen
3686857 we can confirm that we are providing consular assistance to the family
3686858 its about creating a society in which everyone is valued for the unique contribution that they can make
3686859 our campaign champions face equality and encourages people to stand out and show their support
3686860 face equality is about being treated fairly and equally irrespective of facial appearance
3686861 many of these attitudes are unintentional and unwitting but still result in prejudice and discrimination against people with disfigurements in the way that they are treated at work and at school how they are portrayed in the media and how people react to them when they are out in public
3686862 i want people to look in our eyes and see us as people
3686863 and i was honoured when they asked me im delighted that my face will stand out and stand up for people with disfigurements
3686864 my face will be put up as an image for social justice
3686865 they changing faces sent a letter to my home in longford asking for people to join their young peoples council
3686866 i asked if it would be possible for an irish person to join and they said yes
3686867 then last march then they asked me would i front their ad campaign
3686868 already we had launched a face equality at work campaign and barclays bank were the first to sign up
3686869 they said theyd support the campaign and put it into practice which is great and now were looking for as many businesses as we can get
3686870 i was playing in the family care outside my home when i was twoyearsold
3686871 it was september 1990 and i managed to lock myself into the car
3686872 then somehow i pushed the cigarette lighter in the car and dropped it onto one of the seats
3686873 i was rushed to the intensive care unit of our ladys childrens hospital in dublin
3686874 i was unconscious for a month and was being fed through a drip i spent five months there in total
3686875 i was burned nearly 18years ago and ive adjusted and am a very confident person
3686876 now i ignore it if people stare or look because i know its not me its society
3686877 if i go into a caf with my friends i shouldnt be looked at as the centre of attention
3686878 its not me who has the problem its other people and i suppose the campaign is about educating people and making them more comfortable with the whole thing
3686879 i mean there are no newsreaders no famous actresses or movie stars with facial disfigurements
3686880 were trying to target the areas of health education policy making employment and the media
3686881 these areas need to improve so that everyone has equal rights
3686882 ninety per cent of people will just do stuff unconsciously like if someone goes for an interview there is that moment when the interviewer is shocked
3686883 the general public shouldnt discriminate against people for the way they look im a survivor but i dont want pity from anybody either
3686884 well im finished my second year in social studies in the dublin business school and am living up in dublin with three other students and loving student life
3686885 i dont know whats going to happen in the future with technology and stuff but you cant be going into hospital all the time either
3686886 in the future i feel like i want to get into social work
3686887 this is a very exciting time for me it feels great to go out there and start getting clients although i was a little daunted at first to leave my full time job to start going it alone
3686888 i was terrified at the thought of it but i thought thats why i had to do it
3686889 lots of people didnt want to know but by the end of the road i had my first client
3686890 i now plan on doing it again maybe along the kings road
3686891 life on the island was a different world to any where i have lived since
3686892 i had a little trouble with the traffic lights in co cork when i first visited as we only have two roads back home with no crossings and i was allowed to drive since i was 13
3686893 but i always felt i would make something of myself and set out on my own and the experience i have achieved so far has been invaluable
3686894 not everyone back home on the island always understands that
3686895 bei diesem wettbewerb zeigt der mittelstand der it branche dass er einen gro en teil der hightech innovationen in deutschland leistet
3686896 die vielen bewerbungen zeigen welche bedeutung gute internet strategien f r den unternehmenserfolg haben
3686897 montevisto hat uns eine kluge vertriebs strategie konzeptioniert die uns und vor allem unseren kunden mehr vertriebs und vermarktungsm glichkeiten in die hand gibt
3686898 die rtv hat ein sehr gro es potenzial dieses potenzial werden wir gemeinsam weiterentwickeln und in vertriebserfolg umwandeln die strategie steht nun konzentrieren wir uns auf die umsetzung mehr wird nicht verraten
3686899 mit unseren erfolgreichen akquisitionen haben wir das portfolio der bdi vom anlagenbauer f r die biodiesel branche hin zum komplettanbieter von industriellen l sungen erweitert
3686900 damit werden wir neue gesch ftsfelder entwickeln und uns langfristig von unternehmen der biodiesel branche differenzieren k nnen
3686901 es lohnt sich mit invoiceeasy das komplette produktsortiment und den eigenen kundenstamm einzupflegen und zu verwalten
3686902 the fyrom premiers letter surpasses the limits of diplomacy and borders on nationalistic hysteria which is bad for his people
3686903 macedonia was is always will be greece macedonia means greece
3686904 it is astonishing that the government has apparently sub contracted the study of this vital subject to the very industry which has most to gain from allaying those concerns
3686905 these facts if true bring to light a disturbing conflict of interest in the preparation and presentation of critical research into the health effects of noise from aerodynamic modulation in the ever larger and more sophisticated machines for which planning permission is being sought in the south west and around the country
3686906 is it conceivable that a study of the possible health effects of smoking would be chaired by someone on secondment from the tobacco industry
3686907 this site is unsuitable for many reasons and councillors clearly supported our view when they overwhelmingly voted to turn down the original application
3686908 we expect that the developers will follow with a full application for an industrial wind turbine development within months
3686909 we suspect that the developers have already made their minds up to push forward with the plan and we do not think that figures recorded by the monitoring mast will be significant in this decision
3686910 but the fight is far from over and we are preparing for the next phase
3686911 i should like to hear their proposals first hand but i will be making it clear that i am in total support of my constituents who have concerns
3686912 some stakeholders wanted the hearings held in the new year
3686913 and the city of lethbridges concerns about visual impacts could be significantly mitigated and possibly completely eliminated if this portion of the transmission line was constructed underground
3686914 the commission understands that an underground line will be more costly and will bring its own unique environmental impacts
3686915 nevertheless the commission directs altalink to submit evidence with respect to costs and environmental effects of building the lines underground
3686916 as well it says the hearing will consider such issues as human health and the social effects of the line including such health issues as electromagnetic field exposure
3686917 we think logan county is perfect for a wind farm
3686918 its a flat area in central illinois with available farmland and it offers a great deal of advantages
3686919 were going to take our time and make sure we have everything in order
3686920 education and communication are very important in this process and we need to make sure that the landowners and their neighbors are fully informed about our objectives
3686921 for the farming community we think its a great way to bring additional income to their farms
3686922 im not a crazy green person but i like to do what makes sense
3686923 its a financial burden for something that is the height of a silo
3686924 with all of the restrictions put in place i dont see how anyone could put a turbine in
3686925 if you owned a piece of property and there were neighbors you would need about 90 acres to locate a turbine to maintain that 1 000 from your neighbor
3686926 most people looking to put up a small turbine are usually on a residential lot of 2 to 5 acres
3686927 includes landowners from both sides of the issue not just those involved in the industry
3686928 turbine heights that approach the height of a cell tower should not be considered small turbines
3686929 this allowance requires that communication occurs and protects the interests of all parties including those looking to construct a wind turbine as well as current adjacent homeowners
3686930 also landowners that plan on building a home on vacant land in the future should be taken into consideration
3686931 without knowing youre going to get an approval for such a thing
3686932 i would hope the county would come up with wind turbine regulations that would be user friendly and not as restrictive for something that an average person could do
3686933 no problem submit a site plan and we will give you a permit
3686934 i figured that if he could put it close enough to his house and not worry about ice throw i dont think that i had to worry about it
3686935 damming every river and putting wind turbines of every ridge line
3686936 obviously the effects of damming a river are far greater than erecting wind turbines large dams usually mean major permanent changes to water courses with significant impacts on wildlife and ecosystems
3686937 i am concerned about the shadows because this is prime farmland
3686938 other than that this really is the way of the future
3686939 in my view based on all the negative publicity that this program has gotten rate payers deserve a full refund of any money they contributed to this plan
3686940 efficiently and expeditiously we are also complying with the pscs request for additional information regarding how the programs funds were spent
3686941 fpl is committed to promoting renewable energy in florida sunshine energy was a successful part of that strategy it fulfilled every promise made to program participants and led to the creation of the states largest solar array to date at rothenbach park in sarasota county
3686942 we do not believe this individual has any legitimate interest
3686943 what are we going to do for all these weeks its going to be horrible theres no television no cell phones no video games no malls
3686944 theres nothing to do here but watch television play video games and go to the mall

3686954 were planning on moving forward just as soon as we can
3686955 were looking at all alternatives certainly firstly to new brunswick and we see opportunity to move into the northeast united states
3686956 the fundamental question is who is going to buy that power and where do they want to sell that power
3686957 when you talk about wind energy there are limitations in terms of the amount of electricity generated from the wind that you can integrate into your jurisdiction
3686958 from a resource perspective theres no doubt its possible and much more is possible its matter of whether they can get a contract
3686959 the local and wider impacts were not sufficiently made clear turbines of that size 74 metres standing on the 120 and 110 metre contours will loom over a huge area of south pembrokeshire and be visible from most high ground within the area
3686960 because of the nature of the landscape the turbines will be visible from high ground from beyond llanteg from red roses to the ridgeway between lamphey and tenby and from the north of narberth
3686961 the confidence of residents in the honesty and integrity of the planning process in pembrokeshire is under threat from this consent
3686962 the councils planning and rights of way committee resolved to grant conditional approval to the proposal at the meeting held on july 31
3686963 all representations including those made by cprw were taken into consideration by the committee prior to the decision being made
3686964 the council is aware that the assembly government has received a request to call in the application
3686965 the proposed development will be an important driver of local economic development for years to come
3686966 i had occasion to fly over the 60 turbine wind energy farm off the dutch coast on may 11 and counted 14 not working
3686967 recently a colleague mentioned he had just flown over the large kentish flats turbine field and at least a third were not working
3686968 given the uk government has realised its eu driven policy for refineries to use a designated proportion of biomass in their overall production is flawed surely it is time to wake up to the errors in policy concerning wind turbines as well
3686969 ofgem noted in 2006 they were less than 26 efficient overall a further 2006 study of january wind observations over a 12 year period for the renewable energy foundation concluded that average minimum output from wind farms across the uk was 3 7 with typically 70 power swings in a 30 hour period wind is certainly not sensitive to peak demands and the electricity turbines generate cannot be stored
3686970 a study of met office wind data proves that claims that wind is always blowing somewhere in britain are false weather systems can be far larger than these isles especially in very cold periods when there is no wind at all yet huge demand for power
3686971 nuclear power plants cannot easily vary output on demand thus can only provide the steady base load
3686972 the complex system of renewable energy certificates rocs allows the power companies to boost their charges by up to 60 70 nothing short of another disguised tax on the consumers net earnings typically the developer can recoup his capital in four years and the rest is profit
3686973 a citi investments report in january this year said the value of rocs which in 2006 cost the taxpayer 600 million by 2020 would be costing 36 billion wind might be free but extracting energy from it certainly is not
3686974 tidal power is totally predictable for many years ahead and is naturally synchronised around the uk coast for smoothing out power generation
3686975 there are countless reports and studies on wind turbine sites that provide sensible and sophisticated analysis and express grave reservations about wind power they cite denmark as leader in the field for some 30 years having long since responded to the publics health concerns and stopped developing onshore wind farms
3686976 gordon browns knee jerk reaction resulting from the governments inaction following kyoto and current pressure from the eu to conform to renewable energy targets by paying out billions to mostly overseas companies for old technology when he should be choosing to leapfrog ahead with new better technologies is a national disgrace
3686977 the installation of two wind turbines represents a substantial capital outlay but the club has applied for various grants which hopefully will assist towards the costs
3686978 these turbines are an intrusion into the countryside and one of them is proposed to be very close to the motorway so will be a distraction to drivers
3686979 ive already had residents phoning me up even though their property overlooks the sports field they havent been notified about the plan
3686980 i do find it regrettable that the sports and social club didnt discuss this with the parish council
3686981 they havent provided a rationale its going to kill wind energy
3686982 im not in any way against a dental clinic but youre talking about a pretty good chunk of taxpayers money i just think we should have a contract
3686983 as a developer its harder to find sites because when you find a good location somebody else already has a meteorology tower collecting wind data
3686984 weve got plenty of sun but theres not the wind
3686985 why not just give up when we see the mess the world is in sometimes we just want to throw our hands in the air and call it quits dont we
3686986 they look at the mess the world is in and they just throw their hands in the air and call it quits
3686987 our customers must be able to focus on their business objectives and keeping end user satisfaction high
3686988 working with toucan global demonstrates how realtunnel through its support for ice stun turn and https tunneling is a key contributor to optimizing end users voip experiences
3686989 with paradial toucan global can increase the availability and usefulness of the snap communicator
3686990 the pope has a cat he loves a lot so why doesnt he use it for one of his capes
3686991 for instance weve learned that when someone has a haploid insufficiency and is missing one copy of the tgf gene he or she is more vulnerable to environmental insults that can cause cleft palate such as drugs smoking and alcohol
3686992 we found that if we blocked tgf or the receptors a cleft palate develops
3686993 but when smad4 was blocked normal palate epithelium still covered the palatal shelf
3686994 this information is useful not just for palate and teeth but also for cancer and cell biology in general
3686995 ultimately we have to be translational in order to make ourselves useful to patients
3686996 our study was also able to demonstrate that for patients at an average risk for gi bleeding starting ppi cotherapy at a younger age was marginally cost effective while starting ppi cotherapy at an older age was highly cost effective
3686997 ultimately physicians should discuss the gastrointestinal risks of low dose aspirin with their patients and consider ppi cotherapy
3686998 the stomach normally has a protective coating to prevent acid related injury but aspirin and other non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs or nsaids impair the stomachs ability to form this barrier coating potentially leading to ulcer formation
3686999 furthermore these drugs may themselves cause injury directly to stomach cells and can impair the ability of platelets to form a plug in the event of bleeding
3687000 many americans are currently taking low dose aspirin for coronary heart disease and we know that ppis are effective in reducing ulcer bleeding in patients on aspirin
3687001 what we didnt know however was whether it is worth paying for these drugs for patients on low dose aspirin who had no other risk factors
3687002 some of these same gene regulatory networks are re activated in the adult to direct the growth of new blood vessels
3687003 this can be beneficial as in the case of a heart attack
3687004 finding that a single factor regulates a large part of the angiogenic process creates a significant target for therapeutic development for any disease involving the vascular system
3687005 the next step is to find ways to modify this microrna in the setting of disease and test its ability to alter the disease process
3687006 we already know that ptks are associated with several types of aggressive cancers including colon breast and lung cancers
3687007 what we have discovered is that ptks have an important role to play as cancer cells grow and mutate to become potentially more aggressive tumours
3687008 the more we can learn about how tumours develop the more we are able to prevent their growth in the future there are already drugs that inhibit particular ptks in the late stages of treatment our discovery could change the timing of when and how those or similar drugs are administered
3687009 our studies have shown that ptk pathways are intimately associated with the regulation of checkpoint responses during dna replication
3687010 we have identified one mechanism by which ptks may remain activated and allow cancer cells to bypass the molecular warden of dna replication they may lack a key enzyme called tcptp
3687011 but the big question remains what happens in the real world of human cancers
3687012 is that the founders of these disciplines envisioned the same thing that you have this broad dispersal of all of the organisms that each happened to be studying and that they would colonize the surface of the earth depending on whether the environment was suitable for them
3687013 before now all biologists could do was look at the biodiversity of microbes that could be cultured in a petri dish we now know that the vast majority of microbial life cannot be kept in captivity now we have the ability to grab dna from the environment and try to characterize different species or taxonomic groups using genetic material allowing our field to blast off
3687014 we are just beginning to scratch the surface of what these patterns look like
3687015 was that the diversity gradient more correlated with temperature than primary productivity
3687016 sackler colloquium in the light of evolution biodiversity and extinction
3687017 from our study we saw that environmental selection seemed to play a larger role and was more important for microbes than the plants
3687018 you have to be careful about the conclusions that you make
3687019 so on a 2 000 meter elevation gradient for example the spatial scale relative to the body size of a plant is much much larger when you consider what the universe looks like to a microbe
3687020 diversity patterns on mountainsides have been studied mostly on plants and animals for hundreds of years
3687021 yet microbes are the most diverse set of organisms on earth and they are really important for how ecosystems work our study establishes the first elevation gradient pattern for microbes we found that yes microbes do have a diversity pattern that is similar to what has been studied for plants and animals but the pattern is different than what you see for plants in the rockies and there is much to be done to understand why microbes might have a different biodiversity pattern
3687022 i dont think that microbes are fundamentally different from a biological standpoint from plants and animals i think that we havent figured out how to study them in an analogous way
3687023 what we have done is take two very different approaches to the challenge of creating bulk metamaterials that can exhibit negative refraction in optical frequencies
3687024 both bring us a major step closer to the development of practical applications for metamaterials
3687025 natural materials do not respond to the magnetic field of light but the metamaterial we created here does
3687026 it is the first bulk material that can be described as having optical magnetism so both the electrical and magnetic fields in a light wave move backward in the material
3687027 the geometry of the vertical nanowires which were equidistant and parallel to each other were designed to only respond to the electrical field in light waves
3687028 the magnetic field which oscillates at a perpendicular angle to the electrical field in a light wave is essentially blind to the upright nanowires a feature which significantly reduces energy loss
3687029 what makes both these materials stand out is that they are able to function in a broad spectrum of optical wavelengths with lower energy loss
3687030 weve also opened up a new approach to developing metamaterials by moving away from previous designs that were based upon the physics of resonance previous metamaterials in the optical range would need to vibrate at certain frequencies to achieve negative refraction leading to strong energy absorption resonance is not a factor in both the nanowire and fishnet metamaterials
3687031 our results show that almost half of people questioned felt they had bought their endowment policy on a false promise this is not just a case of a small purchase this is thousands of pounds for a house that we are talking about
3687032 there are several reasons that somebody may have been mis sold an endowment policy including a lack of adequate explanation an endowment policy is not a short term commitment and this should have been made clear when the policy was bought as should the fees and risks involved
3687033 without this information people were unable to make an informed decision and should be able to claim some compensation depending on the circumstances
3687034 the few that had the risks associated with an endowment explained at the time of purchase will be unable to claim compensation

3687092 this is an avenue we need to further the peace negotiations but we need to do it right with all transparency and with the inclusion of all stakeholders yun yung hinihingi naming
3687093 if indeed the sc declares the moa as unconstitutional we will still again persist in trying to find another agreement to forge another agreement that will hopefully encompass everyones sentiments
3687094 there has been no roof collapse only a part of the railing of a staircase on the first floor collapsed students only received minor injuries

3687162 if not the party could be headed for a real tragedy
3687163 more likely uncompromising clinton supporters will experience those emotions not when clinton is given her due but when obama officially clinches the nomination the party can only hope that that catharsis will purge the clinton holdouts of their refusal to recognize reality if not the party could be headed for a real tragedy
3687164 there is now evidence indicating that his actual valid birth certificate on file in hawaii says barry soetoro that was the indonesian identity that obama acquired when lolo soetoro adopted him it seems that obama put a fake birth certificate on his official campaign website because he wanted to hide his indonesian identity from us including his muslim background and that pesky constitutional dual citizenship matter our researchers have been unable to locate the public record showing that barry soetoro legally changed his name back to barack obama

3687168 why would bill clinton make the strange comment last week
3687169 obama ran a brilliant campaign avoiding all of the drama that plagued the clinton campaign and showed that he understood message discipline while successfully navigating minefields like the reverend wright debacle which could have sunk other campaigns
3687170 is one of four prime time headline speakers we will have a separate keynote speaker
3687171 for those who have not followed this story soetoro is the name on obamas birth certificate bc because a new bc was issued when he was adopted by lolo soetoro his step father his original bc which we assume was issued for barack hussein obama at birth would have been sealed at that time we assert that barry soetoro acquired indonesian citizenship in approximately 1965 1966 and may still hold it the birth certificate published by obama on his campaign website and distributed to the media was forged because the real bc on file is in the name soetoro an identity he apparently wanted to hide from the american people

3687199 the whole strategy was to come out and basically scam this guy

3687208 you could say manu ginobili or tim duncan to me and id get the dry heaves right now
3687209 so i think every coach has always been through a team that does something that you try different things and thought you had it covered and it just didnt work that day
3687210 it happens it just happens if you play things like that are going to happen
3687211 some days youre going to be that way some days the other teams going to be that way and thats why theyre emphasizing defense because a lot of those teams shoot the ball well
3687212 villanova shot the ball extremely well against a very good defensive team that may have been my best defensive team so its hard to say theres nothing you can do but try to make adjustments try to put in wrinkles and try to see what you can do
3687213 any time you beat a team such as the u s who was favored youve got to make plays youve got to have things like that happen and they did
3687214 its no different than trying to beat the boston celtics for the championship for us youre not going to beat them unless you make plays and then some things have got to go your way and they made plays
3687215 when you run it to perfection its not easy to stop it and thats what they did
3687216 when you have a steve nash or somebody its tough to guard
3687217 its funny when they say we dont have an answer to that well weve run it for four years now and they havent had an answer for steve nash yet and youve got some of the best minds in the country trying to figure out how to stop it
3687218 sometimes your offense can save you when your defense wasnt playing well

3687254 current drugs given to people with lewy body and parkinsons disease simply treat the symptoms
3687255 this model is the first platform to understand how the brain cell deterioration takes place we will use this model to identify targets for new drugs to slow or prevent the disease
3687256 further research using these models will enable us to find new drug targets people with lewy body disease suffer memory loss visual hallucinations and movement difficulties
3687257 unfortunately research is severely underfunded and much more is needed if we are to defeat this devastating disease

3687291 we have had to produce different tyre compounds to adapt to the new surface which appears less grippy than before
3687292 in the past the track has been quite abrasive but the new surface is very smooth and slippery and it was difficult to find grip from the surface the times were still quite good because the act of resurfacing the track has reduced the bumpiness
3687293 we had to adjust the compound of our tyres for this new surface which we hope will allow all our teams and riders to get off to a good start when practice starts on friday morning
3687294 the surface has got quite old in the last couple of years not really bump but just so abrasive and cracked
3687295 i think the brand new surface is going to be awesome i heard they didnt just put something on top they did it the right way and started over
3687296 we tried out the surface and those tests told us the track is really aggressive on the front tyre but not so aggressive on the rear which means the tarmac isnt particularly aggressive but that the combination of the layout and the new surface does work the front very hard
3687297 we will bring some new compounds to brno but we will have to see what our motogp riders make of it

3687309 ive said his before i dont care who we play i think we have a decent team here and we have just shown that we are more than capable of beating a top championship team the bottom line is though they are in the next round not us
3687310 thats the way it is they took the chances they had and we havent
3687311 we have the players to score the goals we have got chances in the team but tonight we didnt take them
3687312 their first goal was a great cross a fantastic ball
3687313 there is nothing we can do but draw a line under it now and move on because the next one is the next challenge
3687314 it was a long four days and it doesnt take the hurt away from saturday
3687315 but thats behind us and we have to kick on now in an important and tough game against ipswich
3687316 a clean sheet was very important tonight and brian jensen made a double save big saves at that spell of the game
3687317 ive always said that when you bring good players to a club sometimes you get a tremendous response from those already there and thats whats happened with brian i think diegos arrival has given brian a real kick start and it has given me a real selection dilemma for saturday but thats what i want
3687318 we got a response tonight in what was never going to be an easy game
3687319 bury were buoyed by a terrific result on saturday and the conditions were tricky but i thought we passed the ball well in the first half and had numerous chances we felt it was only a matter of time until we got the goal and i was delighted because it was a real footballing goal
3687320 i am delighted for martin three goals in two games show the reason why we brought him to the football club and he will be a real asset for us
3687321 i think we could have passed it better in the second half and while there was only one goal in it it was always going to be nervy
3687322 nggak ada persaingan di sini kita seneng sama sama masuk nominasi

3687329 its a breakthrough in the sense that were measuring a part of the ocean weve never been able to measure before
3687330 it took a great deal of persuading by the icc before they agreed
3687331 if any company has the credentials to create a credible challenger channel it is virgin given its strength in music retail live events digital downloads and radio its lack of a branded tv offering seems an oversight
3687332 but the audiences are so small and fickle that there is hardly any ad money there unless it sells across channels or media like emap whose channels are manifestations of its magazine and radio brands
3687333 require schools to consult with parents who in turn have to give their agreement for their child to have their fingerprint recorded and used
3687334 we have given parents an opt out the opt out is that you dont have to have anything to do with the system whatsoever and that you then heave the responsibility as a mum dad or carer to provide a very healthy alternative to your child
3687335 hey how did you find a band called big c ck what were you really looking for on the internet
3687336 right from the opening track big cock reintroduces us to the excesses and perfection of 80s hard rock solos hooks rhythm sex fisticuffs
3687337 hes kinda been chopped up over the years you know so now we took all those pieces that have been chopped up from different tours and put em all together and he does this awesome bass solo
3687338 and then we bust into about 10 12 van halen songs for the hardcores that gotta have it were gonna give you the other halfs version which is basically closer to the record than laughs what the last van halen tour was unfortunately
3687339 but the fact of the matter is when we did the tour in 2004 ed didnt want me there because of my
3687340 to sign on to do the tour they made me relinquish any rights and claims i had to the van halen name the logo whatever at this point there is basically nothing going on as far as van halen goes its tough to say that but im not going to sugarcoat anything any more
3687341 i wish alex was my brother and ive said that to him many times
3687342 ed and al are tight as hell and you aint going to get between them when youre with them youre an outsider so mike and i were always buddying up when ed and al would start speaking their native dutch and smoking cigarettes and getting in fistfights laughs
3687343 i dont have a lot of faith in another van halen reunion id be totally willing if everything was cool but ill tell you straight up everythings not cool
3687344 it was the most surreal thing i think thats ever happened to me in my life
3687345 no it doesnt make sense to pay off a loan and have your money tied up in a depreciating asset
3687346 in the back of my mind 3 d was always in a bag of tricks that somehow i wanted to pull out one day
3687347 there are plenty of famous people who are not in there there just wasnt room for everybody
3687348 i fell in love with rock n roll and the beatles and bob dylan and with a good helping of drugs i wanted to live my life that way
3687349 it is one of the few magazines that stayed true to its original mission and audience from the beginning
3687350 wenner was able to maintain the original flavor and keep the passengers on board while bringing in new ones rs is unique there is nothing like it on the same scale
3687351 i dont think its lost its clout culturally if you look around at all the media and think about the most impactful place you can be if youre a musician or a movie star rolling stone still carries more weight and prestige i dare say than time which used to have a lock
3687352 the army and security forces will not yield to attempts to terrorise them with attacks and crimes
3687353 the tanks just rolled past us with their guns at the ready definitely looking like they were ready to engage
3687354 its the same scenes as we were seeing at the beginning of the conflict as far as the people here are concerned the politicians may be talking about peace but theres really no sign of it here
3687355 we will conduct investigations and make sure justice is implemented
3687356 the army and security forces will not yield to attempts to terrorise them with attacks and crimes
3687357 even a mule wont bump his head again in the same place
3687358 by singing in harmony from the same page of the same investing hymnal the diehards drown out market noise
3687359 i was wondering how people on this forum built their net worth
3687360 existem duas formas de conhecimentos a racional e a intuitiva
3687361 porque a palavra da cruz loucura para os que perecem mas para n s que somos salvos o poder de deus
3687362 mas n s pregamos a cristo crucificado que esc ndalo para os judeus e loucura para os gregos
3687363 ora o homem natural n o compreende as coisas do esp rito de deus porque lhe parecem loucura e n o pode entend las porque elas se discernem espiritualmente
3687364 por un lado las acciones deben ser m s sensibles a los valores actuales de los sensores
3687365 no sabe de nada pero trata de realizar movimientos que son naturales para su cuerpo despu s de una hora y media se mueve y salta sin problemas
3687366 i think a lot of fund managers are staying on the sidelines and waiting to see if we revisit these levels
3687367 many could move in then to buy if we do
3687368 one hour and 2 minutes is a really really tough race
3687369 now is the moment to enjoy and to be happy and proud that i won
3687370 im very very happy and very proud of this ride today and to go home with two medals
3687371 in the situation i was in not being able to do the tour de france i was really motivated
3687372 i worked very hard for this and it paid off i pictured myself on the top step but this is brilliant
3687373 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpretated as an affectionate gesture
3687374 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3687375 poor reputation for insensitivity towards racial issues has been further harmed
3687376 the spanish basketball federation and seur declined to comment wednesday
3687377 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
3687378 when youre young all you think about is enjoyment you dont really worry about what the future holds being a youth
3687379 but after a while being on the circuit and seeing what can be done this is what i do for a living so i gotta really focus on what i want im focused now i know what i want
3687380 after the world juniors people were saying youre fast kid i was 15 then and they said you can be one of the greatest
3687381 that did not mean a lot to me then but now i know what theyre talking about
3687382 a lot of people my parents my coach my agent everybody trying to say you have a bright future in track and field and explain what you can get out of it and so on
3687383 i started with coach mills in 2005 and from that moment on ive been going up
3687384 i started slow but now im there and im just trying to stay on top now
3687385 i hadnt had much chance to run the 100 metres my coach has been forcing me to run the 400
3687386 i guess its just instinct im working on im just trying to stay away from the 400 metres
3687387 i guess i just blew peoples minds with the 100
3687388 through decisions about whether or not and how to proceed with the partnership and cooperation agreement

3687390 this last option becomes the first in order not to let the situation go out of hand
3687391 kashmiris will continue to agitate peacefully and we should not give indian oppressors any chance to use brute force
3687392 the central government must give the land to the amarnath shrine board otherwise our protest will continue
3687393 nobody is going to say you are not supposed to appear but i would say i wasnt necessarily encouraged
3687394 it appears to be consistent with the previous indication that proposed witnesses had given us
3687395 this is a serious matter it has to do with interfering with witnesses this is a committee of parliament
3687396 the chair of a standing committee does not have the authority to take any further steps with regard to this matter
3687397 that the party wasnt really thrilled for you to go
3687398 i am telling you very clearly the national party did not tell any of the witnesses to ignore their summons
3687399 i resent profoundly that the conservative advised lowry whether or not he should attend attending a parliamentary committee is not optional and i resent profoundly them offering him talking points trying to guide what he should and should not say
3687400 i still think it is a valid thing to do
3687401 its nothing but racial profiling that led to the death of that young man
3687402 as soon as they see our kids whether theyre black or latino they see criminals the police are hostile to them they arrest them and sometimes they shoot them
3687403 the police see three individuals of non white culture and they automatically get interrogated and questioned
3687404 its not surprising that people at some point might rise up and say they cannot accept it any more
3687405 well hes got that in his armoury for sure hes a terrific little footballer
3687406 he needs to stay fit now and well see what will happen to him if he does stay fit
3687407 from all of them yeah absolutely from all of them its vital thats there
3687408 ive said to them that theyll put their bodies on the line when they play and they do
3687409 if someone gets cut weve got the best surgeon well stitch them up well get them back on the pitch
3687410 the catalytic cracking unit is our main gas producing engine at the refinery
3687411 its your finishing unit its like running a doughnut factory without a deep fryer youre just not able to finish off the product and get it to market
3687412 if anything i said can be interpreted as sexist i unequivocally and wholeheartedly apologize and withdraw my comments
3687413 i have always been a strong supporter of women in politics and want to encourage not hinder their participation in the public sphere
3687414 if they wanted to take me out i would think youd get someone whos looking forward to building a political career not somebody whos at the age where hes considering retirement
3687415 seeing the reaction of people today it would seem my comments were reflecting on the larger group or women in general and that was not the intention of my comment so i thought the only way to put it to bed was to issue an apology and retraction
3687416 when you live in a fish bowl you gotta watch how you swim
3687417 stephane dion must show that these comments are not acceptable in the political process and immediately reprimand his caucus members
3687418 its upsetting and ridiculous to hear this from an elected official
3687419 it should never have happened in the first place there has to be a direct apology to marjory lebreton and i just think its an assault on those who are running and those who would think about running
3687420 why didnt rona ambrose speak out when peter mackay called belinda stronach a dog
3687421 i think its kind of short sighted on her part or anyone elses to insist that thibault be reprimanded
3687422 the reality is that were faced with a slowdown and right now were seeing the commodity trade that whole momentum unravel quickly
3687423 theyre not making any major commitments to the market canada is facing economic headwinds
3687424 when the dollar quits going up gold quits going down its going to take time to repair this dont look for a quick turnaround
3687425 but given the rally we had last week were still holding on if you look at the big picture we were due for some kind of a break
3687426 if were going to compete internationally for the best and for the brightest we need to improve the way that we attract and retain those who want to work in their fields and contribute to canadian society
3687427 theyre good enough to work here but we dont want them to become canadian citizens
3687428 thats 90 per cent of the 165 000 temporary foreign workers who are working in canada right now
3687429 with nearly full employment an aging population and skill shortages there is an immediate need to ensure canadian employers can access the skills they need
3687430 the decrease in sales stems from an ongoing decline in the level of consumer confidence in canada as well as a decline in housing starts and resale of single unit homes especially in alberta
3687431 this situation combined with a decrease in housing starts and resale of single unit homes in canada especially in alberta will continue to put downward pressure on sales in our industry
3687432 housing prices affect consumer confidence so when you have a big boom like weve had in edmonton for the past four or five years people start to feel a little wealthier
3687433 theres a combination of things that are hurting consumer confidence right now like higher gas prices and housing would add to that
3687434 even though both companies are well run when the economy changes especially the housing economy and your business is home renovation and improvement thats going to hurt you more than it hurts even a wal mart that has some exposure to that hard goods category but has a lot of other categories to offset it
3687435 although our sales continue to be strong we are concerned about a general slowdown in the economy
3687436 people who have never seen anyone else show these expressions they have the same behavioural responses
3687437 an emotion like fear or anger you dont have to think about who you are
3687438 with pride you do im experiencing these emotions because i just did something that makes me feel good about myself
3687439 if you have a success its really important that other people in the group know that
3687440 pride is a clear signal look at me im powerful
3687441 in western cultures people dont talk about their shame whereas in eastern cultures especially asian cultures shame is an essential part of the cultural fabric
3687442 i know we wanted to have something hanging around our necks
3687443 i think any time you put up 10 runs in a game its a good one
3687444 any of the eight guys could be on the podium i have to calm down go relax and get focused
3687445 for us a few too many mistakes on the synchronized part
3687446 theres no margin for mistakes against these guys at least mistakes like we did
3687447 there is a still lot to be done here in new brunswick and its all about money and time science and education
3687448 its a never ending process because we are into environmental and climate change
3687449 we keep looking ahead to see what are significant areas that we might want to help protect that wouldnt get protected otherwise
3687450 a lot of those are on the tidal shores because there is a lot of change and erosion that goes on there others are on rivers and lakes
3687451 this is a site of international importance in the migration of hundreds of thousands of shore birds
3687452 this is just one of the examples of the kind of work the nature conservancy of canada does
3687453 this is the birds last refueling stop before flying 4 300 kilometres non stop over the ocean to south america
3687454 the protection of precious habitat across the entire province is our natural legacy to the future generations
3687455 we have now been able to protect the beach so we dont see that happen
3687456 there is nothing i fear after going through the low tide
3687457 i knew chen was special at the first sight of the girl when she was eight years old
3687458 her body structure seemed perfectly suited for weightlifting even then she could pull a cart loaded with 150 kg of sugar cane alone
3687459 when my goggles did fill up i knew there was nothing i could do all i could do was swim
3687460 i couldnt take them off i had two caps on so i couldnt rip them off i couldnt fix them i couldnt empty them out i just had to swim
3687461 i managed to get my hand on the wall and it wasnt perfect i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3687462 but he is maybe from a different planet a planet from a different galaxy
3687463 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3687464 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3687465 oh man i cant kick this thing this things a mess
3687466 its obviously not healed it had only been a month maybe and it kind of got split on the outside
3687467 i just love scoring no matter what no matter where it is
3687468 so scoring a goal in the olympics against a team like sweden is just a huge feat for me
3687469 shes such a great target player she has a nose for the goal
3687470 and with her there it allows kara lang to play wide right and were three pretty big players up top its nice to have her back
3687471 the ankle felt great and it was great to be out there and contribute in a hard game against sweden
3687472 who else wants to become the worlds greatest mom or dad without putting yourself to wits end in raising highly successful children
3687473 no doubt that clueless parents stop at nothing to become better at their missions
3687474 youll become so likeable that your kids friends might wish you were their parent too
3687475 auf dem programm wird sicherlich interessant ich freue mich auf die gespr che mit den workshopteilnehmern und bin gespannt welche themen der workshop agenda ihnen am meisten am herzen liegen
3687476 trig is beautiful and already adored by us we knew through early testing he would face special challenges and we feel privileged that god would entrust us with this gift and allow us unspeakable joy as he entered our lives
3687477 we have faith that every baby is created for good purpose and has potential to make this world a better place we are truly blessed
3687478 her choice to value life in a very personal way speaks volumes and gives those of us in the pro life community in alaska cause to believe that we truly do have a pro life leader in charge of our state
3687479 we have been growing at more than 200 over the last two years and to sustain this growth rate and help us with our inorganic growth plans we were looking for capital infusion from an investor that would add strategic and intellectual value along with financial investment
3687480 we looked into it reviewed the file and felt that payment was necessary
3687481 theres a real uniqueness to this case and thats why we decided to follow through with payment to cover the drug and medical costs of the family
3687482 his case points to the need to take a hard look at the health care system
3687483 there certainly will be others come forward we have people approaching the ministry all the time asking for out of province coverage some are covered some arent
3687484 because we brought it forward is not the reason why were following through with payment
3687485 we looked at it just from our perspective within the ministry as to what our obligations were and felt that we needed to follow through on this compensation
3687486 i think there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic director picked the best voice and the best performer
3687487 i think maybe on this one some people would believe that maybe it was not appropriate but the others would have said its fantastic because the performance was great
3687488 you can have different opinions but sport is exactly the same
3687489 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
3687490 i dont agree with the decision because they are kids and it may scar them for life
3687491 i think the girl with the voice should have a chance to perform at the closing ceremonies it would be a great chance for her to redeem herself to the world

3687530 paris hilton says that she wants to create an animated show about a superhero based on herself
3687531 part of the big challenge we have over the next four to six months is to do this complete audit and inventory of just what is out there
3687532 the eight regional health authorities all had individual deficits and im sure there are some things upon which well save as time goes on
3687533 the fact that youve got one region buying equipment and representing four organizations makes the price a lot cheaper
3687534 and all of a sudden you want a magnetic resonance imaging system or three of them in the province of new brunswick its one tender as opposed to three different organizations at different times doing it
3687535 were buying in bulk for one organization and those savings are going to be in the multimillions of dollars
3687536 it will be a lot smarter way to do business
3687537 weve saved a couple of million dollars on the administrative consolidation but thats not going to bail the deficit out at this stage of the game
3687538 theres a lot of patients who are using these medications who may not need these or may be able to use a different medication that doesnt have these side effects

3687540 even those who dont die as a result of it theyre still often left with significant disability and loss of independence
3687541 furthermore use has been increasing in recent years likely because of a number of factors including increasing affordability with the emergence of generic and over the counter formulations
3687542 i think patients who are on these medications should discuss it with their physician

3687633 well then i guess im smelling them on you still from here
3687634 how many steps can you do it in t j
3687635 ideally youd like to be able to see the defense take one step and name everything about their defense
3687636 were doing that because once weve gone through our checklist we can eliminate a lot of things
3687637 for example if the sam linebacker is on the end of the line then theyre not in cover two then once youve eliminated a lot of options youre able to look at tendencies thats where studying film helps if youve watched a lot of film you know that a certain guy might only look at you if hes blitzing combine those tendencies with what youve eliminated and youve got a good idea of whats going to happen

3687644 i write to you on behalf of aafia siddiqui phd a 36 year old muslim woman and pakistani citizen who is in pre trial detention at the metropolitan detention center mdc in brooklyn new york dr siddiqui is not allowed by the federal bureau of prisons bop to have contact visits that is she is not allowed to come into physical contact with anyone
3687645 despite this the bop and staff at the mdc are insisting that dr siddiqui endure the humiliation of a so called strip search each and every time one of her lawyers come to visit her for purposes of defending her in the united states district court on criminal charges
3687646 the inmate is required to be stripped naked and checked to find he she is not hiding anything on his her body
3687647 i think you will agree that this type of strip search is not only humiliating and degrading but is also offensive to a woman who is a devout muslim as is dr siddiqui
3687648 i write to you to implore that you demand in the strongest terms that the united states government bureau of prisons and metropolitan detention centre employees cease and desist the practice of strip searching dr siddiqui which in her case is totally unnecessary because she is not allowed to have contact visits with her attorneys or anyone else anyway dr siddiqui has been through a horrendous time and this is adding to the colossal emotional distress already inflicted on her by the united states in afghanistan for five years and in pakistan when she was abducted in 2003

3687714 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

3687718 the law is quite clear clubs pay for any policing inside the ground and on immediately adjacent property under their control on matchday
3687719 any other provision deemed necessary is covered by the state its what people pay their taxes for with the premier league alone contributing more that 700m a year to the treasury let alone the tax take from the 13m fans who attend premier league games during the course of a season
3687720 this long established principle applies to all individuals and organisations in the uk from private individuals to shopping centres pubs and major events like the notting hill carnival
3687721 we are always happy to discuss how it might be possible to further reduce costs or how football can help the police tackle youth crime but we fail to see why football fans should pay twice for policing

3687725 helmets can greatly reduce the risk posed to young cyclists and anything that encourages the use of this equipment is to be welcomed

3687728 karen and i are delighted at the energy and innovative way that the charity has in getting out the important message to children on wearing helmets
3687729 as a racing driver i am only too aware of the need for helmets and the protection value that they offer and therefore we are delighted that we have been able to contribute to the charity to help them run this great scheme

3687739 i dont think he has the tricks to play wide
3687740 i dont think he will because it doesnt look to me that he has the dribbling skills
3687741 i dont have much choice its a young one or a younger one

3687743 im not panicking because we have worked very hard with these young players to build them up johann djourou for example will play if he cannot play one game like this one then we are wasting our time

3687745 after his time with england he went to holland and it is a good way of restarting your career its good as well to position yourself as an international coach
3687746 he has moved away and i think its bold when you go abroad you need to convince people that you can do the job when you go to a foreign country its always expected that you do better than the local people the expectation level is always higher
3687747 because if he comes back to england he comes back to arsenal

3687751 manchester united made an offer for david silva but this has been turned down by valencia
3687752 silva doesnt want to play in england because he is happy at valencia his family are settled and if he was to move it would only be to another spanish club like real madrid or barcelona david silva will start the new season at valencia

3687770 the scenario of the training was the following the situation was held within a built up inhabited area as the terrorists carried out sudden attack over the inhabitants the georgian and american militaries patrolled and evacuated and rescued the citizens if any of the inhabitants were wounded the soldiers administered medical assistance and transported them to the appropriate facilities after this the military servicemen implemented the clearance operation from the terrorists within the inhabited area

3687793 the worst thing we can do as a nation is taking the easy way out
3687794 the coast of south carolina is a cash cow out there in american controlled waters is a lot of oil and gas so lets go get it
3687795 the volume of oil spilled and impacts to shore from the offshore infrastructure were categorized as minor
3687796 onshore impacts from localized tank failures resulting from flooding were more significant
3687797 you cant get around running right through some type of habitat to accomplish this so you end up having some type of impact as youre coming up and making landfall
3687798 in our area as sensitive as estuarian habitats are thats an area of concern
3687799 direct mortality and displacement of any of the species there
3687800 one of the most extensive untouched deep water coral habitats in the world
3687801 the geology of north america is really well known so we know where the potential areas of gas and oil are
3687802 south carolina isnt one of those places after you start looking at the numbers the whole argument about exploration becomes extremely bogus
3687803 oil companies do not chase ghosts it costs too much when nothing is there
3687804 oil exploration is a science and if the geology looked good then there would have been seismic ships off our coast looking for oil and oil companies wanting to explore their absence from the area says it all there is no oil
3687805 if more federal acreage was made available under prudent environmental standards conocophillips would likely invest even greater amounts in the search for oil and natural gas in the u s
3687806 all i know is whenever i watch discovery is they say off the coast of south carolina i dont know how far out theres millions of barrels of oil
3687807 the geologists could be environmentalists they might have been born again as far as being greenpeace advocates
3687808 while the other members of the general assembly are doing their jet skiing and polo and horseback riding and whatever theyre doing during the summer months
3687809 all i know is if theres oil out there we want to find it and if we find it were going to drill for it and if we drill for it were going to make it right for everybody
3687810 the bottom line is weve got to be free of these third world countries dictating policy and making our lives miserable any time that they can because theyve got the power over our oil
3687811 threatens our coast our economy and our jobs while not doing one single thing to lower gas prices
3687812 even if increased domestic drilling activity could affect the price of gasoline there is yet no justification to open additional federal lands because oil and gas companies have shown that they cannot keep pace with the rate of drilling permits that the federal government is handing out
3687813 the fact is that the nation simply cannot drill its way to lower prices at the pump
3687814 oil and gas companies would not buy leases to this land without believing oil and gas can be produced there
3687815 weve gone after our easy to get cheap oil and what were left with are reserves that require more energy and money to extract theyre waiting on gas prices to get to a point where it makes it economically viable to pump it out of the ground
3687816 until we have five six or seven dollar gasoline it doesnt make sense theyre simply taking advantage of the fact that weve got 4 gasoline and were in an election year to try and get this moratorium lifted so they can put these leases on the books and theyre reflected on wall street that they have these reserves under their control

3687850 the next year will be a difficult one with inflation high and broadly flat but with monetary policy focused on its task of bringing inflation back to the target we will come through the adjustment
3687851 the tone is clearly dovish with the economy now expected broadly to stagnate over the next year or so
3687852 against that background we stick to the view that interest rates will eventually fall very sharply once inflation pressures finally recede market rate expectations therefore have scope to fall much further in time

3687865 mondello is a whiz kid who used his smarts and savvy to rip off software makers and consumers
3687866 we are fortunate that he has been stopped but there are hundreds more like him running illegal operations on ebay and other sites the mondello case demonstrates that these pirates wont simply get a slap on the wrist when caught they very well may end up doing serious time in federal prison
3687867 we applaud the doj and dhs for their work in bringing mondello to justice they did an outstanding job of tracking down mondello and bringing him to justice their action is an important step in protecting unsuspecting consumers software makers and legitimate software sellers
3687868 weve been much more aggressive in filing lawsuits this year and intend to send a clear message that auctioning counterfeit and unauthorized software will lead to serious penalties
3687869 to say this was in bad taste is an understatement

3687902 as the shipping provider has already planned a trip along the same route there are virtually no additional fuel costs this allows the shipping provider to pass the savings on to the customer with massively discounted rates and without the high fuel surcharges that are commonly added
3687903 users arent just saving money but theyre also helping reduce climate change shipping greatly contributes to climate change and with droppingby com matching up customers with shipping providers who have empty space in their vehicles it will save thousands of unnecessary trips and millions of wasted miles that are traveled every year this dramatically reduces carbon emissions and helps to reduce climate change
3687904 all shipping providers must be licensed and insured and also pass a 10 point inspection process before becoming a verified shipping provider not forgetting the feedback system where users can view details of other users previous conduct
3687905 it genuinely will enable people to ship their items at hugely discounted rates and at the same time they wont need to worry about the rising price of fuel affecting their shipping costs im also incredibly proud that were doing our bit in the fight against climate change

3687930 i have talked to you in the past via your blog leading smart about the copyright issues at granger i very much
3687931 after reading your book and continuing to read your blog i have to admit i was wrong i want to apologize for way i viewed your church and your motives the book gave me a great insight into why you do what you do at granger it also helped me express my philosophy on media in the church i love the missional mindset that comes thru i am all for using pop culture in the church i have always believed that the thing i have had a hard time with is the misuse when the church turns into a show and pop culture is just used because it is cool instead of using to to express a point and speak to people in there own language that was why i had a hard time with granger in the past looking from the outside it just seemed to be a show but after reading more and dropping my guard i am grateful for what you are doing at gcc

3687934 that may be by the time he got through working on it that was probably true
3687935 thats easily to be understood from his comments and i just beg to differ with that because the fact of the matter is all the stuff that i saw reported were reports on things the president said from his own mouth
3687936 most people thought that the most telling thing back in january was the equation that the president made of jesse jackson having won south carolina caucuses 20 years earlier and compared that with obama winning the south carolina primary theres a big difference in a caucus and a primary
3687937 and so a lot of that irrespective of what the president may have meant by the statement a lot of people interpreted that as having a racial connotation and jim clyburn didnt speak on that issue at all
3687938 i dont know that ive done any surveys to determine whether or not the president former president has ever damaged himself or not
3687939 my gut tells me that some things i ought to keep to myself
3687940 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit

3687942 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
3687943 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
3687944 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3687945 how in the world can that happen the answer is you dont know
3687946 i want her to admit she did something wrong i think people need to be held accountable for their actions

3687968 sania and leander have done a fantastic job for indian tennis by performing so well on the world stage they have brought attention light on this great nation of ours
3687969 leander will be remembered as a true patriot one who has served his country with undying devotion
3687970 leander has kept the indian flag flying high for the past 19 years he has brought out the best in him whenever he has played for the country players like him come very rarely

3687972 she has broken all barriers for indian women and has encouraged many young girls to take up to tennis she has shown that indian women not only can play sport but can also make a mark on the world stage
3687973 i can see for myself that more and more girls are picking up tennis thanks to sania i think its a great achievement to break into the top 30 and stay thereabouts for so long

3687984 there is no regret if israel decided to cancel the lull and hamas is ready to defend the dignity of the palestinian people

3688129 the crisis of identity which is everywhere normal in adolescence has become a grave problem in america extending far beyond adolescence and through young adulthood possibly there are many who never really resolve this problem in our society one of the characteristics of mass society is precisely that it tends to keep one from fully achieving ones identity from operating fully as an autonomous person from growing up and becoming spiritually and emotionally adult

3688155 muir weaves commentary thoughtful analyses and humor into a true art form
3688156 muirs genius lies in his giving context to the films
3688157 as a critic muir is acute in his analysis and as a writer he is easy to read
3688158 well grounded in the love and minutiae of sci fi and fantasy adventure
3688159 john kenneth muirs books for mcfarland are distinctive because of their authority and effective research
3688160 he really scrapes beneath the surface of the film and looks for the subtext every nuance is analysed
3688161 an independent film scholar muir explains film studies concepts in a language that is reader friendly and engaging

3688163 i have read quite a bit of horror film criticism and analysis in my day and john muir is one of the very best if not the best i have ever encountered

3688170 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3688171 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most

3688476 the aa has conducted numerous research projects into the effects of alcohol on driving and without exception each one has proven that drivers are already significantly impaired at the 0 05 limit
3688477 we are concerned that this limit is inappropriate in south africa where one is 14 times more likely to die in a traffic crash than in the united states
3688478 the aa fully agrees with the 0 02 limit for professional drivers
3688479 this allows some leeway for medications which contain alcohol but still emphasises that one alcoholic drink puts you over the limit the mixed message of having a different limit for ordinary drivers is impeding the fight against drunkenness on our roads
3688480 the more risk factors we can eliminate from the roads the safer theyll become
3688481 despite numerous efforts over the past 10 years there has not been a wide scale decline in the social acceptability of drinking and driving yet over the same period smokers have gone from being perfectly acceptable to social pariahs the difference is one of political will

3688502 we tried to mimic swedish massage because anecdotally its the most popular technique used by athletes
3688503 a review of the research in this area shows that despite the existing anecdotal evidence we know athletes use massage all the time researchers dont know the mechanism of how massage improves recovery after exercise and injury
3688504 our goal is to use this model to understand the biological mechanisms of massage as a guide to preclinical trials to test the effects of massage on muscle recovery after exercise a trial in humans could look at optimal indications for massage

3688559 maintaining a tight monetary policy stance and active fiscal and other methods are necessary to bring down inflation rates
3688560 the downward revision in the panels gdp growth outlook to 7 7 percent in fy09 is in line with our view that growth will moderate this year

3688572 purely economic the aim is to generate a steady stream of future workers for singapore inc
3688573 its not because having kids will provide a happy family life
3688574 its to bolster our economic competitiveness and indeed our economic survival after all no babies means no workers for the future right no workers means our economy will be affected

3688584 arroyo is insincere in her proposals for a surgical amendment of the constitution to supposedly incorporate federalism and achieve peace in mindanao there is no precise surgical amendment in her proposed constituent assembly because once constituted this constituent assembly can overhaul the entire constitution at its discretion
3688585 once congress is convened as a constituent assembly there is no constitutional restriction for the constituent assembly to revise not merely amend one or two provisions in the constitution
3688586 while amendment pertains to changes of one or two provisions revision means the power to change many provisions and even overhaul the entire constitution
3688587 it is therefore clear that arroyo is merely riding on the issues of federalism and peace in mindanao to push for charter change which is ultimately aimed at prolonging her stay in power and eliminating the protectionist economic provisions in the constitution

3688605 these people are finding each other and forming alliances they are conversing and sharing with each other their networks are amplifying their voices they are starting to have a real voice there has been a lot of talk for a long time but that talk has been largely dispersed across disconnected individuals who were unable to have any collective voice

3688617 it might seem odd that one of the goals of britains biggest branded truck company is to get trucks off the road but that is exactly what we are trying to do

3688632 i believe that we need to create a special committee in the u s senate to exercise oversight over contracting abuses related to reconstruction and the wars in iraq and afghanistan

3688643 were not yet at the stage when were ready to say anything definitive publicly but were certainly taking the plans forward
3688644 were getting very much further down the line and in the next month or two well finalise our plans
3688645 ive always wanted to bring the fans closer to the pitch what weve done in lengthening the pitch by two and a half metres either side already looks better
3688646 while its nowhere near what id want its a step in the right direction
3688647 its certainly a long term project if were talking about new stand development as part of an almost wider urban development plan for the site and im using the word if because existing refurbishment is still very much a consideration then its a possibility
3688648 weve got wasted space inside the stadium there are so many possibilities as a builder myself there are often very practical reasons why you cant go down route a so you have to go down route b or c
3688649 for example in the north bank the two towers either end were put in to save 50 000 so at present we can never fill in the corners because those towers instantly block your view
3688650 so if we did make it to the premier league and wanted to increase the capacity we have to rule out filling those two corners in
3688651 the reality is you try and take them both forward we can only invest in the team and the rest is up to the guys
3688652 what we can do is look into all the options with the stadium and hopefully take the stadium forward

3688656 in my mind jonathan brings versatility to my team and i do see him sometimes this season playing on the wing and not in centre midfield
3688657 sometimes he could play behind a striker or in a sitting role where he can dictate the game
3688658 ultimately i hope to have enough players in the squad when the window shuts so we have lots of different options
3688659 jonathan is another player with the quality required to play at this level and the quality to play in different positions in our team
3688660 im delighted hes part of our set up and im sure hes looking forward to the challenge of the premier league hopefully it will be a better season than the last time we were in this league
3688661 i see jonathan as a top player and a very high class footballer he still wants to learn as we all do and i include myself in that weve got a journey to go and weve got to learn as we go along
3688662 the premier league is somewhere where we want to be competitive every week and picking up victories along the way

3688671 the bus collided with the van and in turn moved off the road and hit a guard rail
3688672 we were able to get one of the passengers from the back of the van out onto the road but the others were certainly very seriously injured
3688673 but to be honest i have serious doubts that this will really happen there are many reasons for that especially on the practical side we all have our own lives our own bands and all kinds of things which we have to take care of this playing at festivals is already a very big step for me we can still have a look at all that once we have done all these festivals i think that after those gigs everybody will probably like to have some time off anyway in the beginning of our career we played so many gigs were not going to plan such a hectic tour schedule like we had in the past that would ruin everything were going to have a look at everything and then well see somebody already proposed a tour of two weeks through the states to us something like that is somehow realistic
3688674 i would be very surprised if that would really happen but never say never im always the last one who needs to be convinced michael amott guitar and jeff walker bass vocals are much more busy with those things than i am im also not very much involved in the planning of all the festivals which are scheduled at this moment i barely know in which countries were all going to play laughs

3688678 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3688679 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3688680 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3688681 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3688682 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3688683 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3688684 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3688685 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3688686 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3688687 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3688688 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3688689 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3688690 our only assumption could be that the person has a serious alcohol problem
3688691 this last option becomes the first in order not to let the situation go out of hand
3688692 kashmiris will continue to agitate peacefully and we should not give indian oppressors any chance to use brute force

3688723 bedrijven passen zich aan aan de krapte op de arbeidsmarkt en worden gedwongen om net even verder te kijken

3688728 people are fleeing there is a mood of absolute panic the idea there is a ceasefire is ridiculous
3688729 they asked villagers to hang white flags or handkerchiefs outside their houses if they did not want to be shot they say
3688730 behind them say eyewitnesses is a whole column of irregulars who locals say are chechens cassacks and ossetians
3688731 eyewitnesses say they are looting killing and burning these irregulars have killed three people and set fire to villages they have been taking away young boys and girls
3688732 we do not yet have a peace deal we have a provisional cessation of hostilities but this is significant progress
3688733 we have a tradition that in times of crisis the opposition stands united behind the president and does not attack him but georgia should not have advanced into tskhinvali south ossetias capital in so unprepared a way that was a grave error
3688734 the difference between lunatics and other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them
3688735 we will be forced to take other measures to prevent any repetition of the situation that emerged because of the outrageous georgian aggression
3688736 plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of russia
3688737 they shot their brother russian peacekeepers then they finished them off with bayonets so we are not going to see them there any more
3688738 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3688739 abkhazia and ossetia if i mention territorial integrity are to the best of my knowledge part of georgia
3688740 nato is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict
3688741 the press thinks were at war over salary with tori i didnt know i was at war with tori
3688742 im really bummed because i love tori and i was psyched tori was going to be on the show i think she should definitely get paid as much as either of us is getting paid
3688743 her father created the show it just seems wrong if thats the case i dont know what really happened because i havent talked to her i would like to talk to her
3688744 ill try to butt my head in whenever i can and tell people what i think about it
3688745 muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam is not the father of any man among you but he is the messenger of allah and the last end of the prophets
3688746 this day i have perfected your religion for you completed my favor upon you and have chosen islam for you as your religion
3688747 and whoever seeks a religion other than islam it will never be accepted of him and in the hereafter he will be one of the losers
3688748 by whom the soul of muhammad is in his hand no member of this nation no jew or christian hears of me and does not believe in what i was sent with but he will be of the people of the fire
3688749 and we have sent down to you o muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam the book this quraan in truth confirming the scripture that came before it and dominant over it
3688750 suitable for implementation at anytime anywhere and by any nation
3688751 it is he who has sent his messenger muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam with guidance and the religion of truth islam to make it superior over all religions even though the disbelievers hate it
3688752 allah has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds that he will certainly grant them succession to the present rulers in the earth as he granted it to those before them and that he will grant them the authority to practice their religion which he has chosen for them islam and he will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear provided they the believers worship me and do not associate anything in worship with me but whoever disbelieved after this they are the rebellious disobedient to allah

3688795 i think a drop of 20 percent is a bit over done
3688796 weve fallen too far too fast i expect the market to sit between 110 and 120 in the short term
3688797 have taken profits as theyve seen demand destruction in the u s and theyre seeing it spread a little into europe
3688798 u s gasoline demand last week was almost 4 percent lower compared to the same week in 2007 despite a considerable decline in retail prices
3688799 i dont think the numbers are signaling the type of deep recessions we saw in the late 1990s and early 2001
3688800 any slowdown in the japanese economy is likely to be relatively modest
3688801 we are of course not immune to the challenging environment around us and the sustained weakness across financial markets put pressure on earnings
3688802 combined with lower real estate and private equity valuations lower investment results accounted for the vast majority of the profit decline

3688821 it is important to bring fes case to the state industrial relations commission because this case is undermining the fundamental rights of an australian worker to at least have the minimum conditions of employment
3688822 i havent personally seen a case like this before but i would say its going on and it needs to be highlighted that fe was prepared to come forward and not as many people would probably be prepared to come forward
3688823 our priority is to get an outcome for fe to ensure justice is delivered for fe and with this case send out a message to employers to maybe think twice about doing whats happened to fe

3688893 i think that anybody who went to high school with me would be very surprised
3688894 i have always had this huge desire for acting and i was just lucky that i am able to do it ive a passion for the craft and for the film making
3688895 when i was 13 i joined a local theatre group and then i started doing commercials also my parents wanted to make sure i had a love of theatre and that was invaluable
3688896 i dont think i am beautiful i can look good and i can look ugly whats funny is that when i was younger i wanted everyone to look at me now i like to watch other people because you can learn a lot of interesting things

3688908 another pop more shooting pain and then it was like i dont have a foot lets finish this race
3688909 up and down four storeys in my apartment building that doesnt have an elevator
3688910 i didnt think that was allowed anymore id just hold the crutches and hop
3688911 but there wasnt a question that i wasnt going to the olympics
3688912 i knew id be fine my whole career since high school has been based on the goal of going to the olympics and competing well
3688913 so it was an easy jog into the pit one jump and into physio
3688914 i could keep on running and cross my fingers it would be all right
3688915 another pop more shooting pain and then it was like i dont have a foot lets finish this race
3688916 up and down four storeys in my apartment building that doesnt have an elevator
3688917 i didnt think that was allowed anymore id just hold the crutches and hop
3688918 but there wasnt a question that i wasnt going to the olympics
3688919 i knew id be fine my whole career since high school has been based on the goal of going to the olympics and competing well
3688920 so it was an easy jog into the pit one jump and into physio
3688921 ultimately and its hard to say with a straight face but star wars is a very small little personal story

3688923 i knew that there were clones against droids and i knew that the clones turned against jedi and that they were the precursor of the stormtroopers but thats about all i knew
3688924 since this is saturday morning television i said lets go back and find the retro reality when i was growing up which was thunderbirds

3688934 if england were to lose command of the sea it would be all over with her
3688935 we dont really have any plans to counter this thats just the way he plays hes extremely physical
3688936 thats what makes him the player he is but we wont change where we want to attack because of this or the way we want to play
3688937 that was a tough game for me and the team saturday will be just as tough but its one of those challenges we look forward to south africa at home is one of the sternest tests you are going to play but im looking forward to playing well because we werent great last time out at newlands
3688938 you are as only as good as your team mates and it all starts up front we need a platform from the forwards jimmy kicked extremely well at eden park and that took a lot of heat off me hopefully there will be more of the same of that on saturday
3688939 it will potentially have an impact on butchs play we saw the way ricky januarie can split teams up the middle with his break in dunedin but fourie is world class hes a great dictator and great reader of the game and that showed versus argentina
3688940 we dont really have any plans to counter this thats just the way he plays hes extremely physical
3688941 i know but what kind of confidence must you have to race a cheetah hes lightning quick his acceleration is phenomenal and he is unpredictable just an awesome player
3688942 but the collective is more important to us than any individual sure ive done some analyses on him but theres nothing we dont already know this springbok side is so good that if you focus on one player another is sure to hurt you the collective will be more important than any individual if the ball doesnt reach him he cant play thats the basic principle and one that will be doubly important with a winger like habana
3688943 theyve picked a side capable of playing in a number of different ways
3688944 so they very well may look to kick on me they have the players to do that in fourie du preez percy montomery and butch james but im not fretting about it ill deal with that if it happens
3688945 while im technically a winger the coaching staff have given me the freedom to play as a roving midfielder which is superb because it allows me to express all the skills i use there and i determine how much i get my hands on the ball i suppose it gives our backline attack an unpredictable edge
3688946 i dont want to spend my entire career switching between positions i want to become the best centre in the world
3688947 but at this stage ill take any opportunity that comes my way wearing the no 14 jersey so many great names have worn before is a privilege

3688993 die 13 familienbeihilfe nach dem vp modell bringt bereits wieder die n chste ungerechtigkeit f r junge familien sp und vp wiegen sich in einigkeit
3688994 der grundsatz dass in unserer gesellschaft alle kinder gleich viel wert sind scheint f r die beiden parteien nicht mehr zu gelten kinder unter sechs jahren sollen gar nichts erhalten gerade jene familien mit kleinen kindern die monatlich bis zu 300 euro f r den kindergarten ausgeben sind stark belastet f r diese zwei klassen gesellschaft bei kindern gibt es keine begr ndung
3688995 faktum ist eine alleinerzieherin mit zwei unter 6 j hrigen kindern erh lt gar nichts
3688996 wenn das alles an entlastung f r familien sein soll dann wei man was man von anderen wahlversprechen halten kann n mlich gar nichts
3688997 das bedeutet dass die 13 familienanpassung nicht einmal den verlust durch die inflation abdeckt
3688998 die gr ten ausgaben haben familien bei der kinderbetreuung deswegen braucht es eine gratis kinderbetreuung ab dem ersten lebensjahr
3688999 das w re eine massive entlastung aber das lehnt die vp offenbar aus puren ideologischen gr nden ab
3689000 mit dem 13 familienbeihilfenmonat wollen sie dar ber hinwegt uschen dass sie eine wirkliche entlastung ablehnen

3689004 die ereignisse der letzten tage waren schlimm genug die aufgabe heute ist die eindr cke nach der r ckkehr der franz sischen ratspr sidentschaft und des osze vorsitzenden alexander stubb aus georgien und moskau gemeinsam zu analysieren und zu erarbeiten wie wir in dieser situation am besten helfen k nnen beim akuten krisenmanagement wie auch bei den bem hungen zur konfliktl sung
3689005 die geschehnisse in der nachbarregion kaukasus ber hren nat rlich auch europa wir haben keinerlei interesse daran dass sich auf dem kaukasus die menschliche und politische trag die auf dem balkan in den neunziger jahren wiederholt daher sollte die europ ische union auch alles daf r tun um dazu beizutragen diese situation politisch zu entsch rfen und zu einer l sung aktiv beizutragen
3689006 wir haben die ersten schritte die die franz sische pr sidentschaft in diese richtung gesetzt hat voll unterst tzt und ich begr e dass sich frankreich so rasch und energisch f r uns 27 eingebracht hat
3689007 so weit sind wir noch nicht genau das ist eines der themen die wir heute besprechen werden mir ist sehr wichtig dass auch die m glichkeiten der osze und des europarates entsprechend eingebracht werden wir d rfen nicht vergessen dass russland und georgien mitglieder des europarates und der osze sind daher ist es auch gut dass sich carl bildt als derzeitiger vorsitzender des ministerkomitees des europarates hier so aktiv engagiert
3689008 dieser wahlkampf droht noch unfairer und untergriffiger zu werden als wir es erwartet haben
3689009 die fp weigert sich an fairen spielregeln mitzuarbeiten die f r alle wahlwerbenden parteien gelten
3689010 f r das liberale forum ist fairness programm bei anderen parteien mehr oder weniger ausgepr gt und bei der fp nicht vorhanden
3689011 nachdem die anderen parteien nicht in der lage waren ein fairness abkommen abzuschlie en schlie en wir ein fairness abkommen mit einem entsprechenden programm mit den w hlerinnen und w hlern
3689012 st rze passieren sehr oft wenn die treppe nicht an die bed rfnisse der benutzer angepasst ist das hei t wenn sie nicht dem nat rlichen bewegungsrhythmus des menschen entspricht so ist es sehr gef hrlich wenn die treppe zu steil ist oder wenn die stufen nicht tief genug sind dann ger t der mensch aus dem tritt es kommt zu unsicherheiten und zu st rzen
3689013 das gel nder sollte am besten senkrechte gitterst be aufweisen die maximal zw lf zentimeter auseinander liegen damit kinder den kopf dort nicht hindurchstecken k nnen waagerechte streben sollte man nicht verwenden denn diese verleiten zum dar berklettern und man muss sagen kinder sind wirklich wahre kletterk nstler
3689014 zum einen sollte man schon bei ganz wenigen stufen einen handlauf anbringen zum beispiel wenn man eine kleine gartentreppe hat oder den hauseingang der handlauf als solcher sollte so sein dass er weder zu dick noch zu d nn ist man muss ihn mit der hand gut umgreifen k nnen das probiert man am besten schon im gesch ft aus bevor man den handlauf kauft der dritte tipp ist dass der handlauf als solcher ein gutes st ck ber die treppe hinausragen sollte damit man wirklich sicher steht zu ebener erde und dann weitergehen kann

3689016 while this investigation is taking so long people are losing the trust that they had in the county government and it is a very big heavy cloud not only on the correctional officers but on the county

3689018 were awaiting the results of the investigation like everyone else
3689019 i think its unfair for ms dillard to criticize and to indicate that the county government is involved in any coverup nothing could be further from the truth
3689020 the white family is very disappointed in the progress of the investigation at this point
3689021 we want there to be a thorough and detailed investigation but we believe it could be done in a much more expeditious manner it has become painfully obvious that this investigation and the prosecution of these wrongdoers are well beyond those charged with those responsibilities at this time
3689022 we handled it as well as we could under the circumstances
3689023 we took precautions to make sure the temporary fix is safe

3689060 incentivizing sending a notification is prohibited but incentivizing an app action like superpoking is not banned even if that action typically leads to a subsequent notification on the other hand if an app provides bonus points for inviting friends or just for sending notifications that would be a violation
3689061 as noted in the blog post the new policies prevent applications from creating artificial or inappropriate incentives to use facebook features including for example sending requests and adding profile boxes generally awarding money or bonus points that can be used to do things in the application or elsewhere for sending invitations or for the acceptance of invitations falls under the intended scope of what is prohibited by the policies

3689092 poor general health record compared to other parts of the country
3689093 we are looking for stores in deprived areas that do not currently sell fruit and veg and or stores in less deprived areas where there are limited places to buy fruit and veg
3689094 we are relying on the convenience store groups to identify stores that meet these criteria and well then check to make sure weve got a good mix across the region
3689095 we know that families in some communities still use the corner shop on a daily basis for their food and other household goods
3689096 it is therefore essential we take healthy eating options to these stores and reach those families who are at the greatest risk of poor health due to a poor diet
3689097 consumer habits are shifting people shop around at different outlets several times a week so its important that people have the opportunity to buy fresh fruit and vegetables where it is convenient for them

3689176 on the first day of the week when we were gathered together to break bread paul talked with them intending to depart on the morrow and he prolonged his speech until midnight there were many lights in the upper chamber where we were gathered and a young man named eutychus was sitting in the window he sank into a deep sleep as paul talked still longer and being overcome by sleep he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead but paul went down and bent over him and embracing him said do not be alarmed for his life is in him and when paul had gone up and had broken bread and eaten he conversed with them a long while until daybreak and so departed
3689177 devoted themselves to the apostles teaching and fellowship to the breaking of bread and the prayers
3689178 and day by day attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes they partook of food with glad and generous hearts

3689213 cuando llegan los ataques de georgia rusia no se lo esperaba y hubo un cierto desconcierto sobre c mo proceder
3689214 en el gobierno ruso estaban los que optaban por una reacci n jur dica pero otros ve an este ataque georgiano como un golpe a rusia en un rea de important simos intereses geoestrat gicos rusos y es ah cuando se vio el papel de putin que act a una vez m s como el hombre fuerte de rusia medvedev es casi invisible y muy d bil es putin quien claramente afirma que rusia siempre ha tenido un papel estabilizador en la regi n y seguir teni ndolo y entonces viene la reacci n la venganza contra georgia e indirectamente contra ee uu
3689215 pareciera que los georgianos calcularon su operaci n con tanta inteligencia como los militares argentinos lo hicieron con las malvinas
3689216 los rusos estaban esperando ese paso en falso y con putin a la cabeza mostraron toda la crueldad y brutalidad con la que sin sonrojarse siempre pensaron la pol tica
3689217 no s si saakashviili es un cad ver pol tico depender de las fuerzas internas en georgia pero internacionalmente est debilitado aunque occidente est mostrando solidaridad con l mientras la crisis contin a en privado deben estar irritados por sus provocaciones

3689221 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3689222 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3689223 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3689224 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3689225 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3689226 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3689227 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3689228 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3689229 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3689230 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3689231 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3689232 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3689233 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3689234 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3689238 the iocs position is clear the media must be free to report on the olympic games
3689239 more time to reflect about this matter which the other two negotiators have agreed
3689240 but they need a bit of more time to reflect so they will do that
3689241 i am quite certain that all the of the parties are determined to find a solution
3689242 talks will never collapse as long as we have tongues
3689243 all workers must refuse to serve zimbabwean president robert mugabe and swazilands king mswati as well as their close associates and collaborators anywhere in the region so as to ensure that they indeed feel the isolation
3689244 it will affect the poor theres no doubt about it and thats why we are not calling for a 12 month campaign
3689245 so we actually have young children and pregnant women who need food now
3689246 we are concerned that the mediator has not taken cognisance of this contrary to the memorandum of understanding between the negotiating parties
3689247 the threats physical assaults torture and acts of arson that have characterised the period following the march 29 elections must be halted immediately

3689254 earlier this year because of a routing quirk we accepted a fill in date at a little old theater in knoxville
3689255 that experience reminded us of our roots both in terms of a stripped down gut bucket musical approach and the direct connection with the people who came to see us

3689260 i obviously need to change something in the spamassassin config to reflect the actual directory structure which is var mail lynn
3689261 the idea of having monitors what you call peacekeeping troops i wouldnt call them like that but european controllers monitors facilitators yes yes and yes that is how europe should be on the ground
3689262 there are no signs of the russians letting in anyone else
3689263 i dont really see it happening at the moment the russians are firmly in control
3689264 the international community will want to ensure that the message goes out that force is not the right way to take forward these difficult issues
3689265 when we start thinking about peacekeeping i think the eu should have a central role
3689266 the blame game and the tough talk will start at a later stage
3689267 i see no point in us getting lost in a long debate today about responsibility for and origins of the escalation of the last few days
3689268 you can decide to make strong statements with one sided condemnations or you can look to the future and take a real role in stabilizing the situation

3689284 so do the british and until now canada has been somewhere in the middle
3689285 the harper government has turned them into secrets and started censoring bits of them and now it seems they will disappear altogether
3689286 said the afghan government tortured well that embarrassed the harper government quite a bit
3689287 i think what is really going on is prime minister stephen harper does not want our allies to be shown up by our reporting of their problems
3689288 those are exactly the same sorts of things that the harper government cut out about afghanistan and now wants to do across the board
3689289 the aggressor has been punished the war had been on fire near about five days and left homes in smoldering ruins and uprooted 100 000 people
3689290 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3689291 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3689292 i think china is changed irrevocably after these 17 days it is a full aware part of the international community and they know that their behavior in that community is going to have to be different than in the past

3689300 established that conducting a conference call is the focus or a key focus of applicants audio or video teleconferencing services
3689301 because the term conference call names a key aspect of applicants teleconferencing services the term is generic for such services
3689302 completely devoid of evidence that the relevant classes of purchasers of applicants services recognize conferencecall com as a distinctive source for such services
3689303 clearly demonstrates that corporate pro bono is generic for applicants services
3689304 although applicant itself is not providing the legal services the term corporate pro bono identifies the central focus or subject matter of its services that is establishing or helping corporate counsel or corporate legal departments establish and manage programs to provide corporate pro bono a term that names the central focus or subject matter of the services is generic for the services themselves

3689319 no 2 is making emissions better and using less gas
3689320 we are targeting pickups suvs and vans thats the really big market

3689331 i did it i ate it all and then the cup became empty

3689371 today about 22 percent of adults over the age of 15 smoke in the 90s this was 37 percent
3689372 illegal tobacco is the single biggest threat to the industry we have established that about 20 percent of the total market is illegal that is 10 million cigarettes smoked a day are illegal that is a loss of r1 4 billion in taxes a year
3689373 it is not that people are smoking less it is that illegal cigarettes are not in the stats
3689374 we have found that a 10 percent increase in taxation on cigarettes results in a four percent decrease in the number of smokers
3689375 in south africa the invisible illegal economy is growing if you look at the history of the drug trade when you have something that is heavily taxed and easy to produce you get illegal trade so i would say that the percentage of illegal cigarettes smoked in sa is higher than 20 percent
3689376 in certain areas along the border i would say that 100 percent of cigarettes smoked are illegal
3689377 we believe we can halt it through partnership with government and cross border co operation with other countries this is however a long term operation
3689378 and if the people of the towns had believed and had piety certainly we should have opened for them blessings form the heaven and the earth but they belied the messengers so we took them with punishment for what they used to earn of evil deeds did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of our punishment by night while they were asleep or did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of our punishment in the forenoon while they play did they then feel secure against the plot of allah none feels secure form the plot of allah except the people who are lost

3689428 any player coming to spurs whether hes a big signing or just a ground staff boy must be dedicated to the game and to the club he must never be satisfied with his last performance and he must hate losing
3689429 bill did so much for his beloved spurs that we must never let his legacy fade he must be our inspiration as we strive to ensure that a new era dawns here at white hart lane
3689430 oh dear its f cked is what ive always taken it to mean i do have o level latin now theyve stuck up a literal translation in large letters to dare is to do the words just stand there on their own not making much sense

3689451 when the iphone came out we were excited about the big screen the graphics chip and the good components
3689452 we thought it was an opportunity too big to pass up
3689453 i showed it to my 92 year old grandmother who never used a mobile phone or the internet and she immediately understood the game
3689454 we have a lot of interest to do free branded iphone applications
3689455 marketers were hesitant initially they did not understand what applications would be popular or what the market would be
3689456 but now there are a lot of opportunities advertisers and agencies see this as a chance to develop original branded content
3689457 they realize there is a great opportunity in branded applications theyre not just boring banner ads
3689458 shes managed to come up with a fragrance thats quite delightful
3689459 i used to love to watch my grandmother put on her perfume
3689460 shed blot a little dab behind her ears it was such a classy ritual
3689461 these fragrances are more than doubling in volume while the market is declining
3689462 they are doing a good job at attracting the trendsetter customer who is looking to try out different things
3689463 there is a real passionate person out there who buys a lot of fragrances and knows when everything is out before it actually comes out
3689464 i have an overly sensitive nose and i dont like most scents
3689465 but this i really like its light it smells fresh its like it belongs on me
3689466 she had a very precise idea about the notes in her perfume
3689467 the fragrance she asked me to make was in a completely different range of my usual creations

3689471 the ceasefire on the georgian side was always in force
3689472 the russian side didnt respect any ceasefire they went to our towns they are rampaging and they are also shooting
3689473 georgia of course not georgia but the georgian leadership gave an order which led to an act of genocide which resulted in war crimes ethnic cleansing and this of course cannot go unanswered
3689474 as for the armed forces of the russian federation which were sent to south ossetia to reinforce our peacekeeping forces they will be withdrawn to russian territory depending on the extent to which the georgian troops go back to their barracks our peacekeepers will remain in south ossetia
3689475 the territorial integrity and belonging of south ossetia and abkhazia to georgia can never be put under doubt
3689476 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganised
3689477 you know the difference between lunatics and other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them so you have to use surgery as for claims by the georgian president that the ceasefire has been observed for two days thats a lie georgian forces continued to fire at peacekeepers unfortunately people were killed yesterday there was no ceasefire from the georgian side
3689478 we dont yet have peace but we have a provisional cessation of hostilities and everyone should be aware that this is considerable progress
3689479 we are working with an international community but all we got so far are just words statements moral support humanitarian aid but we need more we want them to stop this barbaric aggressor
3689480 as you know the enclaves of south ossetia previously controlled by the georgian government and by local administration headed by ethnic ossetian dimitri sanakoev has been ethnically cleansed by intruding russian troops and i get very worrying reports some of them look to be unfortunately credible of point blank executions on sight killings some people taken into some kind of camps or some internal places in kurta and vladikavkaz
3689481 we want to see the russians stand down what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression
3689482 they the americans of course had to hang saddam hussein for destroying several shia villages but the current georgian rulers who in one hour simply wiped 10 ossetian villages from the face of the earth the georgian rulers which used tanks to run over children and the elderly which threw civilians into cellars and burnt them they georgian leaders are players that have to be protected
3689483 the ferocity in which the actions of the georgian side were carried out cannot be called anything else but genocide because they acquired a mass character and were directed against individuals the civilian population peacekeepers who carried out their functions of maintaining peace
3689484 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3689485 we are really seeing absolutely unparalleled situation since many many decades in the world this is the most surreal world crisis i could ever imagine and its very unfortunate that it is happening in my country i insist that its happening unprovoked by us and i insist that it was all pre planned
3689486 regime change is purely an american invention purely an american invention we never apply this terminology in our political thinking and certainly we are all for democracy in georgia and its interesting that our american colleagues chose to bring up publicly this idea of president saakashvili stepping down
3689487 this is 100 unprovoked brutal russian invasion this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders we on our own cannot fight with russia we want an immediate ceasefire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
3689488 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
3689489 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
3689490 im deeply concerned about the situation in georgia the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
3689491 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory this is a clear intrusion on another countrys territory we have russian tanks on our territory jets on our territory in broad daylight
3689492 they were old and we were hearing that they dont want kennels anymore
3689493 the best thing to do was get rid of them
3689494 that someone would shoot 70 dogs rather than spend money to do a vet check is extremely problematic
3689495 if the definition of a puppy mill is putting profits over care of the dogs this is a stark example of doing that
3689496 there are others ways to take care of the situation like in a court
3689497 he could have treated the dogs with medication for 40 or 50
3689498 every humane society in the state would have taken those dogs
3689499 the independence and effectiveness of external audits in new jersey cannot be trusted unless changes are made
3689500 auditors probably shouldnt be in the business of writing checks in campaign season
3689501 these are professionals and we feel they do a very very good job
3689502 you need to have an auditor who is independent and has the right incentives to scrutinize the units books and records and not an audit firm thats focused purely on maintaining the contractual relationship for as long a term as possible
3689503 it probably is a good idea to have a new set of eyes looking at your books
3689504 ich mache einen bogen um zielgruppentypologien und den ganzen sermon aber wir bekommen eine menge e mails post und anrufe auf dem bananafon wegen unserer texte es ist halt etwas anderes wenn man eine firma einfach anrufen kann und eine viertelstunde mit den kollegen dort plaudern kann
3689505 in der zukunft wird es community manager innerhalb der marketing abteilungen geben m ssen das brand management muss mit dem kunden verlinkt werden
3689506 at 115 a barrel we see the industry turning a profit in 2009
3689507 if sustained is a game changing event for the industry
3689508 this isnt the same industry that gave us pause last march
3689509 this represents both the most rapid and most significant expense savings ever realized for the airlines
3689510 significant fall in oil prices has given airlines substantial breathing room even if demand does weaken
3689511 we look at the companies ability to pay their obligations their creditworthiness we still think airlines are fragile and they are burning through cash
3689512 its not outrageous to suggest that whats already been done may be enough to get the industry profitable in 2009
3689513 its ridiculous to talk about that number because there were so many changes made on that ship
3689514 habe anweisung keine konkreten termine zu nennen da die verteilung eintreffender iphones nicht nur von der wartezeit der bestellenden sondern auch vom vertragsumfang abh nge

3689517 the more severe their slowdown the greater the likelihood that it will begin to cool the boom in exports
3689518 the weak dollar has become a major driver of economic growth

3689520 is faring far better than the u s as a whole
3689521 of the 165 markets we track philadelphia performed better than 117 of them
3689522 because home values in the area arent dropping as significantly homeowners are holding on to more value and less are slipping into negative equity situations
3689523 while this may seem high on a national level almost one in three are in these situations
3689524 the longer this goes on the more homes that come on the market as people who have put off trying to sell because of the soft market finally decide to try their luck
3689525 i would never give it up not unless i was dying of alcohol poisoning or something
3689526 its inelastic demand as far as many of these stocks are concerned
3689527 were going to stop buying silly things like that as opposed to giving up going out for a drink
3689528 cigarettes in general can withstand such an environment better than many consumer products
3689529 if you try to get them on the phone you cant
3689530 if hes a day late sending in the payment they immediately add interest and penalties
3689531 in effect the brokerage company could have hired 100 convicted felons that committed fraud and that was ok
3689532 new jersey also requires lenders and brokers to register their loan officers and solicitors however the solicitors did not have to pass a test
3689533 mortgage referral agents think twice about having consumers accept or buy into predatory loans
3689534 even before the crisis occurred but harrisburg failed to act
3689535 there were some bad mortgage brokers just as there are some bad people in every industry
3689536 becoming a mortgage originator was too easy pay the fee fill out the paperwork and you could start originating loans
3689537 the law is a welcome change that will weed out many of the bad originators
3689538 i think it is about time that licensing has been addressed
3689539 every loan officer should need to comply with certain standards to conduct business
3689540 with the changes in the law the brokers association is changing membership levels
3689541 there will now be brokers and originators with originators paying a reduced fee but have the same services from the association as the broker
3689542 put your pride aside and get help a lot of people are not taking steps needed to avert foreclosure until it is too late its more difficult to overturn a foreclosure than avert one
3689543 you have exceeded your cpu quota by driving system load up almost to 20 normal system load is less than 10 your account is starting to cause service outages for other users on the server and re instating it will continue to cause slowdowns and problems for other users with that in mind what do you feel is fair in this situation
3689544 the only way to get more cpu resources is to purchase a dedicated server http hostgator com dedicated shtml however there are quite a few things that can be done such as installing wp supercache or another caching system and optimizing the database or using a theme that doesnt have so many callbacks
3689545 print one one thousand or one hundred thousand of your emails

3689578 we will never allow that georgia will be broken up into pieces
3689579 its a football term but if you do keep a clean sheet youve always got a chance of winning the game the lads did that and they were excellent especially brian jensen with a double save as well
3689580 for me he was man of the match tonight just for that in my opinion
3689581 i think it was very important that we came away with a clean sheet
3689582 i was always playing brian in goal regardless of what happened on saturday but i think it was very touch and go for who started the league season anyway because brian and diego penny have performed really well in pre season
3689583 ive always said even when you sign players and you bring them to the football club sometimes you get a tremendous response from the ones that are there and weve had that with brian
3689584 hes been fantastic all pre season and again he showed that tonight
3689585 thats what happens at football clubs you sign players other players then react to that and give themselves a kick start and i think brians done that
3689586 with the growing impact of websites mobiles and many other multi media forms the matchday programme is no longer a necessary purchase for football fans
3689587 in years gone by you would buy the programme to see who was in the team but these days that is not the case
3689588 we looked very closely at this and decided we needed to do something about it
3689589 we worked with our printers mercer print uk ltd and they told us about nine lives paper which seemed to fit perfectly with what we wanted to achieve it gives the new programme a different feel and style but one we hope supporters like
3689590 we have heard a lot about the credit crunch and the people of preston just like the rest of the country will have less spare cash in their pockets with rising living costs
3689591 we want people to be able to enjoy the full matchday experience and this year we have held matchday prices and lowered the cost of the programme so hopefully these two things along with the performance of alan irvines side will make people want to be a part of the new season
3689592 it is very important to us that the content of our programme is not just a rehash of interviews and features you can get elsewhere

3689611 i was held in a restaurant and physically and forcibly restrained there
3689612 i tried to explain to these people that i was a journalist but they dragged me out and slung me in in the back of a police van and held me there for another few minutes
3689613 nobody punched me but they were very forceful and i have a cut knee and a bruise on my finger
3689614 they basically dragged me into the restaurant and then out and took my shoes off me
3689615 i was able to eventually show them my journalist credentials and they realised i was a british journalist and the next time the door of the van opened i was able to walk out
3689616 they did ask me in english what my views were on tibet and i said i dont have any views im a journalist
3689617 i was there purely to report on a protest and took no part in the protest itself
3689618 we then contacted the british embassy and they are taking it up at consular level
3689619 we are aware of the incident and have spoken directly to john ray
3689620 we have expressed our strong concern to the chinese authorities and we are pleased that he has been released

3689708 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3689709 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3689710 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3689711 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3689712 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3689713 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3689714 ci ha legato per la vita e per la morte
3689715 tu sei il mio sogno la pazzia pi divertente chiusa dentro il cuore della gente la realt di mille sogni e non mi spaventa niente neanche questa specie di malinconia se ci sei tu a farmi compagnia
3689716 il mio destino stare da sola non posso scendere a patti con me
3689717 il mondo che sognavi no non esiste non esistito mai
3689718 non ho pi forza n coraggio la meta mia qual
3689719 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3689720 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3689721 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3689722 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3689723 nope just checking out what my kid sisters up to

3689725 wheres that dimwit brother of yours seven of spades is it
3689726 that not too nice coming from my boss is it
3689727 he doesnt need to know its no concern of his
3689728 its the only thing that makes me feel like an average girl
3689729 i dont think thats in the job description hey if you came home youd be normal well compared to six anyway
3689730 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

3689732 whats interesting about web 2 0 is that it gives you access to markets a small business owner couldnt normally reach
3689733 in the 17 years ive been breeding dogs ive never been as far as i am now with my business since building the blog site
3689734 now ive got waiting lists for puppies in fact as soon as the blog was up i started getting calls
3689735 any small business owner can use a blog as an online marketing tool but its more effective to combine it with google adwords to drive traffic a lot of professionals such as massage therapists and restaurateurs are also combining google adwords with online scheduling services and seeing an enormous increase in revenues
3689736 its easy to start a blog but its another to create an environment thats engaging enough to be an impactful part of your business
3689737 your efforts must be driven by core business needs and tightly aligning them with specific tactics
3689738 theyve taken the drivers seat by becoming the early adopters
3689739 thats because web 2 0 enables them to achieve a scale at an affordable price which was never possible before
3689740 if you can identify and reach out to influencers on a one on one basis it can be very fruitful with 100 million consumers actively reaching blogs businesses need to know the right place to get to the right audience with the right message at the right time
3689741 once youve done your flight planning then you can start doing outreach
3689742 there are a gazillion sites out there so you need to find your audience for a small business where you have to wear many hats its helpful to have a way to find the major influencers and prioritize your marketing it helps you gauge what people are talking about who is talking and what you need to watch out for
3689743 virtual merchandise just gives you a different way to connect with consumers and pilot new merchandise without having to go to the expense of making real goods
3689744 in the true smal business fashion we dont have funds we wanted to reach our demographic so we have to look to non traditional media channels
3689745 we saw there com as a very interesting social test to see what kind of reaction we would get to our new designs and over two years wed only have to sell 20 to 30 t shirts for the investment to pay for itself weve definitely hit that number already
3689746 you can tap into customers you can compete and innovate efficiently and effectively you can integrate blogs forums wikis and rss really simple syndication feeds to support activities that are unique to your products and ideas

3689754 there have been many challenges but the greatest one is probably trying to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of the organization both on and off the ice this takes time and being around the people on a daily basis i believe any strong organization starts with good people in the right places and now that i have spent a full year here i feel that i have a better handle on our strengths and weaknesses
3689755 mi hai fatto sognare con questo racconto ne scrivi un altro voglio sapere assolutamente la fine
3689756 ho pronto per te un contratto della mia casa discografica

3689760 dude thats in play get the heck off the wall
3689761 you look at kids they take their shoes off and run around all the time maybe his feet were hurting that day well educate him a little bit more and tell him about keeping his shoes on till he gets inside we dont like things to happen but they happen what can you do other than try to educate them
3689762 it would take a serious unexpected setback for him to be unavailable for the cowboys game
3689763 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3689764 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3689765 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3689766 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3689767 ooooh i shop at whole foods because i really feel that spending my whole paycheck to buy organic raw milk and imported cheese does something to save the planet
3689768 shes coming back here london in a few weeks then you can expect to see her popping up in the us after that
3689769 shes hoping to get work over there she wants to do similar tv and music projects to the stuff shes been doing here
3689770 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3689771 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3689772 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3689773 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3689774 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3689775 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3689776 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3689777 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3689778 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3689779 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3689780 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3689781 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3689782 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3689783 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3689784 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3689785 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3689786 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3689787 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3689788 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3689789 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3689790 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3689791 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3689792 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3689793 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3689794 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3689795 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3689796 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3689797 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3689798 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3689799 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3689800 who are open to doing something on the production side
3689801 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3689802 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3689803 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3689804 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3689805 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3689806 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3689807 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3689808 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3689809 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3689810 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3689811 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3689812 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3689813 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3689814 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3689815 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3689816 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3689817 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

3689837 bring top minor league professional mens basketball back to cleveland
3689838 unfortunately this course while it has an interesting reading list does not offer a non biased approach to the subject matter
3689839 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3689840 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3689841 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3689842 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3689843 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3689844 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3689845 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3689846 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3689847 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3689848 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3689849 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3689850 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3689851 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3689852 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3689853 fi fi fi fi fi fi fi fi ti devo una pinza fi fi fi fi fi fi fi fi ce lho nella panza
3689854 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3689855 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3689856 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3689857 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3689858 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3689859 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3689860 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3689861 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3689862 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3689863 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3689864 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3689865 would be required to pay hefty union dues and get nothing in return
3689866 how can it be bad to have a bargain at wal mart sure its held inflation down and its great to have bargains but you cant buy anything if youre not employed
3689867 we have sort of become a nation of whiners you just hear this constant whining complaining about a loss of competitiveness america in decline
3689868 im going to be honest i know a lot less about economics than i do about military and foreign policy issues i still need to be educated
3689869 guns have little or nothing to do with juvenile violence the causes of youth violence are working parents who put their kids into daycare the teaching of evolution in the schools and working mothers who take birth control pills
3689870 conservation may be a sign of personal virtue but it is not a sufficient basis for a sound comprehensive energy policy
3689871 guns have little or nothing to do with juvenile violence the causes of youth violence are working parents who put their kids into daycare the teaching of evolution in the schools and working mothers who take birth control pills
3689872 we have sort of become a nation of whiners you just hear this constant whining complaining about a loss of competitiveness america in decline
3689873 an error has occurred while establishing a connection to the server when connecting to sql server 2005 this failure may be caused by the fact that under the default settings sql server does not allow remote connections
3689874 id go id probably go like milan or something like that where i grew up or something like that peace out do you know any reasonable person that would turn down 50 million dollars because i grew up in italy it has more significance to me because im more familiar with it ive been there and i still have friends there im thinking about buying a house out there it would be nothing to me to be able to do that
3689875 if someone wants to throw 50 million on the table for me we can talk
3689876 they throw 30 40 50 million a year at me i cant turn that down i think right now its very exciting theyre starting a new buzz you start to do a little research and they got money over there you stay in the states you make the max you make 18 million take out taxes and you have 9 10 you have an opportunity to go somewhere and make 25 30 tax free we might have to pack our bags
3689877 it would definitely be something id consider you can never say never to anything the olympics have shown how this game has grown its not just the united states game anymore its the worlds game
3689878 as a businessman i would have to consider it if my wife was down and the money was right
3689879 from a business standpoint you have to at least listen to every offer
3689880 youre right only cska dynamo and khimki are the teams with huge money in europe along with olympiakos and panathinaikos from greece so if we are talking about lebron or kobe or any other superstar it all comes down to these five teams bc triumph formerly dynamo moscow region surprised everybody by signing krstic to a three million euro per year deal but its their only big buy so far and nobody knows what will happen next i think it is possible that one of these teams will find the money for an nba superstar yet 50 million is still outlandish were not talking about going roughly from 25 million team payroll to 32 million as was the case with childress but going from 25 million to 75 million it would make a little more sense if we were talking about what would be a 50 million a year nba contract which would equal about 17 million euros per year im sure that teams are preparing for talks and nobody is actually ready to just throw out 50 million now anyway its hard to predict anything because this will be an unprecedented move that will change the way we think now about sports contracts cska used to be the team paying crazy salaries compared to other teams in europe but for the last several seasons they have been coached by ettore messina and instead of chasing big names they try to get players that will fit the system this season when everyone is signing superstars the biggest names cska got are zoran planinic and erazem lorbek they are not the team that puts all their eggs in one basket messina is only signed until next summer though so well see what happens also cska has the most success in terms of public relations is well known everywhere in the world and they may be ready to spend to make the next step in these terms if youre nike youd want your player to be in moscow which is one of the world capitals playing for a well known team khimki have been big spenders for several years and this summer they went over the top the reason for that is they are hoping to get a contract with euroleague next summer when it could become a closed league it was announced that euroleague will look at marketability of the teams so khimki signed not just quality players but well known players from nba teams and successful national teams in carlos delfino and jorge garbajosa they went for the biggest names they thought they could target each player received what would be a 9 million a year nba contract the euroleague contract talks will continue next summer and if khimki are desperate to sign the deal they will have to spend crazy money actually if i were the euroleague i would quietly put pressure on the team and say you get lebron and well sign you to a euroleague contract on the other hand this is a smaller city in moscow region dynamo has a reputation of an underarchieving team here in russia they spend cska like money on their roster yet the results are very different this year they finally got a great coach in david blatt and also signed bostjan nachbar to what would be again a 9 million nba contract they are rumored to be targeting ben gordon now that its known that players of this caliber are available for the right money once again its impossible to tell how far the team can go in terms of spending because whats happening now is unprecedented for years dynamo has been the richest team that is not in the euroleague and they are desperate to get in the league still it is not surprising that it was a greek team which was the first to hand out a huge contract their owners have the most freedom to act because they are just that owners one person for each team russian teams have to find sponsors for each deal either from businesses or local governments which takes time and pursuasion sic if a greek owner feels like spending it will take him a second to give a go ahead to team management eccentric billionaire fan owners is not what russia is about
3689881 even more enticing to james has to be the revelation that earl boykins recently signed contract with italys virtus bologna includes income from bolognas sponsorship and marketing arms due to the nbas collective bargaining agreement this sort of arrangement is off limits in the nba but its exactly what lebron james inc is looking for james is right he wont become a billionaire by playing basketball so he and his management team have begun to look for more than endorsement dollars theyre now interested in equity stakes in the companies lebron lends his name to what if the owners of cska moscow or olympiacos the two teams reported to have contacted james offered him equity stakes in the teams and or outside business ventures they accumulated their billions in in addition to his playing salary an equity stake in a billion dollar business would pay dividends long after james called it quits on the hardwood and it would inch james closer to his stated goal of becoming the richest man in the world if the nbas collective bargaining agreement allowed it you can bet that james would negotiate an ownership percentage in the cavs or the soon to be brooklyn nets or the new york knicks any discussions between james and olympiacos or cska moscow will begin with what the euroleague can offer that the nba cannot
3689882 i wonder if the nba will be forced to adopt an mls style
3689883 european teams have rules that limit the number of non european teams that can be on their roster
3689884 but seriously cleveland cant pay 50 million for lebron nor should any american team pay that
3689885 cleveland shouldnt pay nor should any american team yadda yadda
3689886 hes treating and hes frustrated as well but hes got a great great attitude
3689887 from all indications everyone feels great about madieu getting back on the field and being 100 percent soon
3689888 i think i earned a little bit of respect when i was out there friday playing with them and made a few touchdown saving tackles
3689889 thats how you earn the defenses respect just by making plays
3689890 it was just good to see him out there with the lights on
3689891 he had to make a couple of tackles in the back end which all you care about when it gets to you right there to get him on the ground and he did a good job of doing that
3689892 my guard is still up can it be this easy can my responsibilities be this easy thats the biggest thing just relaxing and playing
3689893 if youre talking you know what youre doing you just call it out
3689894 i could imagine it makes the coaches a little bit more comfortable but it makes me a little bit more comfortable calling it out and making sure everybodys on the same page
3689895 only to learn that she couldnt recognize one goddamn song from an album that i thought was handed out with every 10th grade class schedule
3689896 o k honey i get it go ahead and play what you want
3689897 and when the rain is falling i dont hear it cause youre here with me now

3689904 will retain ownership of these highly successful businesses and move to integrating with them our existing franchise in australia and new zealand
3689905 we are confident that in combining our existing products and customer base with abn amro we will deliver a highly competitive offering into this important market
3689906 the situation changed over the last couple of weeks with the impact of statements that came out of melbourne with regard to a couple of banks nab anz and their respective positions which has had some impact internationally on the reputation of australian banks and the ability to access international funding markets
3689907 it wasnt the funding of the purchase price it was the funding of the liabilities the assets in the business
3689908 we came to the view that in the current market it probably wasnt a wise situation for us to be in
3689909 todays announcement provides us with ownership certainty and confidence in the business going forward

3689911 a triple whammy of cracking down on would be dumpers quicker clearing up by councils and soaring metal prices are helping to win the battle against unsightly old bangers being left on our streets
3689912 a few years ago youd have had to pay someone to take your old car away but now scrap metal dealers will pay you up to 1 000
3689913 the price has definitely increased at the moment we are paying between 100 and 150 for a scrap car
3689914 fiorina is a remarkable american success story and one of the nations great business leaders
3689915 her business experience will be vital to senator mccain and the rnc as we travel the country talking about the senators plans to create jobs for working families and set the conditions for economic growth
3689916 the question is does she really have the political experience to be vice president
3689917 she is a very formidable person but i dont think she has the required qualifications to be the vice president
3689918 her knowledge of technology goes a long way to addressing some of the concerns in the mccain campaign
3689919 she has an understanding of what it takes to maintain an edge in technology
3689920 we want to cultivate markets around the world and she has a good understanding of that
3689921 her experience at hp and her knowledge of the industry go a long way
3689922 i think she would actually force the administration to deal more aggressively with flaws in the american education system and enhance math and science learning at the k 12 levels
3689923 one of the keys to maintaining a competitive edge in technology is to develop educational institutions that can train the engineers who are capable of advancing existing products developing new ones and maintaining the competitive edge
3689924 hes using her as a visible outreach to hillary supporters
3689925 hes using her to show that he listens to female voters and that hes interested in courting those voters
3689926 the hillary clinton factor has made her a more attractive candidate
3689927 her addition to the ticket could provide mccain an opportunity to win over democrats particularly older women who were staunch supporters of hillary clinton
3689928 we can see her influence in how theyre using youtube
3689929 part of that is her influence and her understanding of technology theyre suddenly becoming aware of how important the internet is
3689930 shes not nuanced enough to know how to handle hot button issues like abortion
3689931 i didnt spend much energy on the way out and just used all my energy on the second lap and it went pretty well
3689932 im happy to make the final for the fourth time in a row
3689933 but it gives me confidence i can swim my own race under pressure
3689934 we meet again tomorrow what counts then is the title and not the record
3689935 only three of us have won the 100m freestyle ever in the olympic games and i would love to see another one
3689936 i think the 100m is still regarded as the blue riband event i will be there jumping up and down
3689937 it is one of my fastest times in the past couple of years so i take a lot of confidence going into the final
3689938 het zijn goedkope krachten ze mogen veel minder dan zestienplussers maar doordat ze nieuw zijn op de arbeidsmarkt zijn ze vaak niet op de hoogte van hun rechten en plichten ze vormen een kwetsbare groep
3689939 no you just have to ride like you never have to breathe again today i just concentrated on riding as fast as i could being absolutely smooth and enjoying myself without anyone to push me off
3689940 it helps being positive and nervous because youve been waiting four years for this i was enjoying going fast it was pretty fun i just kept saying faster faster
3689941 theres no secret you just have to make it hurt imagine a friend sitting on your wheel shouting at you
3689942 i almost gave up two years ago but then went to australia and just loved cycling again
3689943 you dont get paid a lot of money so it is all about enjoyment and glory i had to start to enjoy it again
3689944 at this stage weve had about 20 people present to us as identified pilgrims indicating theyre needing to seek protection in australia
3689945 it might well be that at the end of those three months we see a spike in applications for protection
3689946 we are seeing utter destitution we see malnutrition we are seeing depression we see homelessness people are coming to us from a place of crisis
3689947 there are still a number of people in the community who came out during world youth day there is certainly an expectation that some will decide to seek asylum rather that return
3689948 does obrien have authority to speak about for the black community

3689950 dat het denken over het juridisch ouderschap zich in de loop der jaren heeft ontwikkeld van een strikt op biologische verhoudingen gerichte rechtsfiguur men denke aan de aloude wettiging van kinderen tot een meeromvattende regeling waarin ook plaats is voor anderen dan de biologische ouders die bereid zijn het juridisch ouderschap te aanvaarden

3689953 hoe raar het ook klinkt we hadden een goede race we snappen er ook h l maal niets van
3689954 i will make sure that we keep you up to date and involved with all of the convention activity
3689955 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what were looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country
3689956 senator obama and i share the goal of ensuring that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
3689957 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
3689958 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
3689959 no decisions have been made and so we are trying to work all this through with the dnc and with the obama campaign
3689960 sen clinton is 100 percent committed to helping barack obama become the next president of the united states
3689961 she is very appreciative of the continued commitment of her supporters and understands there are passionate feelings around the convention while no decisions have been made at this time they will be made collaboratively with sen clinton and her staff the dnc and sen obamas campaign and released at the appropriate time
3689962 completely idiotic idea that leads to nothing but party disharmony
3689963 its a reflection of genuine frustration by hillary clinton supporters that sen obama seems to have forgotten about 18 million voters
3689964 my concern about sen obama is he doesnt recognize that the outreach to the clinton grass roots has to be more visible more overt as well as more symbolic
3689965 we are working together to make sure the fall campaign and the convention are a success
3689966 at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
3689967 her supporters want after 18 million votes and the record of success from march 1 through june 1 to feel recognized and i think we should
3689968 we will have this in hand for sen clinton should this be needed
3689969 its been a tradition since the late 1800s its a nominating convention you vote you nominate someone and you come out unified i dont see how alienating 1 800 delegates gives you party unity when we walk out of the stadium
3689970 hillary delegates feel like were not welcome needed or valued
3689971 what we want to have happen is for sen obama to be nominated by a unified convention of democrats
3689972 and as i have said the best way i think and i could be wrong but the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like they have a role and that their legitimacy has been validated
3689973 and thats what we want people to feel we do not want any democrat either in the hall or in the stadium or at home walking away saying well you know im just not satisfied im not happy because i mean thats what im trying to avoid

3689976 this is going to be one of those situations where people are saying i dont like that but i do like this
3689977 if speaker pelosi is truly sincere about having a vote on deep ocean oil and gas drilling to help bring down fuel costs she should use her power as speaker to call congress back into session immediately and schedule a vote on the american energy act
3689978 we are asking that she bring our american energy act up for a vote
3689979 if she brings it up under regular order then amendments will be allowed and well have that debated what we want is a chance to have that debate and have a vote
3689980 it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax on them
3689981 lack of support for mental illness is part of a total lifelong family denial of what
