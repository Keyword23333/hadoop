8460001 i took a risk that the legislature would be farther along
8460002 i was a couple of years too early the lack of law doomed my risky endeavor
8460003 this case the way its going would seem to establish that transgender people are protected
8460004 its a matter of time here in connecticut because were a progressive state
8460005 particularly in connecticut are continuing to make themselves aware of the issues
8460006 this has not been a particularly active area of the law
8460007 given that transgender people represent a significant minority in the population im not sure well see a huge influx of cases particularly in the short term
8460008 just provides transgender people a level of comfort to be who they are as a business youll have better employees if they feel safe

8460013 but its basically just a pouch its not connected to a uterus there is no uterus but what they have internally is testes that you would typically find in a male
8460014 if you told them that they had a y chromosome or a testicle inside them but they were externally female they would completely meltdown
8460015 it is of no benefit to disclose that the gonads were testes instead of ovaries
8460016 i dont have ovaries which i have to have in order to have a child
8460017 and i dont have a uterus and i dont have fallopian tubes but really i look like any other girl

8460025 aunque al principio creimos que se trataba de un fallo de nuestro equipo tras unos ajustes comprendimos que el sonido provenia del interior de la tierra y verdaderamente no podiamos creer lo que oiamos se trataba de voces humanas gritando de dolor a veces el sonido de una era bien discernible aunque se podian escuchar mientras miles en segundo plano chillando con gran sufrimiento tras este desagradable descubrimiento alrededor de la mitad de nuestro equipo se di de baja afortunadamente sea lo que sea lo que est ahi abajo ahi se va ha quedar

8460028 a prosecutor is going to talk about this being a knowing killing that the defendant knew what he was doing the defense is going to argue that it was the heat of passion that he did it because he the defendant was so upset for being duped
8460029 this is not a classic hate crime where an individual is beaten to death because of their orientation this is a case when an individual reacted irrationally and unlawfully to learning they had been fooled
8460030 it just cant be tolerated at any level and i hope that if anything positive were to come of this we would develop a stronger relationship with the gay lesbian transgendered community so that they understand just how seriously we take crimes like this and how vigorously we will pursue justice in a situation like this

8460038 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8460039 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8460040 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8460041 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8460042 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8460134 the civil rights of none shall be abridged on account of religious belief or worship nor shall any national religion be established nor shall the full and equal rights of conscience by in any manner or on any pretext infringed
8460135 during almost fifteen centuries has the legal establishment of christianity been on trial what have been its fruits more or less in all places pride and indolence in the clergy ignorance and servility in the laity in both superstition bigotry and persecution
8460136 the religion of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every man and it is the right of every man to exercise it as these may dictate this right is in its nature an unalienable right it is the duty of every man to render to the creator such homage and such only as he believes to be acceptable to him
8460137 believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his god that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only and not opinions i contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole american people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof thus building a wall of separation between church and state
8460138 strongly guarded as is the separation between religion and government in the constitution of the united states the danger of encroachment by ecclesiastical bodies may be illustrated by precedents already furnished in their short history
8460139 church and state are separate the effects are happy and they do not at all interfere with each other but where they have been confounded together no tongue nor pen can fully describe the mischiefs that have ensued

8460162 as youd expect the first thing i did was go away and ring mr peters
8460163 its always seemed to me that somewhere someplace there must have been some kind of contribution but it wasnt clear where
8460164 mr peters of course is on the record that the first he knew of the donation to his legal expenses was july 18
8460165 all new factors obv8iously are new material to be considered
8460166 in the belief that this step would also assist the labour party in its relationship with mr peters

8460168 what else does she know and is not letting on in this sordid affair
8460169 whats not smart is having underperforming schools year after year decade after decade not even measuring it not even recognising its happening and not even doing anything about it
8460170 theres no way a parent today can compare like schools with like schools
8460171 theres nothing available to the national government today that enables us to see across the nation on a comparable system which schools are falling behind and need extra resources
8460172 we want transparency and we are prepared to bring new and extra resources to the table to make a difference to disadvantaged schools and to make a difference on teacher quality
8460173 theres no point in the world with comparing a rich school on sydneys north shore with elizabeth north in south australia and how the school is going there
8460174 our whole plan is to analyse student population and compare like schools with like schools
8460175 what you should measure is if youve got like student populations
8460176 you can take that best practice to the school thats falling behind
8460177 were not only going to take the best practice there were going to take extra resources there
8460178 the argument for mls sides has always been that if the concacaf champions cup wasnt during the mls preseason then mls teams would fare better now the concacaf champions league is during the mls mid season and theyve actually managed to perform worse

8460181 there are files from all kinds of sources that we want to store and manage files are created by our digital cameras e mail cell phones portable media players camcorders pdas and laptops increasingly computer users are using different folders drives and even different computers such as a laptop and a desktop to store manage retrieve and view files yet managing hundreds or thousands of files is still largely a manual operation in some cases it is necessary to regularly get copies of files from another location to add to primary location in other cases there is a need to keep two storage locations exactly in sync some users manage files manually dragging and dropping from one place to another and keeping track of whether the locations are synchronized in their heads other users may use two or more applications to provide this functionality now there is an easier way synctoy a free powertoy for microsoft windows is an easy to use highly customizable program that helps users to do the heavy lifting involved with the copying moving and synchronization of different directories most common operations can be performed with just a few clicks of the mouse and additional customization is available without additional complexity synctoy can manage multiple sets of folders at the same time it can combine files from two folders in one case and mimic renames and deletes in another case unlike other applications synctoy actually keeps track of renames to file s and will make sure those changes get carried over to the synchronized folder

8460192 the us navy destroyer uss mcfaul which is currently docked in the georgian port of batumi carries about 50 tomahawk cruise missiles on board they are outfitted with nuclear warheads and are meant to hit ground targets the remaining nato ships are currently concentrated in the northern part of the black sea
8460193 it is strange that such a large group of nato warships has arrived for a joint exercise with bulgaria or romania usually only one or two warships participate in such exercises so the attempts to substantiate the presence of the naval group with a military exercise does not withstand any criticism
8460194 it is clear that all statements made by the political and defense administration of nato members are accompanied with outspoken militarist demarches the use of nuclear weapons by nato ships in the black sea is out of the question the conventional weapons which the nato naval group has in the region are more than enough to achieve any defense goals which can be exemplified with yugoslavia
8460195 we only want to help the people who find themselves in trouble today as for saakashvili and his regime we do not like it indeed it is obvious that he did not only make a mistake but committed a crime he must account for this crime to the people of georgia and to the international community
8460196 the absence of control over the cargoes which nato warships deliver to georgia cannot but raise concerns with us when theres no control theres no guarantee that various weapons for example man portable missile systems have not been or will not be delivered to georgia it can also be reconnaissance equipment including unmanned aerial vehicles
8460197 we have the main attack force of natos navy in the black sea which acts under the guise of delivering humanitarian cargo or holding military exercises
8460198 it is quite possible that russia has already won the support of some countries but it is not some countries that determine world politics it is not an honor for russia to be on the list with such subjects either

8460238 men are more inclined than women to exhibit a range of risk taking behaviours while on the road
8460239 men are more inclined to speed show aggression fall asleep behind the wheel and to identify themselves as impatient
8460240 insurance premiums usually take gender into account for these very reasons
8460241 men are more likely to be involved in an accident due to overconfident or risky driving and women are more likely to have had difficulty judging distances but are generally more courteous on the road
8460242 analysis of historical claims data from aa insurance found that on average women made around 6 per cent more claims than men but their average cost of their claims was lower than men
8460243 there are three kinds of lies lies damned lies and statistics
8460244 a relatively high 15 per cent of men admitted they exceeded the speed limit most of the time even if only by a few kilometres per hour compared with only 9 per cent of women
8460245 therefore women have more accidents women are worse drivers than men
8460246 well if his hat is attached to that beam and hes hanging on it shoot man it should hold this tiny plastic tab on
8460247 indeed it is a long way from the razzmatazz of americas mls but here it was that eddie johnson was handed his debut for cardiff city

8460254 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8460255 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8460256 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it will not work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8460257 weve had two powerful women speak back to back on each night michelle obama and hillary clinton
8460258 hes going to lay out a case for change hes going to set the stakes of this election the risks of continuing down the road were on which is plainly what sen mccain is offering

8460263 the sight of russian tanks in a neighboring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of
8460264 military ships are hardly a common way to deliver such aid
8460265 when it was shown to him he was very very pleased indeed
8460266 he could only widen his eyes or something like that but it was explained to him and he was thrilled
8460267 it probably did as much as the injections they were giving him
8460268 doctors dont usually make predictions but they are predicting that within three days they will be able to feed him solids and that should build up his strength
8460269 we are going to celebrate the public life of peter costello its going to be a great night
8460270 i understand its to thank peter for the work that he has done as a great treasurer for this country and as probably one of the greatest parliamentary performers that we have seen in government
8460271 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8460272 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8460273 barack obama is ready to honour the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution
8460274 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8460275 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8460276 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8460277 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8460278 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children

8460291 lots of kids may talk about it but talking about cosmetic surgery is a long way from actually going and having it done yourself
8460292 it is the bullies who have the problems not the victims they should not have to change their appearance to stop bullying
8460293 a child does not need invasive surgery to tackle bullying
8460294 if this happened in the workplace there would be laws against them schools need to take it far more seriously
8460295 we completely understand that people feel so severely bullied and destitute that they are unable to deal with what has happened to them
8460296 during the consultation process around removing unprofitable payphones a number of suggestions have been voiced by local people and local government
8460297 we have listened to these suggestions and can now confirm that local authorities that wish to maintain red telephone boxes minus the telephone equipment for aesthetic or heritage reasons will able to do so
8460298 in addition local authorities that have requested to contribute to maintenance costs to retain a red telephone box with a working telephone will also be accommodated

8460304 he can reach back and get a couple extra miles an hour on it curveball and changeup is good as well it makes him really unhittable sometimes
8460305 this is peter garretts moment of truth as the minister for the environment
8460306 we know that coal is the problem if australia keeps putting millions of tonnes and theres four billion tonnes of coal in that basin if we keep putting that into the world market we are driving climate change
8460307 it is the clearest cut case you could ever wish to see not just on greenhouse but on all of the triggers under the epbc under world heritage under ramsar convention of wetlands under threatened species you look at any of it it undermines all of it

8460328 but its coming and a lot of people are showing a lot of respect to the football program but if you want respect its earned and we have to go out and get wins if we want to keep that going we understand that
8460329 what we do at times is we try to revert back to 0 12 and 1 11 habits and thats not acceptable
8460330 thats what were here to make them understand to practice with the same intensity the same execution that never wavers it never wavers and we lose focus and we go back into that mode on occasion our job as coaches is to immediately correct that
8460331 weve been doing the same stuff since spring ball so its really about repetition and knowledge for us right now
8460332 and the offense theyve done the same stuff you always add new stuff each week to the game plan but as far as everything plays off each thing weve learned in the past so as far as scheme goes were doing a lot of the same stuff that weve done in the spring
8460333 are you kidding talk about being for it before youre against it
8460334 to those who still believe in the myth of a maverick instead of the reality of a politician i say lets compare senator mccain to candidate mccain
8460335 let me tell you before he ever debates barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself
8460336 the odds are pretty high we wont get to 60 but its not out of the question
8460337 the chatter about whether democrats can pick up enough seats in november to hit the magic number of 60 and a filibuster proof majority is getting louder
8460338 its not as good as 60 but its close enough to get a lot done
8460339 for his first presidential decision with his selection of a running mate he hit it out of the park
8460340 you guys have no idea whats going on on the other side of the planet right now

8460343 you can learn a lot about man campaigning with him
8460344 barack obama will bring down health care costs by 2 500 for the typical family and at long last deliver affordable accessible health care for all americans
8460345 took us from record surpluses to an exploding national debt from over 22 million new jobs an increase in working family incomes of 7 500 to a decline of more than 2 000 from almost 8 million americans moving out of poverty to more than 5 and half million falling into poverty and million more losing their health insurance
8460346 because barack made that choice 150 000 more children and parents have health care in illinois he fought to make that happen
8460347 john mccain has served his country with honor but his refusal to change course even in the face of the failed policies of bush cheney is reckless and will not keep us safe
8460348 sen mccain says that american troops should remain in iraq perhaps as long as they have been stationed in korea and japan as if there were no difference in history religion or culture between our friends in asia and those in the middle east
8460349 weve been in south korea weve been in japan for 60 years weve been in south korea for 50 years or so thatd be fine with me as long as americans as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed then its fine with me i hope it would be fine with you if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where al qaida is training recruiting and equipping and motivating people every single day
8460350 in the last two years sen obama helped pass the new gi education bill
8460351 sen mccain and the republicans have centered their answer to our vital energy needs on one solution offshore drilling sen mccain calls for it in every speech white house analysts congressional analysts and the oil industry all agree that offshore drilling wont add one drop to our energy pool for at least 10 years will it do any harm the answer is we just dont know and neither does he
8460352 i didnt hear cunningham give any kind of order i didnt see him there
8460353 i thought oh no as i put two and two together
8460354 again that cause it but then it still happended at the 2nd day which was yesterday

8460364 i understand its to thank peter for the work that he has done as a great treasurer for this country and as probably one of the greatest parliamentary performers that we have seen in government
8460365 we are now in opposition and i think its appropriate that the victorian division of the liberal party thank peter costello for the work he did in government
8460366 when it was shown to him he was very very pleased indeed
8460367 he could only widen his eyes or something like that but it was explained to him and he was thrilled

8460413 our healthy cash flows and strong balance sheet position us well to continue to expand especially our theme park operations which together with our exhibition and distribution businesses remain in high demand even in these challenging times
8460414 it is testament to the strength of our gold coast theme parks that the 2008 ebitda result of 80 2 million was only marginally behind the record 84 1 million set in 2007 this result was achieved despite the extremely wet and monsoonal weather conditions as reported in our december half year and which continued on into this half vrl continues to focus on expansion in the theme park and leisure arena and has purchased aquarium and theme park operations in sydney noosa new zealand hawaii and phoenix i would also like to take this opportunity to thank mr bill conn for his 16 years as a non executive director of vrl bill announced his retirement in april and his knowledge and counsel will be greatly missed
8460415 our portfolio of businesses continues to produce strong cash flow and earnings growing and driving ebitda in all our businesses is a major focus for village executive directors and senior executives the new additions to our theme parks portfolio are being integrated into the greater village roadshow group with energised marketing expertise and cost synergies starting to take effect

8460426 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8460427 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8460428 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer
8460429 these changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation marked inflammation and increased apoptosis
8460430 because both berries and the second agent maintain near normal levels of expression of these 53 genes we believe their early deregulation may be particularly important in the development of esophageal cancer
8460431 whats emerging from studies in cancer chemoprevention is that using single compounds alone is not enough
8460432 and berries are not enough we never get 100 percent tumor inhibition with berries so we need to think about another food that we can add to them that will boost the chemopreventive activities of berries alone

8460514 including the surf fleet there are more than 150 vessels on order in the multi purpose category
8460515 the subsea industry is increasingly reliant upon deepwater and ultra deepwater subsea developments while much of these are today being developed by the major international oil companies an increasing number of these fields will be controlled by a few key national oil companies nocs they are likely to have a different agenda one in which a high oil price does not stimulate development instead political rather than pure commercial drivers will come into play the rate of field development will come down to a countrys requirements not a companys as it is today
8460516 on top of the other factors to consider manning will remain an issue where will the crew come from to man these new vessels what solutions are industry and academia putting in place to tackle this issue
8460517 all of this is worrying as increasing costs and a shortage of drilling rigs in deepwater are pushing up exploration costs
8460518 does this imply that the rate of growth of the subsea sector is about to decline dramatically just as significant new tonnage hits the marketplace possibly
8460519 the new build surf vessels have increased capacity which will further expand the overall capacity of the market and thereby compounding the potential oversupply problem
8460520 it is unlikely that many old vessels will be retired it is likely though that they will exert commercial and capacity pressure further down the market as they start to look for work
8460521 its not all doom and gloom we have a fantastic subsea industry in the uk were the world leader but we must prepare for all potential problems to ensure we remain in front there is no point in looking back in three years time and saying we should have done something in 2008
8460522 we must hope the need for deepwater production and enhancing recovery from the more mature offshore provinces continues to drive the subsea business worldwide we certainly dont want to see new vessels tied up waiting for better market conditions or a crew to arrive
8460523 across a number of sectors from the subsea industry to stakeholders and financial institutions we must work together to ensure one of the most successful british industries in recent times goes from strength to strength

8460547 this report reveals that many governments are demonstrating the will to change childrens lives but it also makes clear that there is much more still to do to protect children around the world from exploitive child labor
8460548 while the report showed a decline in the incidence of child labor around the world there are still millions of undocumented children working under hazardous and exploitive conditions
8460549 many of these children are forced to endure horrendous hardships because their survival depends on it and their families rely on their income

8460571 barack obama will bring down health care costs by 2 500 for the typical family and at long last deliver affordable accessible health care for all americans
8460572 took us from record surpluses to an exploding national debt from over 22 million new jobs an increase in working family incomes of 7 500 to a decline of more than 2 000 from almost 8 million americans moving out of poverty to more than 5 and half million falling into poverty and million more losing their health insurance
8460573 because barack made that choice 150 000 more children and parents have health care in illinois he fought to make that happen
8460574 john mccain has served his country with honor but his refusal to change course even in the face of the failed policies of bush cheney is reckless and will not keep us safe
8460575 sen mccain says that american troops should remain in iraq perhaps as long as they have been stationed in korea and japan as if there were no difference in history religion or culture between our friends in asia and those in the middle east
8460576 weve been in south korea weve been in japan for 60 years weve been in south korea for 50 years or so thatd be fine with me as long as americans as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed then its fine with me i hope it would be fine with you if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where al qaida is training recruiting and equipping and motivating people every single day

8460581 a very good second half performance led to a full year result up substantially on the prior year this result highlights the strength of our integrated business which provides a strong platform for growth
8460582 we expect this growth to continue in the current financial year with a number of projects expected to make initial or significantly increased contributions to origins financial performance based on current market conditions we are targeting growth in underlying eps of at least 10 for the 2008 09 financial year
8460583 the directors are pleased to announce a final dividend of 13 cents per share fully franked to be paid on 3 october 2008 to shareholders of record on 9 september 2008 this will bring total dividends for the financial year ended 30 june 2008 to 25 cents per share an increase of 19 compared with last year this represents a dividend payout ratio of nearly 50 of underlying eps
8460584 origins financial performance and business development activities this year have continued to strengthen and develop the companys fuel integrated generation and retail business
8460585 record production sales and revenues have resulted in higher earnings from the exploration and production segment this reflected our growing coal seam gas operations a full year contribution from the bassgas project and an initial contribution from the otway gas project
8460586 the retail segment significantly increased earnings predominantly due to a full year contribution from sun retail despite continuing high churn in gas and electricity markets and tighter margins in the lpg business
8460587 earnings in the generation business were in line with the prior year after adjusting for the mt stuart power station transition to an internal contract
8460588 we have significantly increased our capital expenditure with major projects such as the kupe gas project csg assets in queensland and the darling downs power station representing a substantial investment in origins continuing growth
8460589 a number of projects are expected to make initial or significantly increased contributions to origins financial performance in the current financial year
8460590 during the year it is expected that a number of developments that could create substantial opportunities for origin will either be resolved or progressed
8460591 in addition the company will continue to progress the development of several major projects which are expected to make contributions following the current financial year these include the kupe gas project in new zealand targeted to commence gas production in mid 2009 ongoing growth in csg production and continuing investments in generation such as the darling downs and mortlake power stations the cullerin range wind farm and expansion of the mt stuart power station

8460602 there are areas where we have common interest with russia and we want to work with them the question is whether russia has an ability to work with us

8460701 theyre doing this to use less oil and sell it for a 120 abarrel we can switch our cars to natural gas and stop sending ourdollars to foreign countries
8460702 get thisone iran is changing its cars to run on natural gas and were notdoing a thing here
8460703 theyre doing this to use less oil and sell it for a 120 abarrel we can switch our cars to natural gas and stop sending ourdollars to foreign countries
8460704 its peaceful its a beautiful neighborhood here with nice lakes and a lot of wildlife
8460705 when you train for a marathon you need to run with somebody who is mentally tough
8460706 its very beneficial to run with people who know what it takes and have the stamina to do it
8460707 and its like a huge stress reliever for us if something is bothering you by the time youre done running you no longer care if its bothering you anymore
8460708 the beautiful thing about it is you can take your mind wherever you want to go
8460709 growing up in competitive sports its just part of who i was
8460710 i kind of lost that for a while after having three kids and being involved in their lives for so many years so it was nice to finally get myself back to where i can feel like i can still have a competitive edge and have that part of myself back
8460711 its just a part of who i am and i didnt realize that until i didnt have that and then got it back
8460712 i knew i had to get back to running because i know how it feels to feel good and healthy
8460713 we wanted to make this club kind of a community thing
8460714 i knew that was the only way i was going to be able to stay at it and be able to reach my goal when youre running and you dont have somebody to push you youre going to say well maybe tomorrow and not do it
8460715 its accountability because its hard to get up at five in the morning and go for a run
8460716 its a process that starts with excitement then you go through the states of getting worried then tired then upset then in pain
8460717 the marathon is an experience that by the time you reach mile 18 or 20 your body is starting to crumble so you need to get strength from your inner side from your mind thats when you need to become a mentally tough person if you dont have that then you wont finish
8460718 but of course when you finish its a great joy the fact of finishing a marathon and knowing you did it is a great sense of accomplishment
8460719 its a personal fulfillment of achieving something and i think thats what drives anybody
8460720 for matt and myself itd be nice knowing what the situation would be and be able to move forward with it the way i look at it more than anything the sooner it can happen the sooner we can get past the interviews and media coverage that goes with it and you can prepare for the game
8460721 we know its getting close and you get that anxiety and excitement knowing the decision has to be made soon i am sure coach understands that and hell make the decision as soon as its necessary
8460722 hopefully well get in enough snaps with the first offensive line that both can play
8460723 i just wanted to make sure kurt gets his timing with the ones for this game much like we did in kansas city
8460724 you go in and lead and manage and thats part of the deal handing the ball off and getting your guys to play
8460725 but when it comes to the preseason i want to get comfortable in the pass game because thats what they are going to need me for anybody can hand it off
8460726 i dont think it will take long but there is always something a little different about playing games thats what i am trying to get out of this week
8460727 if fans had been at training camp they saw us rotate quarterbacks in practice its the same thing
8460728 there is a disparity of snaps between matt and kurt i had a suspicion of that but i did check it out kurt has not had a lot of snaps with the first line and the first receivers in a game situation thats what we are trying to accommodate with this
8460729 when executive teams change executives drive corporate giving so priorities may change
8460730 there may be a period where were not clear what programs they
8460731 we have every reason to believe inbev is going to be a good corporate citizen
8460732 the challenge with an event like this is how much money do i really want to give away
8460733 i found it difficult to go to sleep last night
8460734 it makes you wonder like if were going to be still protected
8460735 im scared because of the last time what happened and really nervous
8460736 the fact of another hurricane after all the devastation it really just makes you think a little bit
8460737 i got a first feel for that last night with my little girl whos ten and her biggest concern was for our pets and didnt want to go through the whole leaving the pets behind
8460738 its kind of like counseling i get out my feelings and just makes me feel better
8460739 we want to be patient if they have these changes in their behaviors of actions thats a normal response its transient and although we are in a difficult spot in time we want to try and have those kids express that stuff and then have time to go back to normal without us getting angry
8460740 while lining the pockets of executives is tearing a once proud airline apart
8460741 disappointing that the twu has taken this approach to the current contract negotiations
8460742 these are indeed difficult days for airlines yet americans employees are among the best compensated in the industry
8460743 forging an agreement that meets their needs and keeps american competitive is in the long term best interests of american and all of its employees
8460744 shift from full time cfia meat inspection presence to an oversight role allowing industry to implement food safety control programs and to manage key risks
8460745 the announcement of these reallocations has been deferred owing to significant communications risks and to allow for further policy and communications work to be completed
8460746 their unfounded accusations and fear mongering will threaten the well placed confidence canadians have in the safety of canadian products and it will also have negative consequences on exports from our agri business if their lies and rumours are believed
8460747 it was a discussion document as you know certain portions of that were brought forward in the budget and put in to play but the vast majority was up for discussion and has not been implemented
8460748 theyll have a more oversight role within the plant itself i think its a much more pro active role
8460749 its necessary to reform and revamp our food and product inspection regime after some years of neglect
8460750 all i can say is that with the new system that has been set up theres always an adjustment phase

8460794 back in my early days everything consisted of what i like to call tuxedo magicians where everyone wore a tuxedo and a nice button up shirt with a vest everybody looked the same
8460795 so when criss angel came out it showed everybody that not all magicians are the same there are different styles different qualities to magicians
8460796 dealing with a deck of cards and looking at peoples faces when i could find their card blindfolded made me enjoy what i do
8460797 i have an illusion right now that im setting up that involves the band journey and their song faithfully its a whole romance piece

8460800 i tried leaving magic for about a year or so when i was 16

8460802 hes one of our main guys but we dont think its a season ending injury
8460803 the time frame it fluctuates but hopefully with his youth
8460804 with the off season moves we made hopefully we can still play at a high level this year to me its more something that you look at as a challenge and you dont let it defeat you you deal with it

8461121 all thanks are due to allah who sent the book quran down to his slave and made it a source of clear guidance regarding everything and a reminder for people of correct understanding and ordered us to abide by it since it is his rope that is the firmest of all handle holds he guided us by it to the paths of guidance and the methods of correctness and stated in it that it is he who made the sun a shining thing and the moon as a light and measured out for it stages that you might know the number of years and the reckoning 10 5
8461122 which the scholars said is a general ruling for the entire ummah then no muslim has said this so far
8461123 note that he salla llahu alaihi wa sallam did not say we cannot read a book or memorize especially since many companions knew how to read write count and memorize rather he said we do not write or count i e our religion does not need to be recorded and calculated for as is the case with the people of the scripture who know the timings of their fast and breaking the fast and other religious activities by using records and calculations thus their religion is tied to books which if they disappear they would not know their religion this is why most of the people of sunnah memorize the quran and hadeeth more so than those among the people of bid ah who do so people of bid ah are similar to the people of the scripture in some ways the two sahihs stated that the prophet salla llahu alaihi wa sallam said you will follow the wrong ways of your predecessors so completely and literally just as the two feathers of an arrow are perfectly aligned that if they should go into the hole of a mastigure you too will go there they said o allahs prophet do you mean the jews and the christians

8461194 that day on the street that wasnt the first time i met you
8461195 when you defeated the daleks you became part time lord we think thats why he took your memories your body couldnt handle it over the past few months weve been looking for something that would be able to alter your mind physically so that it can withstand the strain
8461196 all you have to do is press it against your temple and it will do the rest
8461197 i wont be me anymore will i is that it are you trying to erase me replace me with someone else whoever it was that saved the world
8461198 donna it was you youre the one who did it
8461199 no we werent we didnt have the time but that doesnt mean i love you any less now
8461200 tu s mau tu n o prestas n o te quero para mim n o te quero ver mais e vai te embora
8461201 ive felt the injury on and off for 16 months sometimes more sometimes less its something ive had to cope with
8461202 the staff and i have worked very hard so that im fit and when i play i dont miss out
8461203 theyve done a really good job i think weve got it under control
8461204 hopefully ill be back soon and fit for the remainder of the season im improving every day
8461205 i want to win i remember the last time we went there i only played half a team because we had a monday league game against newcastle
8461206 when i saw lazio celebrating at the end it was like they had won the
8461207 well view the super cup as a one off and we want to win it but we are expecting a very tough game
8461208 no hay arte m s dif cil que el arte de escribir sin arte
8461209 i don t feel like it i just want you to hold me
8461210 but you don t even play tennis but ok if you like it then lets get it
8461211 i am ready to go lets go to the cash register
8461212 no no no honey were not going to buy all this stuff
8461213 no honey i just want you to hold this stuff for a while
8461214 im not sitting here thinking were no 1 weve got to keep our ranking
8461215 weve got to get better weve got to start out play the best we can play and find out where our weaknesses are weve already got some that we know about weve just got to keep getting better and better and better and hope that were good enough to stay in the race
8461216 right now i just want to beat georgia southern thats all im really thinking about after that well move onto central michigan
8461217 after that well move to conference play and think about how meaningful that first conference game is going to be towards our opportunity to try and win the east
8461218 the national championship is really and truly out of our hands even if we win every game theres no guarantee
8461219 we might win the first two games and be fourth in the country that could happen easily you know and im not worried about any style points i just want to win im just trying to win
8461220 neland probably wont make it for this game as we dont think hell be quite healthy enough but were hoping monday hell be able to go
8461221 whether hell play next week i wont predict that but im sure well try to work him in as long as nothing else happens
8461222 im working with the same guys with the exception of coach john lilly
8461223 as a staff weve changed the system a little bit last year and we were together for a whole year and through spring practice were more comfortable in what were trying to do and working out the finer coaching points on each particular play i think thats been the easier adjustment
8461224 you try to get your players in the best position where they will be successful but theyve still got to go out and do it on saturday
8461225 it keeps you on your toes knowing theres somebody else who could start but its good for both of us
8461226 both of us are starting if were going with the nickel so basically it adds up the same amount of plays anyway
8461227 if we were home id have the stadium announcer introduce both of them as starters
8461228 were going into the game thinking two guys over one guy
8461229 hatcher sat us both down and said to be ready
8461230 tomorrow youre going to see obama come down from olympus to be among us mere mortals
8461231 as a quarterback you cant worry about everything else thats going on around you
8461232 all you need to do is go out and play for your teammates and show its a whole different guy out there and i want to go out and win ballgames with you i can praise him a whole lot ill say hes a man hes brave definitely
8461233 were going to keep playing let the game come to us
8461234 if it happens it happens if it doesnt were not going to go to try to force it we want to stay in our game plan
8461235 the more you play the more opportunities there are for big plays
8461236 he just hasnt had the reps i think people would have liked to see this offseason
8461237 we knew we had to play well and we did
8461238 we played the kind of football were expected and used to playing we didnt turn the ball over we made good decisions we limited our mental mistakes and converted third downs thats the kind of football we want to play when the regular season hits well polish things up this week and get ready for minnesota
8461239 i think its good preparation for the season coming up its going to be good for me a learning experience to go against the first team defense see what it feels like just see how far along i am
8461240 and really preseason to me is about finding out as much information as you possibly can not only about your team but about the individuals this will give us a great look at a lot of guys that are fighting for jobs
8461241 good food cheap friendly quick what more can you ask for

8461244 was part of the weather underground in the 1970s they bombed the pentagon the capitol and other buildings hes never apologized for that
8461245 the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when i was eight years old somehow reflects on me and my values doesnt make much sense george
8461246 i was a child of privilege and i woke up to a world on fire
8461247 uh uh well but alan that wasnt all uh we but we did a lot for aids in africa

8461251 there is no reason why rice sardines bread instant noodles and other items would go up in prices because the cost of inputs for these have gone down the dti must ensure that our people are not taken advantage of and that prices remain reasonable and explainable to the public
8461252 world supply of rice has gone up and prices have gone down we should see a continued decrease in the cost of local rice i continue to urge the government to carry out a fertilizer support program and a rehabilitation of our irrigation systems to ensure long term supply for our country

8461254 we are going to hope for the best but were preparing for the worst
8461255 everybody should be looking at their plans just like were looking at our plans and get ready
8461256 if they dont have a plan you still have time if you wait until the storms on top of you thats when panics going to set in and you dont think wisely
8461257 although we have made strides in rebuilding our infrastructure the levees have not been fully repaired and we have an 800 million budget gap to complete our sewage and water systems
8461258 the citizens should not be worried about the flooding again
8461259 we definitely dont want to wait until saturday or sunday to decide what to do
8461260 i have faith in the parts of the levees that were rebuilt
8461261 as long as theres a chance that well be in this storms path ill be here in louisiana
8461262 im going to make sure im here personally to help lead the preparation efforts and if necessary any recovery efforts that are necessary after the fact

8461361 by and large we are getting a slightly higher level of wine quality than we have in previous years
8461362 i have been very very impressed with both the whites and the reds

8461367 gerrard will have an operation tomorrow on a groin problem we knew this would happen he had a problem and now he will have an operation and he will be out for 10 or 15 days its not a big problem but he had pain and it was difficult
8461368 the injury wasnt affected by the period of extra time when he went away with
8461369 he was playing with pain before and he kept going today because he knew he was going to see the surgeon tomorrow its not serious its a minor operation but we needed to do it
8461370 we knew it would be difficult because they played well in the first game and we had to work really hard until the end for me the most positive thing is we played a little bit better against a good team who are sharp now we scored right at the end that showed the team was working really hard

8461399 there are files from all kinds of sources that we want to store and manage files are created by our digital cameras e mail cell phones portable media players camcorders pdas and laptops increasingly computer users are using different folders drives and even different computers such as a laptop and a desktop to store manage retrieve and view files yet managing hundreds or thousands of files is still largely a manual operation in some cases it is necessary to regularly get copies of files from another location to add to primary location in other cases there is a need to keep two storage locations exactly in sync some users manage files manually dragging and dropping from one place to another and keeping track of whether the locations are synchronized in their heads other users may use two or more applications to provide this functionality now there is an easier way synctoy a free powertoy for microsoft windows is an easy to use highly customizable program that helps users to do the heavy lifting involved with the copying moving and synchronization of different directories most common operations can be performed with just a few clicks of the mouse and additional customization is available without additional complexity synctoy can manage multiple sets of folders at the same time it can combine files from two folders in one case and mimic renames and deletes in another case unlike other applications synctoy actually keeps track of renames to file s and will make sure those changes get carried over to the synchronized folder

8461406 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
8461407 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
8461408 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
8461409 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
8461410 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
8461411 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
8461412 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
8461413 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
8461414 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
8461415 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
8461416 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
8461417 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
8461418 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
8461419 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
8461420 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
8461421 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
8461422 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
8461423 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
8461424 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
8461425 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
8461426 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
8461427 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
8461428 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
8461429 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
8461430 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
8461431 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
8461432 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
8461433 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
8461434 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
8461435 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
8461436 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
8461437 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
8461438 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
8461439 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

8461444 in the town im from everyone is very critical of each other the neighbors all gossip about everyone and its a real negative place to live im sure glad to be leaving it is not a very cheerful place
8461445 what about the town you are from how is it
8461446 well in the town im from everyone is very close and always willing to lend their neighbor a helping hand theres always a hello and thank you everywhere you go i really hate to leave i feel almost like we are leaving family
8461447 grandpa how come when the first man came into our town you told him it was a terrible place to live and when the family came in to town you told them it was a wonderful place to live
8461448 no matter where you move you take your own attitude with you and thats what makes it terrible or wonderful

8461460 when we have people who have problems with what i consider essential services like water sanitary sewer and storm water we need to get our arms around those kinds of things

8461462 i want to emphasize that this is not a situation where we deploy 60 or 90 days and you dont see us again were here indefinitely
8461463 those who are thinking this ends today i assure you it will not end today
8461464 its getting better its a process though it aint gonna happen overnight its just like you walk ten miles into a dark forest you gotta walk ten miles back out thats the way it is
8461465 i would not be surprised if as a result of all of these investigations that are ongoing and as this investigation continues that if we dont tie some of this drug activity and gang activity to some of the violence that has occurred

8461480 on numerous occasions ive represented independent directors and audit committees
8461481 i dont believe this is only a trend which is triggered by a crisis but instead reflects the complexity and demands being placed on directors today and the recognition of the fact that board members need additional advice in order to fulfill their very demanding fiduciary obligations
8461482 when directors reach out and say they want independent counsel to assist them its from their desire to do the best job possible
8461483 the case for independent counsel board members increasingly recognize the wisdom of seeking separate legal advice
8461484 since passage of the sarbanes oxley act two clear trends have emerged in corporate governance
8461485 first most directors and ceos have come to recognize the value of an independent board the second trend directors operating in an increasingly regulated and litigious environment are seeking legal advice more frequently as a regular feature of board diligence
8461486 most directors now recognize the significant intersection of those two trends since your company benefits from having independent directors and sound legal advice you should ensure that directors are getting independent legal advice
8461487 looking at it through the eyes of the general counsel i have found that the stronger the general counsel is the more they view this as an opportunity and not a problem
8461488 general counsel have a very difficult and time consuming job they recognize a board may have a different point of view than management this is a very thoughtful way for a general counsel to work with somebody who is looking at it through a different lens

8461497 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8461498 i move that senator barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states
8461499 it is with great pride that i announce barack obama is the democratic nominee for president of the united states by acclamation
8461500 i have been asked to inform you that senator obama accepts the nomination

8461503 he will talk about how barack obama has what it takes to be a strong commander in chief
8461504 it was really tough i am completely out of breath
8461505 i was pushed to the limit the last time i played her she was up 5 1 in third and i had to come back
8461506 i was concerned i was going to get my dress dirty
8461507 the most important thing is to stay positive in the difficult moments in the match and be able to win even when you feel tired
8461508 when i got into a dangerous situation so i started moving her around a little bit more in the second set i was able to gain more confidence
8461509 hopefully i can play even better in the next round
8461510 after it happened i was thinking more of it than i was the pain so it is not really a big deal
8461511 but in a certain moment i felt big pain so i had to get it taped
8461512 overall we had a good balance with him in the side
8461513 he could have stayed on he was disappointed twente didnt have a go because he always wants to test himself
8461514 i took him off because he has only just come back from the hamstring injury
8461515 we want to play with the best and that means qualifying for the group stage
8461516 i felt we were well organised disciplined and focused we were never really under threat
8461517 i felt the whole team was sharp physically we were much better than saturday
8461518 we have been struggling for goals but i was never really worried it is difficult when you start the season with a champions league qualifier and an international
8461519 i was here on tuesday and they were talking about a crisis at arsenal
8461520 someone said it was the best time to play them after they lost to fulham but it was the worst time
8461521 fabregas is a big player he makes arsenal tick once you see him on the teamsheet its going to be hard
8461522 we played with belief and competed with them in the first leg

8461628 the child that clung to my leg was now wanting to muck the stalls and walk the ponies it was giving him this i can attitude
8461629 very often a child with special needs doesnt have a best friend
8461630 the phones not ringing off the hook when they get home
8461631 they are very intuitive and patient they have to be able to get into elevators or between a hospital bed and a machine things that normally would spook a horse
8461632 it takes a great deal of exposure and experience but their ability is also innate

8461649 queensland government officials will meet their federal counterparts next week to work through the complexities of the relevant state and federal legislation
8461650 a very good day for queensland police and our cmc its a very bad day for criminals and particularly for drug traffickers
8461651 i think most queenslanders are going to be very very happy that the rudd government is supporting the bligh government to allow our police to have these powers to enable them to get on with their jobs
8461652 its an important tool but its just yet another tool and its important i guess that not too much emphasis be placed on it

8461663 hes done everything for this organization they told joe take as much time as he needs there will always be a place here for you no pressure
8461664 for sure i was worrying and a bunch of us were worrying about what was going to happen because we know were a much better team when hes in the lineup now that he made the right decision everybodys pumped we know how much better we are when joes in
8461665 if you insist on a quick answer youre probably going to get the answer you dont want if you insist on an answer now it might be no if you give me more time it might be yes
8461666 teams asked if they could at least submit an offer for consideration and joe told me to advise teams not to bother
8461667 peter would like to play if his health will permit him right now hes working on his health issues related to his foot and theres nothing new on that

8461683 barack obama responded like a true friend of georgia and a true statesman of the 21st century so who can we trust to keep america safe

8461841 theres so much more going on here than what theyre saying that the decisions they make look capricious at a minimum
8461842 among scholars who study multiracial identity i dont think any of us believe in that hypothesis
8461843 its the most controversial take its basically the reason used to keep interracial marriages illegal until the 1960s at best we might use it as a straw man
8461844 you have this assumption that blacks are one monolithic population whites are another monolithic population and multiracials are the monolithic blending between them
8461845 you may be a little slow to acquire language but once you do you find it easier to understand syntax and pronunciation for other languages as well straddling cultures may add risks but if we can address those risks it flips over into a strength

8461918 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8461919 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers

8462195 all of us have been inspired by senator obamas candidacy
8462196 i stand here so proud of our party so proud of our country so awed by the journey our nation has taken to arrive at this moment
8462197 but our historic journey will not be over until we elect barack obama the next president of the united states
8462198 with your help i intend to become the first woman senator from new hampshire
8462199 no more tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas instead well cut taxes for middle class families and small businesses and get our economy moving
8462200 failed to offer any specific ideas on how strengthen our economy and once again refused to support any efforts to expand domestic drilling and energy exploration
8462201 allegheny county solicitor mike wojcik has determined that the petition by the group friends against counterproductive taxation which seeks to cut the countys controversial drink tax from 10 percent to 0 5 percent by referendum is legally insufficient
8462202 from 2009 10 those edf weekends will be freed up and there will be no other competing competitions
8462203 gorki aguila has not committed any specific crime as defined by the current criminal code
8462204 these kinds of trials are very biased its difficult for someone to be absolved
8462205 a lawyer can do very little because theres no evidence of criminal activity presented only what the police say
8462206 weve finished our new album we dont know if this is because of that or if it could be something thats been cooking for months
8462207 i want to win more tournaments this season and stay in the top four and maybe get closer to the no1 spot
8462208 el actual proyecto de presupuesto es deficitario en el orden de los 15 9 billones de pesos conclusi n que se obtiene al reorganizar los rubros de fuentes y usos del proyecto bajo la metodolog a ingresos gastos y fuentes de financiamiento
8462209 no queremos ver sobreestimados los ingresos por los c lculos optimistas sobre el crecimiento econ mico y las utilidades de ecopetrol que tiene el gobierno central
8462210 this morning i told the florida delegation stop running your elections like a bingo parlor everyone whos eligible gets to vote and the votes should be counted accurately
8462211 the race is tied in montana its been tied for a couple of months i told the florida delegation youre the big dog with 27 electoral votes montana only has three youre the big dog act like the big dog i want to hear you bark they were standing up barking woof woof woof
8462212 i dont know where i come up with this stuff i swear to god i dont
8462213 i have never been in my entire life able to deliver a speech from a tele prompter
8462214 after the speech i wasnt mobbed i went back down the hole the people here barely know me
8462215 i cant deliver this state nobody can do that but the voters he has to run his own campaign hes got to do it himself hes got the best ground game of anyone whos ever run for office in montana
8462216 we drive a lot of miles in montana when bush cheney got into office gas went from 1 75 per gallon to four bucks but weve been apparently helpless
8462217 british sports have benefited from record levels of government investment im sure the boa chairman when moynihan was sports minister would have certainly enjoyed the opportunities hes had
8462218 we expect the icc to decide on this critical matter of the ftp in the very near future
8462219 only then can we assess the overall impact on our business and the implications of the iccs actions
8462220 george burley will be attending the sponsor event at the urban brasserie not the urban brassiere if there are at any stage any sponsor requirements to do with brassieres then i will take care of them
8462221 quise venir para que todos sepan que estoy orgulloso de tener a joe biden y a toda la familia biden como compa eros en este camino para recuperar estados unidos
8462222 hab a afirmado anoche hillary antes de subrayar la importancia de derrotar a mccain quien debe ser proclamado candidato la pr xima semana en saint paul durante la convenci n republicana
8462223 if i have a hundred dollars on something i might drop it down to 85 or 90 just to make them feel more comfortable because the sales tax is so high
8462224 thats almost ten percent i think thats probably going to hurt business
8462225 i want to feel safe in my community is that economically feasible you bet it is
8462226 so it really is a more fair form of taxation rather than putting it all on property tax which has a major impact on those with fixed incomes
8462227 we need to say to the people of colorado springs and el paso county you have a choice this is the service we can provide at this level and at this level which choice would you like to have
8462228 its still too early to tell exactly what its going to do
8462229 if a tree comes through the roof and buries them underneath there theyre going to be on their own
8462230 the citizens should not be worried about the flooding again
8462231 where it takes place in canada or elsewhere all of these places have publics who can be intimidated whether by bringing down canadian airplanes setting off bombs in nightclubs or tube stations in london burning down schools in afghanistan so girls cant get an education
8462232 it makes no difference in law whether the public or government sought to be intimidated is in canada or is anywhere else in the world
8462233 that would have to be established by evidence and there isnt any up to this point
8462234 for him to now pretend to be surprised caught off guard or in any way prejudiced is disingenuous in the extreme
8462235 was by no means the end of the groups and mr khawajas intentions
8462236 doesnt need to know who was going to get it he just needs to build a working device and he has agreed to do it because the bros are working for the same cause of jihad that he is working for with its worldwide implications but he knows hes dealing with a group in london
8462237 what he actually did was set himself up as a quartermaster of terror providing money and medical supplies night vision goggles and outdoor gear as well as devices for use by certainly the london based jihadist terrorist group and secondly the bros fighting in pakistan and afghanistan
8462238 in momin khawajas view the world is divided into two camps the faithful and the kuffar non believers that his moving spirit is in his own words jihad against the west all out that he has vowed to become the wests mortal enemy that mortal in this sense is to be taken literally that he is in short a zealot with deadly intentions part of a widespread and transnational movement that he fell in with like minded individuals and formed part of a cell with some of them
8462239 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8462240 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8462241 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8462242 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8462243 this day is like magic it has been such a struggle
8462244 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8462245 should we trust john mccains judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from iraq that we must stay indefinitely
8462246 now after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8462247 forty five years it has taken for an african american to be able to come this far forty five years its insane
8462248 its just liberating forty five years ago there was a man who believed one day we would all be walking down the path together and now obama is making that happen
8462249 youve come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do
8462250 the campaign generated so much heat it increased global warming
8462251 a remarkable ability to inspire people to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose
8462252 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more thanks but no thanks in this case the third time is not the charm
8462253 i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8462254 i have been impressed at every critical moment where the stakes are very high that barack obama has risen to the occasion
8462255 man i hate a shy chick dont you hate a shy chick i had a plate of shy chick and she aint shy no mo she changed her name to my chick
8462256 washed up nigga who only hating because they arent selling as much
8462257 tom is one of the most instinctive and talented art directors ive worked with and pete will dig until hes found a great idea
8462258 they have both been building their management experience at some great agencies they are ambitious and hungry
8462259 which is strange given the cutting edge nature of the comedians involved
8462260 initial research suggested that comedy as a sector and particularly comedy shows and festival branding is on the whole pretty bad
8462261 there seemed to be an oddly depressing comfort zone of zany gurning chattering teeth logos everywhere we looked
8462262 we came at it from a completely different angle and commissioned and art directed a range of photographic portraits of people looking miserable or fed up
8462263 this forms the signature ironic idea behind all the marketing communications
8462264 they being the city council the main financial contributor to the event wanted an eye catching cool and clever campaign that would elevate the festival
8462265 before studentcashpoint co uk uk students would need to navigate through any number of websites to discover grant opportunities it was a complicated process and needlessly so
8462266 now with studentcashpoint co uk common sense has prevailed students can search our user friendly up to date database and discover a range of funding options in minutes we hope the website will make a real difference when it comes to the burden of student debt
8462267 iwm north is now in the process of re tendering for its preferred supplier framework for design print and creative services
8462268 we will appoint a number of agencies through this tender process to our preferred supplier list which will be in place for a three year period from september 2008
8462269 the number of agencies on the list is yet to be confirmed depending on what is presented at the pitch interviews but is not likely to be more than five
8462270 the museum has had interest from 29 agencies these have been short listed to nine who will be interviewed during september with a view to appointing to our preferred suppliers list by the end of the month
8462271 here at imperial war museum north good design has always been important to us and we work with agencies who share our ethos and who will strive to help us achieve our aims
8462272 our constant challenge is to come up with a fresh and exciting approach to our annual wine fairs
8462273 they are a vital customer touch point and represent a true interactive experience with our brand and product range
8462274 with working for blue bell mini for a number of years i feel very much part of the brand and now to be part of the company marketing campaign is very exciting
8462275 i dont think it has hit home just yet but when i see my face on billboards and in newspapers i am sure it will
8462276 our aim is to build a vibrant site that will prove popular with the hundreds of thousands of people who speak welsh and that is great news for anyone who cares about the welsh language
8462277 its my job to let people know just what the county has to offer there are so many hidden gems in the region that i guarantee no one will be disappointed if they make the decision to come and film here
8462278 thats why im now working hard to get the word out that im here and that im ready to assist with any kind of filming enquiry from location sourcing to pinning down a particular permit or finding the perfect crew member
8462279 i am really proud of all the young people who have been involved in both the dr sober and the losing it projects theyve all worked so hard and been so committed and creative

8462282 were very confident that we have the capital base now that we need to go forward in 2008
8462283 today i can say that we will not need additional funds these problems are behind us we will not return to the market
8462284 we have more capital than we need so we can say to the market that we dont need more injections we can confirm that we have tackled the problem
8462285 in 2007 we lost 8 6 billion dollars after tax but we raised 12 8 billion dollars in new capital we raised significantly more capital than we lost and we did that on purpose so that we could say to the marketplace that we raised more than enough capital we replaced all the capital we lost we have plenty of capital going forward and we dont need to come back into the equity market the goal is to maintain our current ratings no more capital raising im sure we have enough capital
8462286 we deliberately raised more capital than we lost last year we believe that will allow us to not have to go back to the equity market in the foreseeable future
8462287 john thain has been very clear that we have sufficient capital and dont have a need to raise additional common equity for the foreseeable future when we raised this capital in january we had a lot of demand so we went beyond what we needed
8462288 it has huge implications for the municipal bond market and for banks that may have to take another round of writedowns its just a mess
8462289 american express said second quarter net income came in at 653 million or 56 cents a share vs 1 06 billion or 88 cents a share the same period a year earlier the latest results include 600 million that the company added to reserves to cover bad loans in the u s the company said there was also one other 136 million charge and a tax benefit of 101 million american express was expected to make 83 cents a share according to the average estimate of 16 analysts in a thomson reuters survey
8462290 the second quarter results included a 600 million 374 million after tax addition to u s lending credit reserves that reflects a deterioration of credit indicators beyond our prior expectation and a 136 million 85 million after tax charge to the fair market value of the companys retained interest in securitized cardmember loans

8462297 felicito al atl tico porque ha logrado un triunfo merecido
8462298 ante todo quiero felicitar al atl tico por su victoria de hoy ha sido una victoria merecida y el resultado ha sido muy claro
8462299 en la segunda mitad tuvimos posibilidades despu s del 2 0 tuvimos oportunidades pero ni hicimos gol y esa ha sido la diferencia y la clave del partido
8462300 no me ha gustado el resultado estoy decepcionado y a pesar de que el equipo haya avanzado en su juego no tengo motivos para estar contento
8462301 el atl tico es un gran equipo y est en disposici n de no recibir goles y de hacerlos porque tiene grandes delanteros
8462302 ha sido dura esta derrota tanto para nuestros seguidores como para el equipo va a ser dif cil superar este rev s eso est claro porque tenemos ahora dos d as para preparar el siguiente partido y superar esta adversidad
8462303 no puedo echar la culpa a los jugadores hemos jugado de forma ofensiva a partir del segundo gol y eso implica dejar m s espacios algo que el atl tico pudo aprovechar
8462304 los equipos espa oles tienen gran calidad t cnica y pueden jugar muy bien al f tbol pero no creo que hoy la diferencia haya sido tan grande la diferencia ha estado en la efectividad a la hora de marcar goles
8462305 es una enorme alegr a me quit un peso de encima
8462306 cada semana nos ponemos a prueba los entrenadores a nivel general la clasificaci n para la liga de campeones es una enorme alegr a por esta afici n y por esta gente que est muy entregada y que merece que les di semos una satisfacci n
8462307 el primer a o me dijeron que hab a que ir a uefa y fue por intertoto y sufrimos como animales y el segundo me dijeron que hab a que acabar entre los cuatro primeros me quito un peso de encima porque por lo menos entregamos los que nos pidieron cumplimos esto es de la temporada pasada
8462308 era un partido en el que todos nos ten amos que dejar la piel estoy muy contento por mis jugadores porque lo han trabajado y lo han sufrido mucho y por mi cuerpo t cnico sin ellos no habr a sido posible y por toda la gente que nos rodea que nos aporta su optimismo y su trabajo
8462309 quiero hacer extensiva una felicitaci n a ismael falc n abbiati z castro fabiano eller cl ber santana jurado reyes mista y thiago motta porque sin ellos no hubiera pasado lo que pas hoy
8462310 es un jugador que te da algo distinto siempre da todo lo que tiene es un joven adulto maduro y que est en buen estado de gracia l y su mujer nos vino bien su inyecci n la presencia de l y de maniche dio a la gente a la afici n a la prensa alas para pensar que pod amos remontar
8462311 le vi en el pasillo a maradona y estaba muy contento no para de empujar y animar a su yerno es un referente y da gusto que venga ya le he dicho que ahora tiene que venir a todos los partidos de champions que nos trae buena suerte
8462312 se ha comunicado a la federaci n peruana que argentina no acepta el cambio del estadio por lo que el encuentro se disputar en el monumental como se hab a establecido originalmente
8462313 esperamos un buen resultado del equipo aunque hay que se alar que resulta riesgoso hacer una reestructuraci n tan tajante como la que lleva a cabo silvio santander en este momento pues a cert menes como este siempre se debe llevar lo mejor que se tiene
8462314 los que se prestan para foguear a los j venes pero a torneos como el centrobasquet hay que llevar a veteranos probados
8462315 soy respetuoso de la decisi n del actual entrenador pero soy de la idea que el equipo debe contar con una combinaci n de veteranos y j venes pues as se logra un mejor desempe o por parte de la gente experimentada
8462316 sino que es una pol tica que siguen equipos exitosos como espa a brasil quienes en torneos importantes recurren a lo mejor que tienen para asistir a dichos compromisos
8462317 en el caso de islas v rgenes s llamaron a raja bell y adem s trajeron a sus jugadores que militan en equipos de estados unidos ser un rival muy complicado pues ser un cuadro con mucha experiencia
8462318 el hecho de que traigan a sus dos jugadores nba al horford y francisco garc a muestra que ellos vienen con todo y desean regresar a un campeonato mundial
8462319 no buscamos eso nosotros trabajamos para sacar adelante al basquetbol mexicano y nos estamos preparando para cuando haya elecciones las que est n previstas para antes de que termine este a o
8462320 the plans are dear to the souls of the beautiful goddesses for they are noble
8462321 nevertheless the debate did bring to an end the long and thorough period of trialling evaluation analysis and consultation
8462322 how can they possibly be talking about the guitarist from a band like white lion
8462323 tell obamaites that she made the case for obama and brought the convention cheering to its feet she can say that she told her supporters in the most explicit language possible to work hard for his election
8462324 bill and hillary when the speech was being drafted putting the stuff about obama on a scale and calibrating it word for word syllable by syllable until they had reached the perfect bare minimum about obama
8462325 i havent won too many of these grand slam matches so this feels pretty good
8462326 it was really about self belief i am feeling more and more comfortable in best of five set matches and i thought i handled it pretty well today
8462327 i played him twice this year already and its one all he beat me pretty convincingly last time so hopefully i can get a bit of revenge
8462328 right now my confidence is pretty high ive been playing pretty well these last four or five weeks so im feeling good
8462329 i had a really good match against james blake at the olympics i feel like i can keep this roll going
8462330 if i did it would just be a distraction so theres no point once you get on the court you can only do what youre capable of
8462331 its in the back of my mind its going to be an interesting tie for us and a tough one because chile are always difficult to play down there but well go in with good spirits and well do our best
8462332 lleytons not going to be around forever and were going to have to learn to deal with that eventually
8462333 hopefully hes going to be around for a few more years but who knows
8462334 i havent won too many of these grand slam matches so this feels pretty good
8462335 it was really about self belief i am feeling more and more comfortable in best of five set matches and i thought i handled it pretty well today
8462336 i played him twice this year already and its one all he beat me pretty convincingly last time so hopefully i can get a bit of revenge
8462337 right now my confidence is pretty high ive been playing pretty well these last four or five weeks so im feeling good
8462338 i had a really good match against james blake at the olympics i feel like i can keep this roll going
8462339 if i did it would just be a distraction so theres no point once you get on the court you can only do what youre capable of
8462340 its in the back of my mind its going to be an interesting tie for us and a tough one because chile are always difficult to play down there but well go in with good spirits and well do our best
8462341 lleytons not going to be around forever and were going to have to learn to deal with that eventually
8462342 hopefully hes going to be around for a few more years but who knows
8462343 thats that mike gallagher jerk f g neo con neo con neo con
8462344 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table
8462345 with kara by her side paula has some backup and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
8462346 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
8462347 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
8462348 following a secondary screening she was found to be in possession of what appeared to be cocaine and heroin
8462349 we had a few police officers on the 19 man trek
8462350 one was taking and photos with a large lens of the trees and flowers
8462351 he then discovered what looks like the remains of a body
8462352 it wasnt until the wind blew that you could really see it is in a harness there are goggles and it appears to be caught up in cables so presumably it is an airman
8462353 27 percent of hillary supporters say they will vote mccain
8462354 did you vote for hillary clinton in the democratic primary in your state
8462355 most models now show it is on a collision course for the gulf of mexicos productive regions with memories of hurricane katrina still fresh in most participants minds it is understandable that prices have broken sharply higher said john kilduff analyst at mf global
8462356 evacuating personnel not essential to producing and drilling operations in the gulf
8462357 it is really hard to get your head around the fact that when your child goes on an excursion they need to have a permission slip signed by the parent but the school is within its rights to take a child to the doctor to be put on the pill
8462358 pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us
8462359 the reason for the bounce is deciding not to take hillary clinton to take joe biden
8462360 not that joe bidens a bad choice but hillary clinton got the votes of 18 million democrats and biden got the votes of 9 000 i dont think hes adequately explained why he passed over hillary clinton
8462361 whats not smart is having underperforming schools year after year decade after decade not even measuring it not even recognising its happening and not even doing anything about it
8462362 theres no way a parent today can compare like schools with like schools
8462363 theres nothing available to the national government today that enables us to see across the nation on a comparable system which schools are falling behind and need extra resources
8462364 we want transparency and we are prepared to bring new and extra resources to the table to make a difference to disadvantaged schools and to make a difference on teacher quality
8462365 theres no point in the world with comparing a rich school on sydneys north shore with elizabeth north in south australia and how the school is going there
8462366 our whole plan is to analyse student population and compare like schools with like schools
8462367 what you should measure is if youve got like student populations
8462368 you can take that best practice to the school thats falling behind
8462369 were not only going to take the best practice there were going to take extra resources there
8462370 were pledging a school like that with difficulties would get resources of 500 000 a year extra to make a difference and to bring that school up to standard
8462371 with market conditions likely to remain volatile for the rest of this year delivering growth in the short term will continue to be challenging but we remain confident in the medium to long term outlook for the wealth management industry chief executive craig dunn who started in the position on january 1 said
8462372 while amp will prudently manage through these market conditions we will also continue to invest where we see potential growth opportunities that position us well over the medium to long term mr dunn said
8462373 m amp a can be legitimate but it would have to be strategically relevant he said
8462374 we expect margins to contract by 2 to 3 per cent per annum over the longer term because of the competitive market in which we operate he said
8462375 our capital strategy is aimed at enhancing this already strong position in the current climate increasing business flexibility to grow and further optimising our capital mix mr dunn said
8462376 it is time to take back the country we love and whether you voted for me of whether you voted for barack the time is now to reunite as a single party with a single purpose
8462377 none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and it is a fight we must win together
8462378 hillary couldnt have said it better none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines this is our one shot so lets roll up our sleeves
8462379 hes talking about his values on a consistent basis hes sending the signal yes hes a democrat but we have a seat at the table for people of faith
8462380 unless you go back to jimmy carter we havent had a candidate more faith friendly or more capable of outreach than
8462381 for i was hungry and ye gave me meat i was thirsty and ye gave me drink i was a stranger and ye took me in naked and ye clothed me i was sick and ye visited me i was in prison and ye came unto me
8462382 we never expected we would win over white evangelicals entirely our goal is to make progress especially in the young evangelicals
8462383 i think it would be tough for obama to have to go out there and get off message by responding to these groups
8462384 i write so that you may know how you ought to conduct yourselves in the house of god which is the church of god the pillar stylos and ground of the truth
8462385 whatever your hand finds to do do it with your might
8462386 therefore whether you eat or drink or whatever you do do all to the glory of god
8462387 its still too early to tell exactly what its going to do
8462388 if a tree comes through the roof and buries them underneath there theyre going to be on their own
8462389 the citizens should not be worried about the flooding again
8462390 it is time to change the quota regime and reduce imports which have unfortunately built up in recent years
8462391 agreements signed more than three years ago as part of the negotiations on wto accession are unfortunately no longer in russias interests
8462392 but the fact that it has been mentioned now is almost certainly linked with the rhetoric that weve had from georgia and from prime minister vladimir putin it has just been accelerated as a result of current events
8462393 we currently believe any reduction in russian quotas that weve heard about for next year will not have a significant impact on our business
8462394 i dont think were anticipating its going to be at a level thats going to be a big problem
8462395 russias decision has called into question its commitment to peace and security in the caucasus
8462396 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8462397 in particular to withdraw its forces behind the pre conflict lines
8462398 knee jerk calls for russia to be expelled from the g 8 or for eu russia or nato russia relations to be broken

8462472 i was reading my book the driver honked the horn slammed on the brakes and the train goes squish
8462473 not much was going through my head stuff happens i used to be with search and rescue and ive seen this from the other side often enough
8462474 everyone basically just grabbed their cellphones called 911 and made sure everybody was ok
8462475 considering the train did derail and depending on the volume of passengers that could have been on the train and if it were a different time of day things could have been substantially worse
8462476 the driver as well as a patient we took sustained the brunt of the collision because it was at the front of the train but even he is in stable condition at this point in time

8462478 i would say its unlikely that there will be any criminal charges from the police end i imagine it would be something that occupational health and safety and their own departments look at as far as the people involved will be dealt with

8462490 diversity is a rich element for the community but it brings challenges in terms of management

8462531 however our investment managers had actually taken some precautionary measures early in the downturn
8462532 because our reserves are invested with a long term horizon this long term orientation will keep us from selling in panic in a market downturn the downturns also offer opportunities for our agencies to invest in good quality assets at prices that are attractive from a long term perspective

8462605 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8462606 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package

8462608 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8462609 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8462610 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8462611 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8462612 within this international health partnership we propose to partner with the uk in making sure that this becomes a key achievable area of progress against the millennium development goals
8462613 it is estimated that more than 80 per cent of maternal deaths could be prevented or avoided through actions that are proven to be effective and affordable even in resource poor countries
8462614 we must speak up when violence is being committed against a woman child or man for that matter it is only by speaking up and challenging the perpetrators that we can truly start bringing about change
8462615 sick and tired of hearing about law enforcing agents continual response that these are domestic issues or an issue between relatives to be sorted out outside of police stations and courts
8462616 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8462617 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8462618 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8462619 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8462620 and then the fact that youve got illegals in there and you have no background checks theyre not doing any background checks so its putting our members safety at risk

8462624 one in six australians are affected by hearing loss so it is about time major cinema chains reflected this market share in the numbers of screens showing captioned movies
8462625 it is very disappointing that a sizeable section of the community is disadvantaged in this way said commissioner innes it is also hard to understand why in a very competitive market cinemas wouldnt be doing everything to maintain and increase their market share
8462626 no sector of the australian economy is more affected by climate change than agriculture
8462627 our farmers have the most to lose the cost of inaction is greater than the cost of acting to meet the challenges of the future
8462628 i would urge anyone working in agriculture or forestry to attend and make sure their views are heard
8462629 the rudd government has already made it clear that agriculture will not be included initially in the carbon pollution reduction scheme given the difficulty of measuring agricultural emissions at so many locations across australia
8462630 as we announced in july the government will make a decision on the inclusion of agricultural emissions in 2013
8462631 this will give us time to consult with industry starting with these regional forums in launceston and other areas
8462632 we want to hear from people in farming and forestry about how we could resolve these measurement issues before we could include agriculture in the scheme
8462633 one of my teachers recorded podcasts to help us review for tests which was helpful however if we could have created our own podcasts we could have learned even better because if you are teaching others you learn the material better

8462635 first of all he does not have large shares in at amp t
8462636 he wouldnt know a new idea if it hit him in the pachanga
8462637 if those works which god does are not human works and we hold that faith is a work which god does in us then you cannot suspect or charge us with any belief in salvation by works just because we hold that faith comes apart from water baptism
8462638 for faith is a work of god not of man as paul teaches
8462639 overall we had a good balance with him in the side
8462640 he could have stayed on he was disappointed twente didnt have a go because he always wants to test himself i took him off because he has only just come back from the hamstring injury
8462641 we want to play with the best and that means qualifying for the group stage i felt we were well organised disciplined and focused we were never really under threat
8462642 i felt the whole team was sharp physically we were much better than saturday we have been struggling for goals but i was never really worried it is difficult when you start the season with a champions league qualifier and an international
8462643 i was here on tuesday and they were talking about a crisis at arsenal
8462644 someone said it was the best time to play them after they lost to fulham but it was the worst time
8462645 fabregas is a big player he makes arsenal tick once you see him on the teamsheet its going to be hard
8462646 the fight was never between the people of permatang pauh
8462647 we know the people who support parti keadilan rakyat they are our neighbours and friends
8462648 it was mostly people who came from other places to campaign here who were aggressive
8462649 were not angry with bn adik were not angry at the leadership or anyone here
8462650 its just that the price of food and oil have gone up so much that we had to vote for the other side you understand
8462651 none of us permatang pauh folk sat down quietly in a corner feeling depressed or hurt

8462660 i was unable to contact the transient who started the fire we searched the area and he had gone

8462670 we can tell that theres a real economic change this year we dont have as much from merchants
8462671 this auction is important because without it we arent able to keep up with current technology and provide our teachers and students with the exceptional equipment that theyve come to rely on to meet their educational needs

8462677 ebay has often talked about the changes taking place in the marketplace and the younger demographic thats now using our website
8462678 we thought lets check in with some younger people give them a completely clean slate and see what they come up with in this way we could see what we need to do to address the needs of that audience
8462679 when we heard that saratoga high school had 21 students interested we were really excited
8462680 we knew students who were involved in the media arts had a whole host of skills and were looking for multimedia projects to work on
8462681 we came up with a list of students who might be interested and ended up with three great teams
8462682 ebay doesnt decide what the user wants the community does that
8462683 this is a great example of that interaction we got some wonderful suggestions with all of these designs
8462684 the use of fonts and graphics was fun and also very practical
8462685 their presentation was very well done thoroughly rehearsed and suggested elements that arent currently a part of our site
8462686 this group really captured all aspects of whats important to ebay and the viability of its web site
8462687 i can take what ive learned at ebay and apply it at school
8462688 it will really help me out when im looking for a job as well normally im not much of a team player but now i know what to expect and how i can manage people better if i become part of a team
8462689 what was unique about the project was that it had no limitations the question was simply what will ebay be like in 2015 it allowed us to stretch our imaginations and come up with some out there stuff
8462690 in only eight weeks we brainstormed created our prototype and planned and practiced our presentation the experience will help our group with future projects both in and out of school
8462691 ali coloca a roda ali agora vamos para acol vou bem siga curva e arrisca que j passou ao tempo que ouvimos a malta a berrar yeah altamente vou bem vamos l marco

8462719 for since in the wisdom of god the world through its wisdom did not come to know god god was well pleased through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe
8462720 i just got kicked out of a bible study for bringing my bible to it
8462721 the way you see your life shapes your life how you define life determines your destiny
8462722 god wont ask about your religious background or doctrinal views the only thing that will matter is did you accept what jesus did for you and did you learn to love and trust him
8462723 weve seen that the frequent solution for making the message more popular and appealing is to distort and misrepresent the gospel by pumping up the easy parts and downplaying or ignoring the hard parts
8462724 if you learn to love and trust gods son jesus you will be invited to spend the rest of eternity with him on the other hand if you reject his love forgiveness and salvation you will spend eternity apart from god forever
8462725 and after john had been taken into custody jesus came into galilee preaching the gospel of god and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent and believe in the gospel
8462726 he said to them thus it is written that the christ should suffer and rise again from the dead the third day and that repentance for forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all the nations beginning from jerusalem
8462727 right now god is inviting you to live for his glory by fulfilling the purposes he made you for
8462728 i invite you to bow your head and quietly whisper the prayer that will change your eternity jesus i believe in you and i receive you
8462729 if you sincerely meant that prayer congratulations welcome to the family of god
8462730 according to lots of churches and preachers the answer is to popularize the gospel get rid of all this slaying yourself and carrying your cross stuff and get a decent band up there on stage
8462731 listening to a seeker sensitive evangelical preacher today were likely to think its easy to be a christian just say these little words pray this little prayer and poof youre in the club
8462732 god loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life just say this little prayer and you will find out for yourself
8462733 you men who are stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears are always resisting the holy spirit you are doing just as your fathers did which one of the prophets did your fathers not persecute and they killed those who had previously announced the coming of the righteous one whose betrayers and murderers you have now become you who received the law as ordained by angels and yet did not keep it
8462734 people are breezing through those wide comfortable inviting gates with all their baggage their self needs their self esteem and their desire for fulfillment and self satisfaction and the most horrible thing about it is they think theyre going to heaven
8462735 but start preaching the true gospel the hard words of jesus that call for total and absolute self denial the recognition that were worth nothing commendable for nothing and that nothing in us is worth salvaging and thats a lot less popular
8462736 the bible says self help is no help at all
8462737 for whoever wishes to save his life shall lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake shall find it
8462738 self help is no help at all self sacrifice is the way my way to finding yourself your true self
8462739 its not about exalting me its about slaying me its the death of self you win by losing you live by dying and that is the heart message of the gospel
8462740 it is about becoming what god created you to be
8462741 its in christ that we find out who we are and what we are living for long before we first heard of christ he had his eye on us had designs on us for glorious living part of the overall purpose he is working out in everything and everyone
8462742 also we have obtained an inheritance having been predestined according to his purpose who works all things after the counsel of his will
8462743 just as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world
8462744 believe god has chosen you to have a relationship with jesus who died on the cross for you
8462745 spiritual growth is a collaborative effort between you and the holy spirit
8462746 god will give you what you need if you just make a choice to live for him
8462747 christlikeness is the result of making choices and depending on his spirit to help you fulfill those choices
8462748 for whom he foreknew he also predestined to become conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many brethren and whom he predestined these he also called and whom he called these he also justified and whom he justified these he also glorified
8462749 are you so foolish having begun by the spirit are you now being perfected by the flesh
8462750 and when you are praying do not use meaningless repetition as the gentiles do for they suppose that they will be heard for their many words
8462751 in the next chapter we will see four more secrets of cultivating a friendship with god
8462752 thus in the inspired word of the bible and only there we have the mind of god and the mind of christ
8462753 the last thing many believers need today is to go to another bible study they already know far more than they are putting into practice
8462754 therefore you are to be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect
8462755 i strongly urge you to gather a small group of friends and form a purpose driven life reading group to review these chapters on a weekly basis
8462756 after you have gone through this book together as a group you might consider studying other purpose driven life studies that are available for classes and groups
8462757 we will not walk in panourgia in trickery adulterating the word of god tampering with the gospel to make it less offensive in order for men to commend us instead we will be faithful to the gospel manifesting the truth in order to commend ourselves to every mans conscience with god watching
8462758 but noah found favor in the eyes of the lord
8462759 but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord
8462760 like a proud parent god especially enjoys watching you use the talents and abilities he has given you
8462761 see to it that you do not refuse him who is speaking for if those did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth much less shall we escape who turn away from him who warns from heaven
8462762 therefore since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken let us show gratitude by which we may offer to god an acceptable service with reverence and awe for our god is a consuming fire
8462763 for thus says the high and exalted one who lives forever whose name is holy i dwell on a high and holy place and also with the contrite and lowly of spirit in order to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of the contrite

8462831 the burgers came on these really fresh buttered rolls with fresh avocado my favorite fixin the paddies were slightly greasy clearly griddle cooked but they tasted like soy paddies almost not the nasty carrots and peas veggie burgers you get sometimes
8462832 its just too bad we wont get to continue to enjoy these veggielicious masterpieces
8462833 all the fries had the skin on which you know makes them twice as good some of them were really crispy but not that tough kind of crunchy that overcooked fires get we ordered mixed fries and most of them were sweet potato but i wont complain
8462834 try this place now not right before you pack up and leave the city who knows about the meat but their veggie burgers are top rate

8462848 president chavez has asked that i continue to work with the city and its new mayors to use the experience of london to actually give form to his dream that this can be a first world city in a first world country
8462849 i am proud and honoured to be in a position to be able to offer my advice to those candidates as they start the task of transforming this city for the benefit of all its people
8462850 boris johnson made it clear during his election campaign that he did not want to be on the payroll of hugo chavez and did not believe a poor south american country should be subsidising one of the wealthiest cities in the world
8462851 we are closely studying the board of marine inquiry report and we recommend the filing of criminal charges if the situation warrants
8462852 what happens is that if a character doesnt work we go we got a brand new direction to put him in were moving him into something new were going to try something brand new and different were going to throw everything out and start over again we make that mistake
8462853 is that were locking our characters down were going with a good interpretation and were staying with it thats why you dont see aquaman right now because we want it to be clear what it is who he is and what hes all about
8462854 so what the hell im sitting here eating my arugula salad and zucchini pasta catching up on last nights daily show sipping my chardonnay waiting for it to be late enough to bother to start watching the proceedings at the democratic national convention and suddenly barack obama has been nominated by acclamation the ostensible point of the convention choosing the nominee occurs more than an hour outside of prime time wtf
8462855 this convention is all about the clintons isnt it she dominated last night she controls the nomination tonight and the rest of the evening is the lead up to bill how awful for barack in his moment of triumph
8462856 christian ethics is not first of all concerned with thou shalt or thou shalt not its first task is to help us rightly envision the world christian ethics is specifically formed by a very definite story with determinative content if we somehow discover the world is not as that story suggests then we have good grounds for not believing in or more accurately not worshipping the god revealed in the life cross and resurrection of jesus in other words the enterprise of christian ethics primarily helps us to see we can only act within the world we can envision and we can envision the world rightly only as we are trained to see we do not come to see merely by looking but must develop disciplined skills through initiation into that community that attempts to live faithful to the story of god furthermore we cannot see the world rightly unless we are changed for as sinners we do not desire to see truthfully
8462857 you should have no story other than the story you chose when you had no story
8462858 for what it cannot acknowledge is that we did not choose the story that we should have no story except the story we choose when we had no story
8462859 christian convictions constitute a narrative a language that requires a transformation of the self if we are to see as well as be truthful the gospel commands us to submit to a vigorous and continuing discipleship if we are to recognize our status as subjects and properly understand the requirements for participation in the kingdom furthermore to be a christian is not principally to obey certain commandments or rules but to learn to grow into the story of jesus as the form of gods kingdom
8462860 we must love the age we live in sometimes this is very hard to do but it is our task
8462861 develop disciplined skills through initiation into that community that attempts to live faithful to the story of god
8462862 a community of seekers is not my ideal religious community but it does nevertheless embody many genuine virtues and include a large number of very interesting and inspiring people
8462863 anyway king will double surely be invoked in the speech so i am sticking with the lincoln memorial motif
8462864 glenn of course george w bush was president of the united states at the time the set is appropriate to his office unlike os stagecraft

8462866 with china mobile still holding roughly 70 market share of the total mobile subscriber base in china we are concerned that the provincial management staff of the other two mobile operators may act irrationally and attempt to gain market share at the expense of profitability
8462867 this year there will also be a raffle in which area companies are donating lakeshore made products and services
8462868 we created this event to celebrate the great companies and hard working employees who make our community so successful and what better time than labor day for this recognition

8462872 there isnt an issue at this years u s open of players not speaking english and those that dont speak english fluently still attempt to speak enough english to be able to conduct press conferences in that language
8462873 not considering any language programmes along the lines of what has been reported for the lpga
8462874 it has not been an issue the girls seem to pick up english pretty quickly
8462875 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8462876 a president obama will choose diplomacy first and military force as a last resort
8462877 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
8462878 i didnt play quite as well as i did the other day in the first round didnt find my rhythm but sometimes you just have to get through these matches
8462879 reimagine excel ncia nos neg cios numa era de desordem
8462880 a lu sempre participou das campanhas desde o in cio da minha vida p blica e faz isso com naturalidade
8462881 he has shown a clear grasp of our foreign policy and national security challenges
8462882 he will choose diplomacy first and military force as a last resort
8462883 but in a world troubled by terror by trafficking in weapons drugs and people by human rights abuses by other threats to our security our interests and our values when he cannot convert adversaries into partners he will stand up to them
8462884 so i could find out after scoring the personality test i wound up pretty darn close to my initial guess
8462885 no se les da a los integrantes de la banda ninguna compensaci n por su trabajo y s se cobra bastante por cada presentaci n dinero que van desde los diez mil pesos hasta los cien mil o m s como lo que se les pag en la presidencia de la rep blica o por la fundaci n harp en su momento en el aniversario del cecam
8462886 walk around the office carrying lots of papers with an agitated look on my face
8462887 this is the lead role and i dont have an understudy the things run like lightning i cant risk it
8462888 what hes got to do is get more specific not so much in terms of putting out white papers but really explaining to some of these undecided voters why is your life going to be better if you elect me
8462889 that middle 10 or 15 percent who may be ds or rs in their registration but theyre certainly willing to go either way

8462895 there is a russia narrative that we were weak in the 90s but now we are back and we are not going to take it anymore but being angry and seeking revanchist victory is not the sign of a strong nation it is the sign of a weak one
8462896 russia is going to have to come to terms with the reality it can either integrate with the world or it can be a self isolated bully but it cant be both and thats a choice russia has to have
8462897 they are kind of giddy they will need to sober up
8462898 when they sober up they will see that it is not the u s that has done things to them its that they have done things to themselves
8462899 today russia is more isolated less trusted and less respected than two weeks ago it has made military gains in the short term but over time it will feel economic and political losses
8462900 no one asked what impact its actions had on the russian stock market there was no russian stock market
8462901 russias decision has called into question its commitment to peace and security in the caucasus
8462902 the georgian people won their freedom after years of tyranny and they can count on the friendship of the united states
8462903 three american presidents bush clinton and bush have all in their own way sought to encourage russias integration with the wider world this is a good thing it was the right set of policies
8462904 russia has now put all of that at risk because russian cannot simultaneously behave like the soviet union toward its neighbors like this is 1968 and act as if it is 2008 when it comes to the wto
8462905 there are areas where we have common interest with russia and we want to work with them the question is whether russia has an ability to work with us
8462906 hoolly shit well im excited to see it but holy shit

8462921 against the backdrop of the drumbeat of negative news of the last several weeks it was encouraging to see a little bit of positive news
8462922 the basic fact of the matter is that although the economy has been weak it hasnt fallen off a cliff

8462934 barack is the right man for the job because i used to have that job and i say so
8462935 charles bryans vocabulary seems to be comprised of the phrase bill says to do this which he repeats to the men who think they are running this convention with monotonous regularity at that other words could seem to be superfluous for what charles says bill says to do is generally done and forthwith

8462937 effective actions are taken to alter the publics perception of coal
8462938 invent appliances to exhaust with over greater rapidity the hoard of coal
8462939 doubtless the end of the coal at least as an article of a mighty commerce will arrive within a period brief in comparison with the ages of human existence in the history of humanity from first to last the few centuries through which we are now passing will stand out prominently as the coal burning period
8462940 it is very sorrowful here but h will move us forward it will be very emotional tonight so many thousands of grieving people but seems some resolve coming the reality has set in it will be up to o to heal the party
8462941 tears everywhere in the center i think it opened healing wounds reminded people of why they voted for her in 1st place she was beautiful gracious and above herself so presidential emphasis added it is now up to o to bring us home on thursday
8462942 hillary has convinced me and i will follow she has unified the party i am with hillary and i support obama we must defeat mccain
8462943 but on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he john mccain still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years a philosophy we never had a real chance to see in action until 2001 when the republicans finally gained control of both the white house and congress then we saw what would happen to america if the policies they had talked about for decades were implemented
8462944 viral videos and social networks how campaigning has changed forever
8462945 people like videos that are funny that are shocking that are sexy
8462946 its not how are we are going to find the youth its how is the youth going to find us
8462947 im so proud to be a part of this convention
8462948 were talking about progress in the areas ive worked so hard on thats why im so proud to be an american
8462949 i know i grew up with the lessons of another generation my fathers generation i know his stories of struggle and sacrifice of fear and division i know america is still a place where dreams are too often deferred and opportunities too often denied
8462950 but heres what i also know i know that while america may not be perfect our union can always be perfected
8462951 i always fought for this day even though i didnt think it would get here
8462952 i expect that race will continue to be downplayed by the campaign as it has been
8462953 its taken 45 years to get to where martin luther king was talking about
8462954 bigotry is going to come to the forefront its going to rear its ugly head
8462955 all the work ive done the work of all kinds of black folks and white folks makes today possible by their fruit you should know them
8462956 they deserve the chance to be here and witness history
8462957 im just awestruck and i feel for the first time like im part of the process rather than just a witness to the process it would be inspiring to see a family in the white house that looks like my family

8462962 before we conducted these analyses we knew based on evidence from previous studies that we might expect acceleration in decline on cognitive abilities before death
8462963 and our findings clearly showed there to be a pattern of terminal decline even among relatively healthy individuals that the brain changes that influence our cognitive abilities in old age occur over a relatively long period of time even among individuals who remain non demented until they die
8462964 typically when you ask the question how does mental function change with age the older you get its easy to mix up people who are merely old with people who are in fact dying
8462965 illustrates very clearly that there is a certain period before death from so called natural causes where mental function declines at an accelerating pace and while most investigators had thought that this kind of decline begins between three to five years before death this study shows that it in fact can be traced back to a starting point that is a lot earlier than previously thought

8462988 im excited to just be a part f it in any way
8462989 were talking about a very serious issue here that also has huge economic implications
8462990 unfortunately we have no policy framework and there are so many agencies involved with very little coordination between them
8462991 blame must be shared equally at the institutional level the engineering level and the consumer level
8462992 safety is unfortunately not a big part of the purchase decision of indian consumers
8462993 our best selling small cars are typically not the safest vehicles on the road because consumers are more worried about fuel efficiency and the cost of ownership and would rather not pay for safety features such as air bags and anti lock brakes
8462994 the system is strictly a local account and has no network
8462995 kondisi likuiditas suatu negara dalam lingkup globalisasi ini tergantung dari masing masing termasuk aliran modal yang keluar masuk dan sekarang ini banyak likuiditas yang keluar masuk tapi kalau keluar akan makin ketat ini tergantung pada situasi finansial global jadi kita tidak bisa lepas dari hal semacam itu kita harus waspadai kita jangan lalu melawan arus terlalu banyak dengan perkembangan global

8463019 were here to nominate a candidate for president of the united states could you imagine what would happen if something happened and the police werent here
8463020 one on hand its very reassuring in terms of knowing that when we need a police presence its there
8463021 so for example if there were to be riots in town or god forbid a terrorist attack or other things that are security related its kind of like our own version of homeland security
8463022 if theres anything on the negative side its kind of the sense of hummm we have all these bigwigs in town where were you when i needed you
8463023 is it supposed to make us feel safe but it doesnt
8463024 its a small price to pay for hosting a tremendously big important event that is the center of the worlds attention

8463029 i want everybody to now understand why i am so proud to have joe biden and the whole biden family

8463035 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8463036 ive been on the ground in georgia iraq pakistan and afghanistan and i can tell you in no uncertain terms this administrations policy has been an abject failure
8463037 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8463038 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8463039 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8463040 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8463041 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8463042 be there because barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8463043 joe biden is right we need more than a good soldier we need a leader with the experience and judgment to serve as commander in chief from day one that leader is john mccain
8463044 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need

8463056 yes but im not looking for something specific i just want to start browsing through box one
8463057 well have you looked online we can find you something more specific
8463058 ummmmm like i said im going to be here like every other day for the next five years id just like to start at box one
8463059 well let me show you what im talking about online
8463060 yes ive already seen this i have the call number right here
8463061 okay take a seat and i guess ill get you box one
8463062 what a year we democrats have had the primary began with an all star line up and came down to two remarkable americans locked in a hard fought contest to the very end the campaign generated so much heat it increased global warming in the end my candidate didnt win but im very proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children and im grateful for the chance chelsea and i had to tell americans about the person we know and love now im not so grateful for the chance to speak in the wake of her magnificent address last night but ill do my best
8463063 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she will do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8463064 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8463065 most important barack obama knows that american cannot be strong abroad unless we are strong at home people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8463066 look at the example the republicans have set americans workers have given us consistently rising productivity theyve worked hard and produced more what did they get in return declining wages less than 1 4 as many new jobs as in the previous eight years smaller health care and pension benefits rising poverty and the biggest increase in income inequality since the 1920s
8463067 america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that but first we have to elect him
8463068 the republicans will nominate a good man who served our country heroically and suffered terribly in vietnam he loves our country every bit as much as we all do as a senator he has shown his independence on several issues but on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years a philosophy we never had a real chance to see in action until 2001 when the republicans finally gained control of both the white house and congress then we saw what would happen to america if the policies they had talked about for decades were implemented
8463069 now their candidate is promising more of the same more tax cuts for the wealthiest americans that will swell the deficit increase inequality and weaken the economy more band aids for health care that will enrich insurance companies impoverish families and increase the number of uninsured more going it alone in the world instead of building the shared responsibilities and shared opportunities necessary to advance our security and restore our influence
8463070 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more lets send them a message that will echo from the rockies all across america thanks but no thanks in this case the third time is not the charm
8463071 sixteen years ago we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8463072 barack obama will lead us away from division and fear of the last eight years back to unity and hope if like me you still believe america must always be a place called hope then join hillary chelsea and me in making senator barack obama the next president of the united states
8463073 ladies and gentleman the coverage of barack obama was embarrassing
8463074 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8463075 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8463076 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8463077 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8463078 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8463079 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8463080 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8463081 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
8463082 im zweiten quartal verloren die deutschen tageszeitungen 2 2 prozent der auflage gegen ber 2007

8463084 nun ja eine beschreibung die auch auf jeden blog passen k nnte ausgew hlt wird schlie lich auch da und auch nicht nur die verlobte von boris becker ganz im gegenteil solche klatschgeschichten kommen dort ganz im gegensatz zu den etablierten medien eher selten vor
8463085 nie waren handwerklich und ethisch gut ausgebildete journalisten notwendiger als heute um das berleben des qualit tsjournalismus in der digitalen welt zu sichern
8463086 enth lt wenig was neu oder berpr fbar w re
8463087 drohen die medien zum surrealen kettenbrief digitaler illusionen und t uschungen zu werden wo die fakten durch meinungen und die professionellen nachrichtensammeler von durchgeknallten kommentatoren ersetzt werden
8463088 die polizeidirektion werra mei ner fahndet jetzt mit einem phantombild nach einem der t ter der an den k rperverletzungen in bad sooden allendorf beteiligt war
8463089 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8463090 i think we need to see the united states and see the world through eyes that are younger through eyes that have dreams through eyes that see something new for the nation
8463091 youve got a situation where its not possible to lose militarily
8463092 its also going to require more than military power to prevail
8463093 fcc you can have a geat iq and still be mentally unbalanced rummy is full of himself
8463094 i can promise you people like myself wouldnt stand for it and i dont think i could be wrong they would be able to enforce it

8463098 baldric that is the most ridiculous idea i have ever heard of
8463099 it is important for people to watch and realize that this video is conclusive proof that 9 11 was orchestrated by al qaeda at the most senior levels
8463100 a super power is at bay over a few scruffy terrorists i dont think so
8463101 sailor shocked by killing of iraqi http news yahoo com s ap 20061007 ap on re us marines iraq shooting by linda deutsch ap special correspondent sat oct 7 4 32 am et camp pendleton calif saying he was unable to stop the bloodshed a navy corpsman testified that marines in his patrol seized an iraqi civilian from his home threw him into a hole and shot him at least 10 times after growing frustrated in their search for an insurgent slight and soft spoken petty officer 3rd class melson j bacos said friday he saw a marine put fingerprints from the victim onto a rifle and a shovel to implicate him as an insurgent
8463102 the iraqis are no more than innocent casualities caused by terrorist infiltrating iraq to keep the people down and out
8463103 george should have starved the iraqis into submission with the goal of getting saddam to resign
8463104 uh i havent thought about that enough to give an answer
8463105 more and more states are beginning to realize how important it is to protect the rights of teachers to be able to present all of the scientific evidence when teaching biological evolution
8463106 science education is in a crisis because students are merely taught what to think but not how to think and these bills will help remedy that problem
8463107 intellectual pluralism and students right to learn in an environment that exposes them to an abundance of new knowledge different perspectives competing ideas and alternative claims of truth
8463108 heres a novel idea how about using some real common sense how about agreeing to disagree and concentrate some of our energy and thought toward solving some of the real problems that we face world hunger disease and pollution that is slowly turning the big blue marble into a garbage dump to name a few as far as teaching evolution or intelligent design in our public schools ask the children ask a child who hasnt had breakfast or a bath or clean clothes for a week which he or she prefers im sure you can find many in springfield in the aforementioned category ask a child who has had a parent killed or maimed for life in this senseless war in iraq or ask any of the thousands of neglected abused children who have slipped through the cracks in our great society whether they prefer to be taught intelligent design or creationism i suspect you will find there are many things more important than either intelligent design or evolution or a combination of the two who knows who cares the bottom line is this makes no difference if we are living on this big chunk of terra firma compliments of the god of abraham or we are the fifth grade science project of some kid in a galaxy a million light years away in a society so far advanced we cant comprehend truthfully i dont know and no matter what you think you dont either and neither does billy graham the pope osama bin laden or steve sanderson so lets forget this stupid argument concentrate on teaching our children to think for themselves concerning issues like this and get busy solving some of the real problems that face us today
8463109 it is my hope that people will not take what is said in the film as the truth

8463119 again though i ask what do we do with these men and yes women who have served what
8463120 with the selection of senator joe biden as senator obamas vice president the democrats ticket has now become an even greater gamble for the jewish community throughout his career senator biden has consistently been wrong on iran and his voting record on israel has been inconsistent like obama biden fundamentally misunderstands the threat posed by an iran determined to obtain nuclear weapons biden has continuously demonstrated poor judgment on iran he has voted against significant legislation that would pressure iran to stop pursuing nuclear weapons biden has failed to recognize the serous threat that iran poses to israel and the u s and its allies in the middle east
8463121 iran is not a nuclear threat to the united states of america
8463122 the jewish community was already gravely concerned with senator obamas naive understanding of the iranian threat
8463123 thats a fair question i just dont know the answer
8463124 the torch has been passed to a new generation of americans

8463139 you know that the rulers of the gentiles lord it over them and their high officials exercise authority over them not so with you instead whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant and whomever wants to be first must be your slave just as the son of man did not come to be served but to serve
8463140 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back
8463141 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need

8463143 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world

8463147 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history

8463149 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8463150 and just in case you were wondering i think president bill clinton reminded us of what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first

8463170 de repente fue una expresi n general refiri ndose tambi n a los que no han sido tomados en cuenta para esta ocasi n la respuesta las palabras de del solar no es orientada exclusivamente a los que fueron sancionados
8463171 creo que los t cnicos suelen escuchar no solo a la prensa sino tambi n a los dirigentes y a sus jugadores si ellos lo piden ser evaluado por el t cnico sucedi algo parecido con el tema de jayo en alianza
8463172 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time

8463181 it was miz myers the new lady that moved in next door she wanted to know if she could borrow a cup of sugar
8463182 regrettably we are not surprised that mr boras would attempt to raise a meritless legal claim in an effort to compel us to renegotiate pedros contract to one more of his liking
8463183 we are however disappointed that pedro would allow his agent to pursue this claim on his behalf pedro showed tremendous fortitude and independent thinking when he agreed to his contract on aug 15
8463184 was done without notice to or consultation with the players association despite a firm deadline having been established through collective bargaining
8463185 it is the unions obligation on behalf of all players to defend the integrity of its collectively bargained agreements
8463186 mr boras is apparently satisfied with the 6 million bonus that he secured for mr hosmer and has not challenged the validity of that contract
8463187 mr boras has been informed that if he pursues a claim that our contract with pedro was not timely he puts eric hosmers contract with kansas city in jeopardy
8463188 the deadline was extended to accept minor league contracts voluntarily entered into by the clubs and the players with the help of their agents
8463189 it is settled law that the arbitration panel has no authority to disturb such minor league contracts
8463190 we agreed in the appropriate time frame and the terms were submitted in a timely matter
8463191 eric hosmer is completely satisfied with the terms of his contract and is completely satisfied with being part of this organization
8463192 everybody is out there for one reason thats to try to get to october

8463213 the government is on the verge of making a massive costly and hugely damaging mistake that will destabilise the criminal justice system for years to come
8463214 giant us style prisons may be easier to build but all the evidence here and abroad says the price we would pay in running them and in higher re offending rates is far too high if ministers want prisons to be focused on rehabilitation rather than warehousing offenders until they are released then it is not too late to make these plans disappear as fast as they appeared
8463215 our first priority is protecting the public and we are committed to providing enough prison places for those who should be behind bars the most dangerous serious and persistent offenders we believe titan prison complexes are an essential part of a modernised prison estate that they will be the most effective way of providing value for money for taxpayers and of keeping them safe by reducing re offending

8463218 were going to talk to mats in the middle of this week and try to get a feel for where hes at
8463219 theres no timetable for a decision were just going to try to see how hes feeling
8463220 we just want him to make a decision because hes holding up the business of the league right now
8463221 there are teams that want to make deals but they cant do anything until they find out where sundin is going to go
8463222 id just like him to do something so i can get a few things done myself
8463223 the longer this takes the longer its going to be for teams to get their rosters settled
8463224 a physicians responsibility is to place the needs of the patient first so there will be times when it may be necessary for physicians to set aside their personal beliefs in order to ensure that patients or potential patients are provided with the medical services they require
8463225 physicians should be aware that decisions to restrict medical services offered or to end physician patient relationships that are based on moral or religious belief may contravene the human rights code and or constitute professional misconduct
8463226 this trend is pretty astounding but what i make of it is that catholic school boards face parents who have a choice and as a result they may manage their resources better
8463227 stronger results at catholic boards suggest that competition improves school results since catholic parents can choose to send their children to either catholic or public schools
8463228 catholic board managers may be responding by improving the quality of education to attract students and funding
8463229 but it sort of makes sense that the level of service will be higher in a system where people have a choice
8463230 we went through an election where we decided we were not going to fund faith based independent schools without ever really having a serious debate about whether opening up active competition between schools would produce better learning outcomes
8463231 thats an absolute leap with no sound basis its a huge leap to say this means we should have faith based schools
8463232 it might be that parents who choose to send their children to a catholic school are more engaged in their childrens education by virtue of the fact they have made that selection
8463233 or it could be there is a more homogeneous ethos in the school a sense of shared community values and a sense of identity as a group a factor also believed to promote learning said fullan
8463234 but this sort of ethos can be created in public schools as well by promoting lots of deep moral values such as equity and fairness i would call these spiritual values even though theyre secular things like cooperation and cohesion
8463235 heads of the class a comparison of ontario school boards by student achievement
8463236 the toronto district school board does fabulous work and this business of one system being better than the other is really misleading
8463237 our whole purpose is to address the needs of the whole student including their spiritual health something the public schools have no mandate to address
8463238 but we know that a student with confidence and a sense of well being will learn better and our schools spend half an hour every day telling students that theyre loved they have a purpose in
8463239 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8463240 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8463241 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8463242 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8463243 to ensure that day 7 can air uninterrupted in its entirety
8463244 where it takes place in canada or elsewhere all of these places have publics who can be intimidated whether by bringing down canadian airplanes setting off bombs in nightclubs or tube
8463245 it makes no difference in law whether the public or government sought to be intimidated is in canada or is anywhere else in the world
8463246 that would have to be established by evidence and there isnt any up to this point
8463247 for him to now pretend to be surprised caught off guard or in any way prejudiced is disingenuous in the extreme
8463248 was by no means the end of the groups and mr khawajas intentions
8463249 doesnt need to know who was going to get it he just needs to build a working device and he has agreed to do it because the bros are working for the same cause of jihad that he is working for with its worldwide implications but he knows hes dealing with a group in london
8463250 what he actually did was set himself up as a quartermaster of terror providing money and medical supplies night vision goggles and outdoor gear as well as devices for use by certainly
8463251 in momin khawajas view the world is divided into two camps the faithful and the kuffar non believers that his moving spirit is in his own words jihad against the west all out that he
8463252 the government is getting into prescriptive behaviour through the college
8463253 there are times when it may be necessary for physicians to set aside their personal beliefs in order to ensure that patients or potential patients are provided with the medical services they require
8463254 it seems that somebody is implying that you need to practise with a conscience but not your conscience
8463255 im not sure why they want to restrain that now it needs to be clarified
8463256 our obligation is to bring to ontario doctors attention what their obligations are under law
8463257 we are able to see the scrolls in such detail that no one has before
8463258 the only thing organized that way is the senior mens program
8463259 its a critical time to use the momentum weve gained over the past three years to make us even stronger in basketball
8463260 ill help in some capacity in consulting in whatever they need to do
8463261 we won a gold medal represented our country well and the question is now where do we go from here and how do we get better
8463262 how do we make this a much better program and make it fashionable to play for the usa we want people to have an intense desire to play for their country out of high school college and the nba i know the guys who did were ecstatic and a number want to do it again
8463263 i know theyre not lebron james and kobe bryant krzyzewski said
8463264 my wife told me that i looked like i was back coaching at army
8463265 this was so fulfilling and when it ends up that you do win winning in a very good way where our guys represented our game so well it just cant get any better than that for me
8463266 its huge its a big win for the global hawk program for northrop grumman and for this area
8463267 anytime in military programs you dont want to get too comfortable what it does is it shows an appreciation for their performance and it shows a level of job security
8463268 this again doubles the program but it could almost triple and quadrouple when you consider the international opportunities
8463269 i dont think harper has to be thinking about a majority at all
8463270 strategically this is sort of a prolonged war of attrition
8463271 you can fight a war with some objective less than total victory
8463272 would be enough to throw the liberals into turmoil and give harper a virtually free hand in parliament for quite a while and really handicap his main opponent
8463273 likes lighting ambience nice fun party vibe tvs to watch bball games when youre bowling tastly delicious munchies good times for a group
8463274 organisations going for the informal approach can lack structure in their environmental policies and this can affect the level of success that they achieve in reducing both energy costs and co2 emissions
8463275 while computers may drive efficiency the data centres that run businesses are often far from efficient they are at the heart of environmental challenges created by it but the average retailer just does not have the necessary knowledge to bring about change they need specialist help and the actions we offer in our thought leadership initiatives are designed to illustrate how they can improve their carbon footprint and wider environmental position while also reducing operating costs and improving it service delivery
8463276 advocating mortal life do unto others as you would have them do unto you as if you were them
8463277 after so many postponements i can assure you that none of us at 24 took for granted the significance of this upcoming season
8463278 but the time allowed us to do something that has never been done before create a map of the entire season before we started shooting so i can tell you without hesitation i know for a fact that season 7 is going to be the best season yet
8463279 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8463280 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8463281 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8463282 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8463283 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8463284 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8463285 in this last week that i havent talked to you i swear my morals started coming back
8463286 in the end close is all there is cause you wont find this
8463287 it is indeed a bit behind other 3g technologies but
8463288 noahs haddonfield a halloween fan film dvd david the goose gooslin made a fan film that lasts close to forty minutes and that is about michael myers and the events that perhaps happened between the end of the first film and when michael decides to make his way to hospital to kill laurie strode his sister in the second film

8463291 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8463292 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8463293 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8463294 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8463295 i dont know whats going on over there but theyre going crazy
8463296 we usually start back up at the end of july and i dont think were starting until a couple of weeks into august now its kind of exciting because i think the postponement means that theyre really having to dig in there and come up with new stuff
8463297 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8463298 thats something obviously were going to have to explain away
8463299 hopefully in the spirit of creating a good show and creating an interesting season people will allow the fun of 24
8463300 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8463301 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8463302 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8463303 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8463304 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8463305 with ctu dismantled the shows setting moves to washington d c where jack bauer faces trial for his actions in the pursuit of justice
8463306 bauers day gets off to a shocking start when former colleague tony almeida played by carlos bernard last seen in day 5 returns after being left for dead by a terrorist conspirator in ctus infirmary
8463307 tonys uncertain fate left the door open for his return
8463308 and since there was no silent clock at the conclusion of his last appearance the 24 tribute to a major characters demise we always kept this as a possibility
8463309 7 59 p m jack enters the clinic and finds tony and burke on the ground gasping his last breath of life tony tells jack that he couldnt do it jack clutches tonys head tony dies and jack cries with him still in his arms
8463310 8 00 p m as the medic workers wrap up tonys body audrey comes to tell jack that henderson has escaped however chloe was able to decrypt a file on his computer and she found an intelligence broker named collette stenger who is a known associate of bierko
8463311 i had a bulletproof vest on me so i was just in shock and the medics thought i was dead
8463312 heres another pointless just for shock value death in season five 1
8463313 if were going to do this were going to have to do it now
8463314 the change was due to the time of day the hearing would take place and other story concerns but the purpose is the same
8463315 but joel will tell you this the politics on the show are very varied
8463316 hes really at one end of the spectrum and most of us are not not at all
8463317 but i also feel that the storytelling is pretty apolitical
8463318 you assume former president david palmer was a democrat and former president charles logan was a republican but theres no reason to assume that we purposely stay away from depicting any real domestic issues partly because its distracting from the stories were trying to tell were not the west wing and also we dont want to alienate 50 percent of the audience
8463319 i think we intend to have him torture people less simply because we as writers have done it a lot and we always want to do something different
8463320 the critics kind of savaged us a little bit last year i thought mostly unfairly so it was nice to see that the fans as i kind of suspected stick with the show even if theyre momentarily disappointed about one thing or another
8463321 its very difficult to map things out and when you try to do that everything starts to feel stale
8463322 by nature of what the show is we almost have to let it be very fluid
8463323 good thing as traveling from ny to africa wouldve put jack on a plane for about half the season smart move
8463324 genius idea not but i bet these guys are creaming in their jeans
8463325 remember the spectacular second season of 24 when president palmer the believable president palmer and jack bauer the believable jack bauer were trying to keep the believable terrorists from blowing up l a i got that season on dvd and sat there in front of my tv hour after hour slamming in new discs and hoping that jack would whack the abusive father who was terrorizing kim last seasons 24 was only a pale imitation but ill be back next year hoping for a return to the good stuff more thrills less filler
8463326 the bottom line is it is a nuisance for us

8463349 hes done everything for this organization they told joe take as much time as he needs there will always be a place here for you no pressure
8463350 for sure i was worrying and a bunch of us were worrying about what was going to happen because we know were a much better team when hes in the lineup now that he made the right decision everybodys pumped we know how much better we are when joes in
8463351 if you insist on a quick answer youre probably going to get the answer you dont want if you insist on an answer now it might be no if you give me more time it might be yes
8463352 teams asked if they could at least submit an offer for consideration and joe told me to advise teams not to bother

8463362 you really need both protocols and infrastructure for everyday use of the internet but without dns packets can still get from ip address to ip address the converse does not hold my friend dan kaminsky recently made the well known dns cache poisoning trick very easy to pull off so on that aspect i think the dns attack might be a bit more accessible to many people

8463382 john mccain has served his country with honor but his refusal to change course even in the face of the failed policies of bush cheney is reckless and will not keep us safe
8463383 sen mccain says that american troops should remain in iraq perhaps as long as they have been stationed in korea and japan as if there were no difference in history religion or culture between our friends in asia and those in the middle east
8463384 weve been in south korea weve been in japan for 60 years weve been in south korea for 50 years or so thatd be fine with me as long as americans as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed then its fine with me i hope it would be fine with you if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where al qaida is training recruiting and equipping and motivating people every single day
8463385 in the last two years sen obama helped pass the new gi education bill

8463460 we have had some cancelations its been primarily our louisiana customers because of the situation of their homes
8463461 theyre not concerned about our beaches their vacations here their more concerned about what may or may not happen at their own home places
8463462 asking our cancellation prolicy and asking about our opiniopns of course on what we think will happen which were unable to predict

8463476 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8463477 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8463478 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8463479 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

8463502 but wilson is no mere shock jock and while her revelations about pop culture occasionally restate the obvious they do so in terms so hilariously biting as to render them almost canonical
8463503 so the first step entailed switching over to an excerpt format with which readers could get a taste of our posts on the homepage before diving in to read them in full
8463504 weve also taken a minimalist approach to design that uses lots of whitespace and gives priority to our main content with a wider post width and a larger font size no more squinting on that high resolution monitor
8463505 as far as particular features go a new featured posts box sits adjacent to the second post on the homepage and in the sidebar of every single post page its intended to highlight some of the content you might otherwise overlook with a tab for the most recent posts and another for those that garnered the most comments in the past few days weve also started to measure the traffic to our individual posts more closely and will add a tab with the most popular posts as well
8463506 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8463507 you are a f idiot with no brain and i want to f kill myself just to spite you
8463508 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
8463509 although the skirts are just a small part of the changes
8463510 they may spark a revolution by changing the image of table tennis
8463511 nothing about next season has been absolutely decided as of yet
8463512 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8463513 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8463514 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8463515 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8463516 you mustnt talk about war and certainly never mention ustashe in the theatre
8463517 i spent my whole life fighting nationalism and it was all for nothing
8463518 you know this would be seen as offensive in britain
8463519 we are not racist we dont even dislike black people we just hate serbs
8463520 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8463521 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8463522 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8463523 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8463524 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8463525 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8463526 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8463527 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8463528 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8463529 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8463530 who are open to doing something on the production side
8463531 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8463532 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8463533 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

8463539 nanosolids slushes and nanoliquids characterization of nanophases in metal clusters and nanoparticles
8463540 for convenience we call the particles with a diameter less than 1 nm clusters and those with diameters larger than 1 nm nanoparticles
8463541 for the particle sizes studied here most atoms need to be classified as surface atoms rather than as interior atoms with bulk properties characteristic of a macroscopic particle
8463542 first of all mccain is a westerner and he knows what is important to montanans and about western issues on the other hand obama needs to come to montana and to the west to learn about issues that we care about i think that most of montana will be comfortable with the fact that mccain knows those issues
8463543 looks like the dems agree obamas uncle is more qualified to be president than obama is seriously is this what they have to do for validity
8463544 as a senator he has shown his independence on several issues but on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years a philosophy we never had a real chance to see in action until 2001

8463552 there are files from all kinds of sources that we want to store and manage files are created by our digital cameras e mail cell phones portable media players camcorders pdas and laptops increasingly computer users are using different folders drives and even different computers such as a laptop and a desktop to store manage retrieve and view files yet managing hundreds or thousands of files is still largely a manual operation in some cases it is necessary to regularly get copies of files from another location to add to primary location in other cases there is a need to keep two storage locations exactly in sync some users manage files manually dragging and dropping from one place to another and keeping track of whether the locations are synchronized in their heads other users may use two or more applications to provide this functionality now there is an easier way synctoy a free powertoy for microsoft windows is an easy to use highly customizable program that helps users to do the heavy lifting involved with the copying moving and synchronization of different directories most common operations can be performed with just a few clicks of the mouse and additional customization is available without additional complexity synctoy can manage multiple sets of folders at the same time it can combine files from two folders in one case and mimic renames and deletes in another case unlike other applications synctoy actually keeps track of renames to file s and will make sure those changes get carried over to the synchronized folder

8463570 people around the world have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8463571 this new series will be of the same caliber as the other two these writers know what they are doing they can write good television youve been with us this long stay with us for the ninth inning itll be worth it and thank you for the five years youve given us
8463572 access economics estimates the cost of obesity to the community is 58 billion a year only 1 per cent of food advertising promotes healthy food the other 99 per cent promotes fast food soft drinks ice cream and other junk food
8463573 a national ban on junk food advertising during childrens tv viewing hours is a sensible first step in tackling childhood obesity an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
8463574 the nsw cancer council released a study which found that food advertisers were deliberately targeting children they also found 194 separate breaches of the childrens television standards code of practice involving mainly giveaways and prizes
8463575 in december 2004 the australia institute commissioned a survey of over 1600 australians in which 86 of respondents agreed that there should be more limits on advertising to children
8463576 the rudd government should assist parents by ending its obstruction of efforts to introduce a national junk food advertising ban during childrens tv viewing hours
8463577 if we dont protect our kids by removing hot dogs sausages and deli slices and pepperoni from our schools were stacking the cards against them lifetime cancer risk is already one in three for women and one in two for men given the terrible eating habits of so many american children were setting them up for even worse odds down the road
8463578 one of our first feedbacks on amaze told us that the player remembers playing this game with a steel ball and the wooden maze once he was a kid he was totally astonished by the game its a real pleasure for us to ensure the game youve never experienced since your childhood
8463579 if he hasnt played in the preseason it would be hard to start him
8463580 well se ora there are three reasons why i want an increase the first is that i iron better than you
8463581 the second reason is that i am a better cook than you
8463582 nonsense who said you were a better cook than me
8463583 my third reason is that i am a better lover than you
8463584 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8463585 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8463586 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8463587 it shall be known that in 2008 the world will be blessed
8463588 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8463589 this is the first time all 27 buddhist orders have held a rally
8463590 this government is trying to evangelise the whole country and turn it into a protestant state
8463591 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8463592 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8463593 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8463594 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8463595 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8463596 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8463597 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8463598 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8463599 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8463600 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8463601 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world

8463604 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8463605 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8463606 this is an important and critical milestone of achievement for mhc said daniel ballesteros chair of the mhc board of trustees

8463608 a sign of success for them said peter jensen director of the san jose general services department the city agency thats now managing operation of the plaza
8463609 it created an incentive for us to work to raise money she said
8463610 showed theres a lot of support for our mission and people want us to succeed
8463611 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8463612 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8463613 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8463614 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8463615 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8463616 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8463617 we are ready to go as far as we have to to keep our children out of the class regardless of the consequences
8463618 theres nothing wrong and we have no problem with the goals of the course which is to promote tolerance and promote getting along with people around you
8463619 is there a way to determine whats right and whats wrong or do we just say that everything stays status quo and nobody can ever know
8463620 thats not the way laws are changed thats not the way society changes and improves ethics have to supersede law and culture
8463621 is it right for the government to say all people in quebec society have to subscribe to one particular type of philosophy which is what this is its a kind of relativistic philosophy
8463622 we have talked a lot during training about doing the little things and paying attention to detail at times tonight i think we showed what we are capable of doing
8463623 still our competition is only going to continue to get tougher and we need to focus on the consistency of our efforts and execution played well tonight she worked very hard to get that second goal and in the entire game
8463624 we are creating a neighborhood gym that is as comfortable and effective as any other
8463625 at the same time our members are doing their part to help the earth
8463626 yes it isnt a lot of power but it is better than nothing and there is gratification in actually doing something during your workout
8463627 ive noticed in the past year or two that more club owners are becoming more interested in going green
8463628 people in general are paying more attention to being more environmentally friendly
8463629 club owners and their staffs are aware of this and they know their members are too
8463630 it appeals to people who want to walk or bike to the gym and then go home and shower
8463631 its the perfect business for portland and the timing is perfect
8463632 its time to be more conscious about everything we do
8463633 there is tremendous interest in our community in energy conservation alternative transportation fitness and healthy eating and lifestyles
8463634 we have a large and growing population of college educated 25 to 35 year olds and they are here because they care about being green need affordable places to live and want to create not just consume the local culture

8463640 with the credit crunch squeezing household budgets people can ill afford this extra tax grab its dishonest and unjust for politicians to wrap revenue raising tax hikes in a green banner
8463641 the government is talking about raising taxes even further but our conclusions show that green taxes should be kept as they are or cut
8463642 the government is on the verge of making a massive costly and hugely damaging mistake that will destabilise the criminal justice system for years to come
8463643 giant us style prisons may be easier to build but all the evidence here and abroad says the price we would pay in running them and in higher re offending rates is far too high if ministers want prisons to be focused on rehabilitation rather than warehousing offenders until they are released then it is not too late to make these plans disappear as fast as they appeared
8463644 but this is about as deep in the country as you can get
8463645 when the eldest son marries his wishes are of no importance what matters is family the two families negotiate the engagement and a bride is chosen who is acceptable to the grooms parents thats how it was with my parents and my grandparents did the same
8463646 you are the only one who can protect myna you know
8463647 i think you sensed it too but myna was drawn less to me than to
8463648 hurry up the grooms supposed to sit there the whole time the entire family is here and were going to drink the night away
8463649 im in town on a buying trip so i thought id stop by to say hello
8463650 if only she could speak with people myna is trying her best to learn our language but my mother and the other relatives make no attempt to learn hers not so much as a good morning or a thank you they insist its up to the daughter in law to do all the adapting
8463651 you should come to visit us now and then kaim myna would love to see you too
8463652 you promised me youd make her happy remember we agreed that youre the only one who can do that
8463653 sorry i havent got time for this i have to get this ship loaded before it sails at sunset
8463654 im starting to think that maybe in the long run tying myna down to a life in my village is just going to make her unhappy
8463655 if youre convinced its the right thing then go ahead and do it its not for me to interfere
8463656 to the very end she could not make anyone accept her my mother my family or the town
8463657 but let me tell you this kaim my mother and my relatives and the others their way of looking at things is not completely crazy to live in peace and quiet in the country you have to follow the countrys special rules it just so happens that one of those rules was not to accept a bride like myna i was born and raised in that village and i know the village code know it all too well which is why i have been in such pain all these months im a weakling i suppose in your eyes im probably so weak you want to spit on me so laugh at me hit me despise me if you want to come on hit me again
8463658 myna should have been with you thats what i think if she had married you and not some weakling like me shed still be alive
8463659 why didnt you ever answer mynas letters thats all she was hoping for a letter from you
8463660 its terrible out there in the country anybody who wants to can find out who wrote letters and who got them everybody out there is like family everybody but myna that is
8463661 you knew how trapped she was feeling you must have known how much encouragement one word from you could have given her
8463662 yes thats true but you were always the one deepest in her heart i knew that and because i knew it there was only one thing i could do
8463663 i wrote to her i pretended i was you and i wrote her letter after letter be strong i told her keep your spirits up ill come to see you soon youre too strong kaim so you cant understand the feelings of weak people but i dont have that problem im weak i understood how a weakling like myna felt
8463664 there is one thing i dont know though kaim i dont know whether myna actually believed that the letters i wrote were from you or whether she knew what i was doing and pretended to believe i wonder was life in my village so painful to her that she couldnt go on living there without pretending to believe
8463665 there was one letter just one that i didnt send to you that was three months ago it was the first letter in which myna begged you for help she said she wanted to run away and asked you to come and save her as soon as possible to rescue her and the baby
8463666 what an idiot i was be strong such words might have meant something to somebody like you but to burden a weak person like myna with them no they could only break and crush her
8463667 so hit me i dont give a damn hit me all you want beat the hell out of me but let me ask you this kaim if i had sent her last letter to you would you have finally answered that one would you have been able to accept myna in all her weakness
8463668 i am going to raise that boy of mine ill make him into a man of my village i may have been too weak to be a husband but as a father ill do better ill make him happy
8463669 hillary nos disse isto claramente que far tudo para que obama seja eleito e eu tamb m
8463670 barack obama est pronto para liderar os eua reconstruir o sonho americano e reconquistar a lideran a americana no mundo
8463671 tudo o que aprendi em oito anos anos de presid ncia e tudo o que ocorreu depois nos estados unidos e no mundo me convenceram de que barack obama o homem para este trabalho
8463672 juntos n s vencemos em uma campanha na qual os republicanos disseram que eu era jovem e inexperiente demais para ser o comandante em chefe isso soa familiar pois isso n o funcionou em 1992 porque n s est vamos do lado certo da hist ria e n o vai funcionar em 2008 porque barack obama est do lado certo da hist ria
8463673 obama tem uma habilidade impressionante de inspirar as pessoas de aumentar nossas esperan as e de nos unir para um prop sito maior ele tem a intelig ncia e a curiosidade que qualquer presidente bem sucedido precisa
8463674 barack obama vai nos afastar da divis o e do medo destes ltimos oito anos para nos fazer reencontrar a unidade e a esperan a
8463675 hillary nos disse que n o h meio termo que ela ir fazer tudo o que estiver ao seu alcance para eleger barack obama ent o somos dois
8463676 hoje na verdade somos 18 milh es porque como hillary eu quero que todos que a apoiaram votem em barack obama em novembro
8463677 manterei meu completo apoio ao conselho de seguran a e a seus membros em seu incans vel tarefa de fazer com que este indispens vel rg o seja mais eficiente transparente e inclusivo
8463678 cada vez mais complexas responsabilidades do conselho de seguran a na manuten o da paz e a seguran a internacionais
8463679 isto faz com que para o conselho seja fundamental seguir estudando seus m todos de trabalho
8463680 eficiente e respons vel de cara ao crescente conjunto de desafios

8463682 tempestade pode se transformar em um furac o amanh ou na sexta feira
8463683 no entanto qualquer desvio para a esquerda da trajet ria prevista pode levar o olho do gustav para muito perto da jamaica
8463684 acabou a moleza a caatinga n o vai virar carv o e o nordeste n o vai virar deserto
8463685 a atividade toda ilegal desde a extra o de rvores nativas como a ingazeira e a angica passando pela transforma o em carv o sem licen a e por fim no transporte que utilizava notas frias
8463686 eu t assinando com muita parcim nia mas eu n o sou o respons vel
8463687 caso o governo nacional queira impor este plebiscito ilegal os cinco departamentos n o admitir o a realiza o em seus territ rios
8463688 it is a shame that the revised standards have put broadcasters revenue before our childrens health
8463689 australian children are exposed to more junk food ads than children in any other country in the world and obesity levels are rising
8463690 greater control on the use of celebrity and character endorsements is a good move forward but we would like to have seen a much bolder and braver step towards protecting our children
8463691 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8463692 the match in vadodara will feature all the probables for the test series against australia
8463693 we would like to use that time to get our best players to play in domestic cricket and prepare in the best manner possible for the very important series against australia
8463694 what we are also planning at this stage is to organise a comprehensive camp for our players ahead of that series
8463695 we are also keen to have the mohammad nissar trophy on september 15 in delhi between the domestic champions of india and pakistan too there is also the important series two tests between india a and australia a starting in bangalore on september 3 we would like to focus on these events and i dont think anything else is possible
8463696 pakistan sri lanka and south africa have confirmed for a quadrangular one day tournament in south africa while india australia or new zealand will most likely be filling in the final spot
8463697 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8463698 i move that senator barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states
8463699 it is with great pride that i announce barack obama is the democratic nominee for president of the united states by acclamation
8463700 i have been asked to inform you that senator obama accepts the nomination
8463701 you want to vote according to what is in your heart i am not going to tell you what to do you have come from different places and made a long journey
8463702 president clinton will lay out the choices that we face on foreign policy
8463703 he will talk about how barack obama has what it takes to be a strong commander in chief
8463704 nosotros recibimos un informe preliminar del gobierno de panam y entendemos que se va a preparar un nuevo informe y una vez que lo recibamos lo vamos a comentar pero no queremos comentar cada documento que surge en panam sobre este tema no creemos que eso contribuye a resolver el caso
8463705 debemos dar el primer golpe va a ser dif cil porque enfrentamos a un equipo que tiene jerarqu a internacional y la tarea es dif cil sin embargo sabemos que tenemos los argumentos suficientes como para poder doblegar a ese equipo
8463706 hay que ser agresivos desplegar un buen f tbol y concretar las ocasiones que nos propiciemos ser a fundamental y lo otro es estar muy concentrados en la parte defensiva porque un gol en contra es una diferencia que podr a pesar en un momento determinado
8463707 the cities are so clean and the people are very honest and respectful one of my daughters friends lost her wallet on the subway and it was returned to her intact
8463708 its magnetic and rides above the tracks and goes over 200 mph the seating is spacious and they serve drinks and meals
8463709 japanese homes are very small so rooms have to serve several functions
8463710 there is a kawasaki city where they make motorcycles and we visited the toyota plant in toyota city the name of the man who started the company was toyoda but they changed it to toyota because they thought it sounded better
8463711 they really listen to their workers they encourage suggestions from everyone and take them seriously if management uses their idea that worker receives a bonus
8463712 many of the students wore uniformtype outfits but some wore clothes like kids here public high schools are not free in japan families have to pay privately
8463713 the whole junior class was going to australia for two weeks to practice their english
8463714 i discussed diversity and how it improves the quality of education
8463715 i had very positive responses to my talk from many who spoke to me later they were very interested in the workings of a diverse school system because with the low birthrate there is thought being given to open immigration to japan to increase the future workforce
8463716 japan looks to the united states and canada as two countries who have always welcomed immigrants and in their view do not anticipate future workforce problems
8463717 he does have really good accuracy and fits well into the scheme of things
8463718 hes got to be doing things really good to be the leader of a mike martz offense
8463719 at the surface you have to say flat out i dont agree with your opinion
8463720 really thats what it comes down to their job is to evaluate talent in this league and make decisions who are the best players for their teams and i dont agree with it for one reason or another it ends at that
8463721 i dont think its a thing of trying to prove people wrong this is a game when all is said and done about competing against yourself and putting everything you can into it if you do anything besides that youre cheating yourself
8463722 all you know is what they tell you when youre coming into the situation
8463723 what they told me was that it was going to be a competition and thats the way i approached it
8463724 im going to prepare to play as well as i can and if thats not good enough thats not good enough
8463725 obviously if you dont play well enough you dont deserve to be on the field
8463726 playing football has its ups and downs its a new role for me so im going to take it on and do the best i can with it
8463727 j t s the starter and im the no 2 im going to continue to get ready and get prepared knowing that i am one play away im familiar with that and obviously went through it last year things can change fast im going to continue to get better and continue to prepare as if i were playing
8463728 i havent even thought about that i havent talked about that its not in my thinking right now dont know if itll come to that right now im just thinking of this new role and what i have to do and continue to just come to work
8463729 defensively we gave up some big plays and we would hope that thats not customary for us
8463730 the second was probably more disappointing because it was just a straight return
8463731 we didnt get our first hit on him until he was at the 30 yard line
8463732 i like there to be a commander in chief on the field on a particular side of the ball
8463733 we have bad news and good news tonights dinner is horse shit good news is we have plenty of it
8463734 china expresses its concerns about the latest changes in south ossetia and abkhazia
8463735 we understand the complex history and realities of south ossetia and abkhazia at the same time reflecting chinas consistent stance on such issues we hope all the parties can appropriately resolve the issue through dialogue and consultation
8463736 and we will do this nonviolently in the spirit of martin luther king and nelson mandela
8463737 just the fact that im here 40 years later is a treat for me
8463738 i didn 11 09 am on jack johnson red rocks amphitheatre
8463739 barack obama est pronto para liderar os eua reconstruir o sonho americano e reconquistar a lideran a americana no mundo
8463740 o plano 100 significa sacar do subsolo mais de 50 bilh es de p s c bicos e 2009 deve ser o ano dos investimentos pelo compromisso que temos com a empresa e com o pa s

8463750 it jams up the channels it diverts the rivers so its just too much for fish and humans
8463751 i had no money but as i flew over this and as i drove around up here it was very clear to me that somebody had to take the initiative to do what is right
8463752 let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering for he who promised is faithful
8463753 is this really for me will this really ever happen
8463754 i think ronald reagan changed the trajectory of america in a way that richard nixon did not and in a way that bill clinton did not
8463755 and now there are reports that clinton bill that is plans on skipping obamas historic speech tomorrow at invesco field
8463756 oh she didnt say that hes ready to be commander in chief
8463757 im not a racist and i resent the implication i would vote for a black man in a minute but this guy look who he hangs out with all known racists and radicals therefore i would vote for this guy if he were older and more experienced and didnt hang out with racists but i could never vote for someone with such racist affiliations
8463758 as people of faith we believe that the harsh words and offensive gestures and displays that we have witnessed should have no place in our community especially when directed at children
8463759 we all have neighbors we all have friends we have the opportunity to influence
8463760 the most important thing is that the dialogue is respectful and based on issues and to not get caught up in these emotional things that back people into a corner
8463761 roflol bet the persians the greeks the mongols and the aztecs etc were really looking up to them
8463762 old white people make great presidents and leaders look at todays america
8463763 old white people make great presidents and leaders look at todays america
8463764 if you have to choose next week between a possible category 4 hurricane hitting in the gulf or mccains vp selection which would you pick
8463765 this kind of rhetoric i think is not helpful in educating and helping the american people make a choice
8463766 you know its the most bitter and partisan campaign that ive ever observed i think its because both parties are going to their bases rather than going to the middle i regret it
8463767 lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate
8463768 this has been a joy we didnt make it but boy did we have a good time trying
8463769 supongo que en los otros pa ses no encontraron el para so de la corrupci n que hay en el ecuador
8463770 no se sabe de qu fecha pero poco a poco seguramente con la complicidad de recibir y exigir chantajes de muchos funcionarios del ecuador resulta que esta empresa tiene ramificaciones muy amplias en el pa s
8463771 por eso es que cuando el presidente les advirti que iban a perder todo es que se dieron cuenta lo que les dijo personalmente tienen que entender que se acab
8463772 el problema estuvo en que el gobierno de sixto dur n ball n cambian las normas de la contrataci n p blica y quieren privatizarlo todo y privatizan al sector energ tico y se cambia la ley del sector el ctrico y se permite hacer concesiones y este es uno de esos contratos en el que se da una concesi n a esta empresa
8463773 firm un contrato el stico que lo fueron estirando sin que se llegara a romper
8463774 ese el stico fue creciendo y en la poca de lucio guti rrez estaba m s flexo que nunca y entonces ese contrato tiene 10 adedums agregados para cambiar varias cosas y recibir hasta llegado el caso a 100 millones de d lares m s
8463775 estas cosas no se ponen con escritura p blica sino que no aparecen los documentos
8463776 no tiene que preocuparse si la obra la hacen bien o mal
8463777 ahora cuando se suspendi el servicio se evacuaron las aguas se pudo hacer una inspecci n en los t neles y se descubri que no estaba todo cubierto de hormig n ahora lo est n recubriendo
8463778 tienen que pagar un lucro cesantes que est fijado en 200 mil d lares diarios desde el d a que se da 6 de junio hasta el d a que entreguen la planta reparada que ellos de acuerdo a un cronograma han establecido que ser hasta el 4 de octubre
8463779 pero adem s del precio que ellos dieron dijeron que tienen que hacer un reajuste de precios por los dos a os y cobraron 17 millones de d lares por reajuste de precio
8463780 odebrecht se queda con el 20 de las acciones adem s financi el estado ecuatoriano ellos solo construyeron y por iniciativa de todo este proceso se quedan con el 20 de las acciones despu s se las venden al estado ecuatoriano y lo m s sarc stico es que la obra se contrata en d lares ellos que su financiamiento es en reales brasileros entonces tienen que cobrar un diferencial bancario por cambio monetario de reales a d lares nosotros tenemos que pagar las variaciones de ese diferencial cambiario y son casi unos 20 millones
8463781 estamos esperando discutir y negociar pero ya cuando se dieron cuenta de que la cosa estaba e serio sobre todo a ra z de una reuni n que hubo en la presidencia de la rep blica la cual dio cuanta el presidente
8463782 el tema est politizado ya entonces es complicado establecer exactamente d nde est la verdad pero yo pienso y lo he manifestado as que el aula magna de la cat lica contrario a lo que se diga a veces en m poca al menos diez a os de rector a donde fueron pol ticos etc no fueron ni barras ni se la prest para fines de temas pol ticos
8463783 es una cadena que est reiterada todos los s bados se sabe c mo es la cadena por lo tanto esa cadena no es acad mica es pol tica y pienso que no se debi prestar el aula magna para ese tipo de actos
8463784 pero comenzando por all pienso que no se debi haber hecho este acto ah eso primero
8463785 si la inteligencia policial o militar detect previamente que podr an haber incidentes entonces ten an que haberle mandado una comunicaci n al rector dici ndole en prevenci n de incidentes pedimos a usted que un cuerpo policial vaya a la universidad y entonces podr an haber mandado porque la polic a sabe hacer muy bien las cosas cuando quiere hacerlo
8463786 la inteligencia deb a haberle dicho al presidente de la rep blica va a haber tal cosa o va a haber tal otra cosa vaya en estas condiciones hay que preservar la situaci n del presidente de la rep blica
8463787 la polic a en mi opini n no ha estado organizada para un acto acad mico la polic a ha ido ah ya a ver o la mandaron ya porque sab an que iba a pasar algo o fue ya cuando estaba armada media gresca all y estaba a dos cuadras de distancia pero el presidente de la rep blica sale del aula magna y baja sale de la universidad por la v a de subida que solo es de subida es decir la polic a no saca al presidente por la v a normal de salida sino que lo saca en medio de todo el bullicio y de todo lo que pasaba entonces el presidente sale como corriendo de la universidad cat lica y est n en las fotos y los videos diciendo que hay una manta blindada esa manta que cubre a veces que yo dec a el d a que me la tiren encima me mata la manta porque me rompe la columna
8463788 aqu de lo que se trata es de lo siguiente yo soy universitario de toda la vida la izquierda ecuatoriana ha hecho las manifestaciones en contra de los presidentes a donde estos presidentes se encuentren lo que pasa es que ahora como que la tortilla se ha virado debido a que en este caso quienes protestan son del sector de la derecha pol tica ecuatoriana y entonces hay que ponerle nombre y apellido a cada delincuente porque ah hab an montones de personas decenas de decenas de personas seg n los videos entonces escogen nombres bonitos como para carg rselos encima
8463789 yo creo que todo esto desprestigia a nuestro pa s porque no se busca la verdad tenemos que buscar la verdad en cada caso y en cada momento de nuestra vida
8463790 como se ha polarizado tanto la situaci n yo creo que esto va a quedar el fiscal puede levantar juicios etc etc todos hemos sido universitarios todos hemos sido en una u otra forma m s rebeldes y sabemos muy bien que cuando un muchacho de veinte a os le dicen tal cosa contesta con otra igual entonces aqu la universidad cat lica hoy d a leo preocupado que dice que ha habido gente con manopla que ha perseguido etc etc entonces el tema se va agrandando en lugar de buscar la verdad se va buscado culpables en cada grupo
8463791 lo nico que rescato es que los universitarios por fin ahora han dicho aqu estamos porque hace tiempo que estaban dormidos y no hab a una presencia universitaria en el pa s como que estaban yo digo como que si les hubieran puesto una inyecci n de trancalmato
8463792 claro que hay que sancionar cuando hay que sancionar pero en este momento yo he sido presidente de la rep blica y a los dem s presidentes a todos nos han insultado cuando han querido el grupo tal o el grupo tal los que somos m s dem cratas que otros hemos pasado por alto esas situaciones pero aqu querer expulsar alumnos de la universidad a b o c yo creo que esa es la medida m s dr stica porque incluso los pone en peligro de perder sus vidas universitarias en cualquier universidad
8463793 its obvious weve hit a flat spot you know and its disappointing to see so much negative publicity about us
8463794 traders pushed the price of crude oil higher on wednesday on forecasts that tropical storm gustav will intensify into a hurricane as it ploughs toward the u s oil and natural gas platforms in the gulf of mexico whats the hurricane play
8463795 hillarys going to do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us
8463796 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8463797 everything ive done has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8463798 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8463799 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8463800 too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8463801 its been such a joy to take this show to so many countries that ive never been to before but its a real thrill to finally be bringing it home to australia and to be able to share it with you all

8463837 i just think its helpful to recognize the magnitude of these funds and their long investment horizons

8463845 catholic christian and buddhist groups are trying to overcome the situation if there is no change in the governments stance we will consider issuing a statement signed by the leaders of seven groups representing seven different denominations
8463846 so far the government and the organizers of the candlelight rallies have only told their side of the story but it seems there has not been much chance for the two sides to meet and talk with each other the most urgent thing is dialogue
8463847 as the government has no channel for talks with the rally organizers im asking some people to hold talks to open a channel for discussion i think the organization leaders who are in detention need to be treated with leniency
8463848 nonsense because police have already arrested some of the activists from the council
8463849 government officials who have to function as public servants have carried out the activities of missionaries or forced people to believe in their religion by exploiting their official posts these are unpatriotic acts that undermine national harmony split public sentiment and trigger disputes among different religions we will deal sternly with government officials who have been partial to a certain religion to keep the principle of separation of church and state which is clarified by constitutional law article no 20

8463853 we arent certain that weve lost all those employees they may be changing jobs i think that there are some very highly skilled people at harkers who have been there for a number of years and we certainly hope and anticipate that a number of them will be absorbed into the workforce here in le mars

8463863 the comparison of canadas prime minister to nazi leader adolf hitler is obscene and offensive
8463864 such statements trivialize the holocaust and inject ugly rhetoric in what ought to be reasoned debate on real and pressing political issues
8463865 as we move closer to what appears to be a fall election we call for political campaigns that are free from bigotry and prejudice we urge politicians and citizens alike to engage in meaningful dialogue that addresses the concerns of the electorate and moves towards practical solutions

8463879 en este caso en particular hemos recibido a la corte suprema a su presidente y a unos pocos magistrados m s para conocer de cerca para que el consejo de c mara les d un espacio de consulta y opini n y adem s tener los argumentos de juicio para saber qu es lo que est pasando respecto a un tema que nos preocupa much simo el referente a la seguridad jur dica
8463880 los emprendedores del pa s hemos sido v ctimas de la inseguridad jur dica porque cuando aquella esta persistente en el escenario pol tico o p blico las inversiones decrecen y esto implica decrecimiento de nuevos emprendimientos y sobre todo un decrecimiento en la generaci n de nuevas plazas de trabajo
8463881 el conocer de la gente experta en la administraci n de justicia de c mo ven ellos las cosas la preocupaci n que tiene con respecto al r gimen de transici n y al hecho de que puedan ser cesados miembros de la corte inclusive aquello que se denomina la t mbola el sorteo es decir hemos auscultado su preocupaci n en referencia a la justicia en el pa s a nosotros nos preocupa supremamente el tema porque si no hay seguridad jur dica si la cosas no van claras las inversiones decrecen la econom a se ve afectada
8463882 que es importante clarificar si va o no el r gimen de transici n dentro del texto constitucional que va a ser consultado al pueblo el pr ximo 28 de septiembre por eso hacemos ese tipo de acciones en democracia
8463883 si ese proceso se hallan porque los se ores isa as paguen en una negociaci n transparente a la luz p blica yo no me opongo
8463884 nosotros como mpd estamos en una intensa campa a por el s creemos que el proceso constitucional es la culminaci n de d cadas de lucha del movimiento se est n recogiendo en la nueva constituci n pr cticamente las banderas del movimiento estudiantil de los trabajadores y hoy estamos a punto de tener una constituci n que recupera derechos soberan a y desde ese punto de vista somos parte y protagonistas de ese cambio
8463885 somos optimistas estamos recorriendo el pa s y entendemos que el pueblo ecuatoriano en el ltimo proceso ha ido encontrando un anhelo de cambio que se va clarificando este pueblo es bien especial en esos a os de democracia representativa ning n presidente ha podido repetirse ning n partido ha sido la mayor fuerza pol tica en una elecci n el pueblo siempre ha estado buscando el cambio
8463886 cuando a la gente le decimos que el neoliberalismo durante 30 a os hizo que la educaci n sea excluyente la universidad sea pagada m s de 8 mil escuelas cerradas la gente ve el ayer y ahora le decimos que se va a duplicar el presupuesto de educaci n si le decimos que la universidad va a ser gratuita y que tendr n acceso los hijos del pueblo son razones que la gente entiende directamente
8463887 j venes maestros campesinos trabajadores informales que han sido en el pasado perseguidos son sectores que quieren el cambio tradicionalmente el pueblo ecuatoriano no quiere que regrese el pasado y quiz s esa es la mayor fortaleza del s plantearnos que en la nueva constituci n haya un futuro
8463888 este pa s est polarizado hace rato es uno de los pa ses mas injustos de am rica latina cuando hay una mayor a que est fuera de la riqueza que no tiene acceso a educaci n salud a trabajo y una minor a que vive del trabajo ajeno que se hace millonaria a costa de la riqueza nacional evidentemente hay una polarizaci n ahora lo que ocurre es que esa mayor a est tomando conciencia de cambiar las cosas
8463889 estar a preocupado si las c maras estuvieran aplaudiendo la constituci n
8463890 estar a preocupado si el partido de jamil maguad la udc estuviera apoyando la constituci n pero me alegra mucho que estos sectores que han estado acostumbrados a no pagar impuestos a tercerizar a los trabajadores tienen que buscar defender sus privilegios
8463891 ahora se habla no solamente de fortalecer el estado y gobierno muchas de las pol ticas sino que se establece un estamento hay todo un titulo que se llama participaci n social y ciudadana en donde se establece la obligatoriedad a los sectores populares que adem s se garantiza su capacidad de autorganizarse de participar en la planificaci n en el control popular de la constituci n entonces el pueblo va a ser protagonista

8463916 if you were a plant what would be in your grocery shopping cart
8463917 if the route is supposed to be at 20 yards and they are all at 20 yards it doesnt make any difference who runs it its just developing that trust and knowing that that guy is going to do what he is supposed to do
8463918 its a trust thing where they trust me to put the ball where im supposed to and i trust them to be where they need to be
8463919 but its not an evaluation process like oh is he open whos out there or lets see how long it takes him to get it its this play to that coverage the ball goes there immediately he better be there and i better put it right there
8463920 those guys have to do things exactly as they are coached to do it it doesnt change for me depending on who is out there or what the situation is in the game or what group you are with those guys have to be in the same spots as everybody else its just a matter of doing it with those guys
8463921 its very necessary to have those guys out there weve been behind the eight ball and thats hurt us we need that desperately that will affect us im concerned about it weve had them out here a few days bj in particular has been real good we need to get them in that environment as much as we can to their credit theyve stayed in it they dont make mental errors but just the connection between the quarterback and the receivers is real important
8463922 when you do the game plan and create things for these guys you want to see if they can make a play and make the most out of something
8463923 ok bj here you go what do you do with that
8463924 its hard with josh because hes a rookie and hes never been the tempo of a regular vs preseason game is substantially different
8463925 to play under that pressure all of the sudden the lights are shining the timing isnt like it was in the preseason because you are a little panicky and theres that growth process you are trying to fight through so to say that josh is the guy who is going to start hes in it obviously but we are really kind of planning on bj to step up and be healthy and get ready to go
8463926 in detroit he did a real nice job for us as a backup but what hes done so far is to take an opportunity and made the most of it to say that i expected him to be this good id be lying i didnt know that i thought he had a chance to be a pretty good player but hes taken the opportunity ran with it and excelled
8463927 i dont think there isnt anything he cant do i havent seen it yet i would say we are very pleased and hes kind of what we thought he would be and more he does not make mental errors hes in good shape although it was a preseason game last week im really pleased with running his vision his cuts hes really ready to play hes ready to go and hes the kind of player you build an offense around
8463928 the thing that allows us to excel offensively is all based on our offensive line
8463929 that goes back to sacks protection the ability to run the ball well everything is predicated on how well they do theyve really made remarkable progress from the first week of camp to where they are now
8463930 i dont have a preconceived notion of where we should be i just wouldnt put a limit of it
8463931 im excited about this group its a talented group with great character they are very unselfish and their work ethic is really good so there is really probably nothing they cant accomplish they just dont know that yet i wouldnt put a limit or a ceiling on it
8463932 first of all let me tell you this lets get this straight there is nothing fair about this league
8463933 if you establish yourself as an incredible player within the quarterback game then thats just the way it goes so understand that
8463934 it really isnt so much about alex but j t s performances have been so unusual i think alex is fine he hasnt done anything to discredit him as a starter or to say that he cant play thats not been the issue at all we had an opportunity to give these guys a day off with their arm and j t stepped in and did some remarkable things so we decided to take more of a look at him the more we gave him the better he did
8463935 obviously the first group of players playing will be important to get the timing and the chemistry all down between the players in the case of the twos and the threes theyre guys trying to make the squad so it will be important for them to play well we have about five guys that will not play in the game ill let aaron salkin give you the five names after hell give them to you
8463936 it will be between bryant johnson and ashley lelie bryant johnson if hes well looks like he was able to go today pretty good so itll be nice to see him and at the other position it will be isaac bruce and arnaz battle three wide receivers obviously all three receivers will be in the game at the same time
8463937 josh morgan is still ill he will not play in the game
8463938 like i said about everybody that plays this weekend you know we havent seen bryant johnson nor have we seen ashley lelie for the entire preseason so far so ill be anxious to see how they do in the game josh morgan although a rookie and although it was two preseason games he played in last weeks game although he didnt do very much so i guess he didnt play in three preseason games but anyhow he did a very good job itll be good problem if its a tough decision to be honest with you because it means that we have more than one guy all of those guys will be called upon to contribute first game to seeing as if they dont make the roster im sure they do but i would hope that they contribute who starts well have to wait and see on that one
8463939 yes those guys havent played much so a quarter if not a half i hope to see more of them some of the reps will depend on them if they start to feel it tightening up or whatever they absolutely wont get as much i hope that does not occur because just liked we talked about we want to get in that first season game with that healthy group
8463940 we did put a lot of emphasis these practices this week we went good against good the entire week which is not typical for this week so we got a lot of good work and that was exactly what you guys were talking about j t osullivan got a lot of work with those guys that you were talking about in practice even though it maybe limited in the game like i said we tried to get in three days here this week as opposed to one game and i thought that was more important
8463941 well theyre very similar to us today was more of san diego than the other two days were but our offense will identify from a scheme standpoint
8463942 i like the way it is to be honest with you but if they change it id like that too id imagine i dont have much of a choice but as it is i like it because you have to prepare your football team number one and youve got to evaluate a bunch of guys that you want to see if they are going to make you better or not and if its too tight of a time frame then i dont know how you are really going to evaluate those guys because now youve got three games whats more important getting your guys ready or seeing who can beat somebody out at least with four games you can try to accomplish both if im making any sense with three games you have to say id rather get my team ready than try to figure out if youre going to be part of the team but every year theres somebody that shows up that wouldnt our training camp this one is a great example how many reps would josh morgan have gotten had those other guys all been healthy i dont know maybe hed have been a fence player hes obviously hes in pretty good standing with what he did in those games but i dont know if i would have seen that like i said that is why i like the four games but if they do the three then everybody would have the same issues and well go from there
8463943 thats probably the toughest i think most guys would tell you thats probably one of the more difficult things in doing it but i know from personal experience i did try out i did get cut there are better things afterwards and it may not be in football sometimes it is the better our football team gets some of the guys we let go still are playing so its not like im severing off someones dream thats usually kind of where it gets you on the human side but like i said youve got to do those things because it is part of the job and the most important to me are obviously the 53 that make our roster and the practice squad guys so ive got to do whats necessary to make this one of the best teams but its difficult i dont think anyone in the game would tell you its not it would be hard to be a good coach if the guys didnt see that you loved them at some point maybe on that day but at least leading up to it theyd like to think that you cared about them
8463944 all the home games theyve approved it for the road games but i cant wear the coat i have to wear reebok over the top but im not sure i think ill just wear it for home games
8463945 they thought i was too young and experienced to lead a country

8464005 the injury wasnt affected by the period of extra time when he went away with
8464006 he was playing with pain before and he kept going today because he knew he was going to see the surgeon tomorrow its not serious its a minor operation but we needed to do it
8464007 we knew it would be difficult because they played well in the first game and we had to work really hard until the end for me the most positive thing is we played a little bit better against a good team who are sharp now we scored right at the end that showed the team was working really hard
8464008 when you play these kind of games the other team is playing and training just thinking about this game
8464009 we are the veterans the iraq war veterans the anti war veterans
8464010 i just cant imagine driving through my neighborhood at home and seeing a security checkpoint
8464011 i definitely support the protest i have a lot of friends in iraq
8464012 it was scary at first but theyre just marching theyre trying to be americans i guess
8464013 i was part of vietnam and that was a hoax this iraq expletive is even worse
8464014 we need to vote with our feet in the street and make our message loud enough for the whole world to hear
8464015 we want our troops home now we want them taken care of when they get here the america i know would not torture anybody
8464016 h uma grande probabilidade que a tempestade ser de categoria 3 ao entrar no golfo ela ter potencial para se tornar uma tempestade de categoria 4 ou 5 depois
8464017 felizmente temos uma revolu o est garantido que ningu m ser esquecido se vidas forem perdidas n o ser o centenas ou milhares
8464018 you can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure you learn about the strength of his mind but even more importantly you learn about the quality of his heart
8464019 i watched how he touched people how he inspired them and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8464020 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8464021 now after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home john mccain was wrong barack obama was right
8464022 champ when you get knocked down get up get up
8464023 my mothers creed is the american creed no one is better than you
8464024 for those of us who grew up in middle class neighborhoods like scranton and wilmington that was the american dream and we knew it
8464025 no financial incentive for fidelity to promote auction rate securities as opposed to other short term investments
8464026 we know that times are rough and parents still have to buy these items because they are on teachers lists
8464027 it has become more important to compare prices because of the economy
8464028 were hoping for a gain in business once we can get on peoples radar screens and they can see that we have everything on their back to school lists not just our hot buys
8464029 you give that heifer the pick ed end of the stick and shell move
8464030 are you kidding talk about being for it before youre against it
8464031 to those who still believe in the myth of a maverick instead of the reality of a politician i say lets compare to candidate mccain
8464032 let me tell you before he ever debates should finish the debate with himself
8464033 to talk to our enemies and consult with our allies
8464034 thats why we are here and we are proud to stand with him as he leads the fight for a smarter and tougher foreign policy so that we can finally end the go after the terrorists who attacked us on 9 11 and defeat them where they are strongest in
8464035 this is a guy who lives in my neighborhood hes not somebody who i exchange ideas from on a regular basis
8464036 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barrack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
8464037 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8464038 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8464039 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8464040 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8464041 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8464058 instead of rushing headlong into an expensive prison building programme the government must focus on addressing the causes of the growing prison population
8464059 building bigger prisons will achieve nothing clearly the government are looking to build titan prisons based on a need to save money
8464060 titan prison complexes will be the most effective way of providing value for money and reducing reoffending

8464087 when you pray for courage god doesnt give you courage but the opportunity to be courageous when you pray for love god doesnt give you love but the opportunity to be loved and to love another
8464088 we categorically deny that the sudan liberation movement has carried out the hijacking we condemn any act that causes harm to any sudanese civilian
8464089 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
8464090 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
8464091 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
8464092 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
8464093 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
8464094 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
8464095 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
8464096 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
8464097 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
8464098 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
8464099 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
8464100 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
8464101 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
8464102 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
8464103 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
8464104 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
8464105 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
8464106 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
8464107 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
8464108 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
8464109 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
8464110 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
8464111 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
8464112 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
8464113 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
8464114 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
8464115 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
8464116 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
8464117 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
8464118 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
8464119 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
8464120 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
8464121 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
8464122 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
8464123 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
8464124 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
8464125 this chance encounter with a total stranger almost two decades after my fathers death has changed everything
8464126 ive felt the injury on and off for 16 months sometimes more sometimes less its something ive had to cope with
8464127 the staff and i have worked very hard so that im fit and when i play i dont miss out
8464128 theyve done a really good job i think weve got it under control
8464129 hopefully ill be back soon and fit for the remainder of the season im improving every day
8464130 i want to win i remember the last time we went there i only played half a team because we had a monday league game against newcastle
8464131 when i saw lazio celebrating at the end it was like they had won the
8464132 well view the super cup as a one off and we want to win it but we are expecting a very tough game
8464133 because it seemed interesting but mainly because i work with the guy and i thought id throw him a bone months ago while attending a funeral steve and i spoke at length about the book writing process and the soon to be published book topic turtles and science
8464134 you cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong you cannot help the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer you cannot help the poor by destroying the rich you cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they could and should do for themselves
8464135 lcd monitor to switcher box using dvi then to g4 via dvi works
8464136 weve been coming closer together and hanging out outside of football
8464137 i think thats making us a tighter group when it comes to game situations when a play breaks down or something like that we can look side to side at each other and know that were all in it together it really helps the chemistry and helps us get going
8464138 were talking a lot and letting each other know certain calls
8464139 were calling out the fronts were talking a lot better up front than we were last year it just seemed like last year we were all in there as individuals
8464140 we all knew our jobs and we all knew what we were doing but maybe one time someone didnt know what they were doing and they missed their block or they missed their guy and then the play would just crumble this year were all calling out what we have were all on the same page and we all know what we have to do
8464141 i think that we could have made the adjustments but we came out in the second half and had three turnovers back to back we never really got going offensively
8464142 when it came to buchtel we practiced against two or three different fronts all week
8464143 we were pretty much ready for anything we had a couple of plays we had changed up just for the buchtel game we got it done after halftime we were able to run the ball
8464144 it always is scary early in the year because you dont do any live special teams in the scrimmages
8464145 and then you have to go out there and now you have to cover seven kickoffs and three or four punts and theyve never done it before we were fairly pleased for the first day theres a lot of room for improvement obviously well go from where were at
8464146 last year at the end of the year that was probably the biggest question mark
8464147 steve schott graduates and we really didnt have a junior varsity kicker those two guys made a sacrifice from the soccer team and was just sort of walking the hallways talking to me and some other coaches but they made a sacrifice that they were interested in kicking
8464148 when you go out for the first game in front of 8 or 9 000 people you never know what youre going to get were really happy with their performance we think through experience theyre only going to get better
8464149 our punting besides the one that went off mikes foot was pretty good
8464150 he kicked 65 yards after that safety in the air thats pretty impressive the thing i told mike is hes playing quarterback and he took a sack and then went to punt hes got to be able to play the next play put that play behind you because we need you to punt 50 yards were going to keep working on that
8464151 a lot of the cover guys we had last year are back so that helps a ton just in the fact that theyre experienced in it
8464152 the first couple of games are always tough because its hot and usually theres always got to be some substitutions and what not
8464153 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything in her power to elect barack obama
8464154 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us
8464155 with eyes firmly fixed on the future and in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together with one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8464156 the deficit funding of the public health sector has to stop
8464157 i dont want to be too critical of people who draft my speeches but i get a lot of speeches in draft that i never use
8464158 im not a racist and i resent the implication i would vote for a black man in a minute but this guy look who he hangs out with all known racists and radicals therefore i would vote for this guy if he were older and more experienced and didnt hang out with racists but i could never vote for someone with such racist affiliations

8464162 democrats saw the south as unwinnable and republicans viewed the south as a base
8464163 if he revives some economic populism and takes after the big corporations that could help too
8464164 everybody comes together to support you so you can take down the last boss
8464165 im still upset you got horned shoulder armor you knew that was my thing
8464166 ooh were on the ds so we have to use the touchscreen and stylus
8464167 we must determine whether russias intervention against its georgian neighbours is an exceptionally brutal and extreme response or it is moscows new tougher attitude towards its neighbours and the entire world community
8464168 may become catastrophic if it is the start of another cold war
8464169 additional security steps only in direct proximity to south ossetia but not in any other part of georgia
8464170 the showers a classic you can see my bum and a little of my breast perfect for the american censors
8464171 on a spring day in 1945 he helped liberate one of the concentration camps at buchenwald
8464172 ladies and gentleman barack obamas great uncle is here with us tonight please join me in saluting this american hero charlie payne charlie your nephew barack obama will end this politics of distortion and division he will be a president who seeks not to perfect the lies of swift boating but to end them once and for all
8464173 we have to make less mistakes on special teams that would help out on defense we still have trouble giving up the big play and we have to become more physical
8464174 offensively were just not very consistent right now last week we didnt block at a very high percentage and when we tried to throw the ball there was pressure on us
8464175 theres a lot of things that we have get better at and if we dont get better at them then i dont know how were going to expect to compete but we will get better at those positions were going to get better and thats what were going to keep working toward
8464176 im sure inexperience didnt help us any but im not going to sit there and use inexperience the whole year i know that
8464177 there comes a point where we have to quit saying were inexperienced and we have to get ready to play right now we have to make some good things happen for our football team we havent done that yet but somewhere along the line if we want to make any inroads this year were going to have to start making some plays
8464178 im sure that not only was inexperience a factor in that game but we had a lot of kids banged up and not healthy for that game
8464179 we had to start a lot of sophomores and its tough for a sophomore to be thrown into that situation
8464180 i thought new philly came out and they were very physical and very aggressive and that kind of shocked our guys a little bit we didnt do very well with it at the outset but we kind of regrouped and did better in the second half
8464181 its just trying to figure out what theyre going to do offensively because i know they have some kids banged up
8464182 when those kids are coming back i dont know are they going to come out in a one back set or a two back set i dont know
8464183 thats the thing we dont know which tailback which quarterback which wide receivers we might see come friday but i do know that usually with those young kids you get players who are pretty hungry they want to do things right and they want to please their coaches so theyre going to come over here and be pretty fired up theyre going to play hard which we know for a fact
8464184 we did play a good third quarter although i think maybe new philly might have had a bit of a letdown
8464185 we made them punt three times took the ball away from them and outgained them in the third quarter
8464186 those times when youre looking at your bank account and you aint got much money
8464187 but at the same time i dont regret it at all because that time will still come ill still be able to do what i want to do as far as the financial end goes im just having the time of my life right now every time i think of something i could be doing right now in the nfl i think of the enjoyable time im having here
8464188 with all of the relationships ive had and being selected captain i guess losing two national championship games that kind of motivates you a little bit also
8464189 i get asked that a lot by friends do you ever regret your decision
8464190 i havent looked at that once its something i knew basically going into the national title game where my heart was i knew my heart was here the only reason it took a while to kind of announce it is i wanted to be sure that i covered all my bases
8464191 its more just kind of like what fits you best
8464192 going to the nfl league is not what i wanted i wasnt ready to be an adult and i dont think ill ever be ready to be an adult
8464193 besides what would this place do without me it would probably be so serious
8464194 when you make that decision to come back you know theres always a chance that you can get hurt
8464195 you have to realize that if its meant to be its meant to be you cant play being cautious thinking man if i get hurt im going to lose money im going to lose my draft status youve got to go out there and give it your all
8464196 we have to make sure we play sound football every play
8464197 dalton is going to keep coming at you they always have great football teams and we know its going to be a battle
8464198 if we say were going to take away the pass then their quarterback and running back daniel marthey will run wild in the middle
8464199 we have to mentally prepare for a whole different look offensively then what we saw against south range
8464200 they ran a wing t offense and dalton runs more options its a different look in regards as to how they get the ball to their running back
8464201 were going into this week with a similar attack to what we saw last week wing t
8464202 this week theyll spread more with the quarterback in shotgun most of the time but theyre still going to run some power football theyre more of a run spread offense for them to beat a team like they did last week obviously theyre very good at it
8464203 if their defense shuts one of our kids down will it stifle the offense we hope not
8464204 we hope to have enough variety on offense that if they take one thing away then we hope to have something else to go to
8464205 on defense we can shut one of their players down but that doesnt mean someone else wont pick up the slack
8464206 they have a lot of weapons it doesnt mean theyre a two person team we definitely have our work cut out for us
8464207 their quarterback gavin hackett and three running backs just keep doing a great job theyre going to keep you off guard and theyre going to keep coming at you they have probably one of the bigger lines ive seen out of them since ive been here and their defense is fast they fly to the ball theyre a strong team on both sides of the ball
8464208 hi this is bob you can send me a file
8464209 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8464210 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8464211 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8464212 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8464213 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour

8464249 but im very proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children and im grateful for the chance chelsea and i had to tell americans about the person we know and love
8464250 like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8464251 clearly the job of the next president is to rebuild the american dream and restore americas standing in the world clinton said
8464252 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8464253 he has a remarkable ability to inspire people to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose he has the intelligence and curiosity every successful president needs
8464254 his policies on the economy taxes health care and energy are far superior to the republican alternatives he said
8464255 he has shown a clear grasp of our foreign policy and national security challenges and a firm commitment to repair our badly strained military
8464256 his family heritage and life experiences have given him a unique capacity to lead our increasingly diverse nation and to restore our leadership in an ever more interdependent world
8464257 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need

8464261 barack obama also will not allow the worlds problems to obscure its opportunities
8464262 these challenges cry out for american ideas and american innovation when barack obama unleashes them america will save lives win new allies open new markets and create new jobs for our people
8464263 most important barack obama knows that america cannot be strong abroad unless we are strong at home people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8464264 the republicans will nominate a good man who served our country heroically and suffered terribly in vietnam he loves our country every bit as much as we all do
8464265 as a senator he has shown his independence on several issues
8464266 they took us from record surpluses to an exploding national debt from over 22 million new jobs down to 5 million from an increase in working family incomes of 7 500 to a decline of more than 2 000 from almost 8 million americans moving out of poverty to more than 5 and a half million falling into poverty and millions more losing their health insurance
8464267 now in spite of all the evidence their candidate is promising more of the same more tax cuts for the wealthiest americans that will swell the deficit increase inequality and weaken the economy

8464269 barack obama is ready to lead america barack obama is ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8464270 barack obama knows that america cannot be strong abroad when we are not strong at home
8464271 america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8464272 they actually want us to reward them for the last 8 years by giving them four more lets say thanks but no thanks third times not the charm
8464273 sixteen years ago the republicans said i was too young and inexperienced to be commander in chief it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history

8464323 barack obama knows that america cannot be strong abroad when we are not strong at home
8464324 america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8464325 they actually want us to reward them for the last 8 years by giving them four more lets say thanks but no thanks third times not the charm
8464326 sixteen years ago the republicans said i was too young and inexperienced to be commander in chief it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8464327 before he ever talks to obama mccain should finish the debate with himself
8464328 it is the very height of insensitivity for the republican party to feature a cross at the center of the podium of this convention
8464329 this wooden cross must be at least three feet one meter tall and it sends a signal of exclusivity loudly and clearly
8464330 my god where do they come up with this stuff
8464331 does it look to you like its a cross i dont think so
8464332 i dont think ive ever used meme probably because i dont know what it means lol

8464335 more going it alone in the world instead of building shared opportunities and shared responsibilities to enhance our security
8464336 they said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it will not work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history

8464338 una scelta non facile ma lunica possibilit per salvare le vite delle persone
8464339 mediatore e pacificatore per il regolamento politico partendo dal riconoscimento dell integrit territoriale della georgia mentre la sua leadership ha scelto unaltra strada
8464340 si tratta di una evidente annessione di quei territori che sono parte della georgia
8464341 una balcanizzazione su base etnica del caucaso un pericolo serio per tutti

8464343 as a full investigation is being conducted to unearth the whole truth about this matter the executive mansion wishes to make it clear that the office of the president at no time gave license to any third party to serve as negotiator or go between and hereby wishes to establish a clear line of demarcation between the office of the president and the allegations in the purported email exchanges
8464344 the executive mansion is particularly and gravely concerned about references to her excellency as well as to other high government officials in the purported email exchanges and will leave no stone unturned to ensure that the truth is unveiled and the perpetrators prosecuted in keeping with the laws of liberia
8464345 matter has also been brought to the attention of the u s state department the government of liberia has solicited the support of the department in getting to the bottom of the matter
8464346 the government believes this action o be necessary so that the agreement is in no way perceived to be tainted
8464347 if the emails are authenticated by the various investigations including those which the government of liberia will be requesting of the government of the united states the responsible persons and any persons adjudged to have committed violations of the laws of liberia will be fully prosecuted
8464348 if the results of the investigations show that this was part of a scheme that the emails were doctored and that they were initiated by persons seeking to defame the government and impeded the development strides it is making appropriate legal and other actions will be taken against them
8464349 an investigation sponsored by and under the auspices of the government of liberia under the prevailing circumstances would not be credible and would only be a travesty of justice

8464351 lots of kids may talk about it but talking about cosmetic surgery is a long way from actually going and having it done yourself
8464352 it is the bullies who have the problems not the victims they should not have to change their appearance to stop bullying
8464353 a child does not need invasive surgery to tackle bullying
8464354 if this happened in the workplace there would be laws against them schools need to take it far more seriously
8464355 we completely understand that people feel so severely bullied and destitute that they are unable to deal with what has happened to them

8464357 why didnt we see that hillary all during the campaign
8464358 general system error occured the system returne an error communication with the virtua machine may have been interrupted
8464359 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8464360 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8464361 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8464362 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8464363 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8464364 everything ive seen has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job

8464371 la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori
8464372 grazie al loro impegno alla dedizione dei giovani ed alla certezza delle posizioni tenute dal partito
8464373 che lunione di centro ha potuto riscuoter consensi senza rimaner schiacciata fra le due grandi coalizioni elettorali pdl lega e pd idv mantenendo quindi una significativa rappresentanza parlamentare la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori siamo consci che nel periodo in cui viviamo i veti pregiudiziali e lostruzionismo allazione di governo siano deleteri per un paese che cerca di risollevarsi testimonianza ne la presenza in aula dei nostri parlamentari a garanzia del numero legale per un corretto svolgimento dei lavori di contro votar a scatola chiusa i disegni di legge presentati significherebbe allinearsi su posizioni che non ci appartengono e sulle quali nutriamo forti perplessit

8464375 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8464376 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8464377 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato

8464412 pensamos que a principios del a o que viene estar a terminado por lo menos la parte de edificios y de ah en m s comenzar a desarrollar todo lo que va a ser el parque tem tico la idea nuestra es que el que visite santa ana lo viva con todas las actividades que le va a ofrecer el parque estamos trabajando adem s para poder insertarnos con lo local del municipio dulces artesan as y todo lo que pueda ser la puesta en valor para eso se han desarrollado estrategias que tienen que ver por ejemplo con un taller de artes que tiene m s de cien alumnos donde se hacen cer micas pintura en piedra recreaciones de t cnicas guaran es y tambi n logramos una tecnicatura en este caso con la facultad de artes de ober donde el eje tem tico de la producci n va a ser la de envases precisamente para los dulces regionales para las hierbas medicinales que estamos trabajando la idea es que salga terminado el producto en santa ana
8464413 estamos trabajando con la l nea hort cola de hecho hay veinticinco familias vendiendo en las distintas ferias de posadas trabajamos con las hierbas medicinales con la cal ndula en principio pero la idea es sumar m s

8464416 during the arrest one of the officers can be heard saying to eslocker youre lucky i didnt knock the f
8464417 i dont know how you make a record on liberal and conservative these days weve had a conservative republican congress so to speak and a conservative president and weve run up one of the most astounding deficits in the history of our nation
8464418 if you could have the retrofit option it could revolutionise plans under way now it would be great for those looking at having to throw out their outdated fireplaces
8464419 really youre focused youre listening and getting a feel for the hall you havent been there you dont quite have that same feel as if youd been there for a few hours even
8464420 those trees were mature and in danger of being blown over destabilising the ground they were planted to protect
8464421 the issue is that we still have the remainder of the debt to pay and many high priority projects that really need attention
8464422 it would make us a safer long term asset for the region
8464423 weve got to be able to consolidate and get to a place so we are here for the long haul
8464424 its not the gun that makes the player its the player that makes the player
8464425 im going to get the kids now i know youve still got a headache do you want me to drop some medicine by or just pick you up
8464426 ill be fine ill probably have you pick me up in an hour or so
8464427 its been half an hour do you want me to just come by the store and wait
8464428 if you drink beer you can get drunk if you get drunk you turn into a bad guy
8464429 trevor mom doesnt get drunk mommys feeling bad and a drink or two might make it feel better youll know more when you get older beer isnt bad how people use it can be bad
8464430 the notion that woman who are passionate supporters of hillary clintons would honor her by voting for john mccain seems to me to be totally insane
8464431 it keeps being raised as real but i havent ever found anybody that can confirm that im absolutely convinced tht 99 9 percent of the people who supported hillary clinton will support barack obama all the things she fought for will only be achieved if barack is president
8464432 how do people even identify who are hillary clinton supporters in those polls
8464433 i was a hillary clinton supporter now i support john mccain
8464434 now customers are not necessarily coming to us to save costs but more for value
8464435 firms are tightening costs with smaller salary hikes and radically cutting recruitment
8464436 the indian eso industry will evolve from its current product portfolio and slowly but surely graduate to be the design services hub of the world
8464437 what the industry went through with information technology in terms of outsourcing 20 years ago engineering is going through today
8464438 iya padahal gw ngambil ini ga tau syapa aja yang ngambil
8464439 ehehe iya sama chindi jg ga tau syapa aja yang ngambil

8464448 vamos a estar m s r pidos y a ganar este pleito aunque tenga que perseguirlo por todo el cuadril tero
8464449 yo no creo que calder n vaya a correr ya yo pienso que va a volar porque ya no puede correr m s
8464450 mi estilo no es correr es un boxeo fino y el que va a volar es l pero sin t tulo
8464451 todos saben que yo vengo a pelear a dar guerra y si l benavides quiere guerra pues guerra le voy a dar
8464452 vengo bien preparado para dar un buen espect culo y que el p blico salga satisfecho
8464453 im really not at all interested in whats going on inside the convention center its a bunch of people saying feel good platitudes to get themselves elected all studiously avoiding saying anything substantial that might annoy a voter
8464454 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8464455 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8464456 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8464457 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8464458 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8464459 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8464460 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8464461 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8464462 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8464463 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8464464 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8464465 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8464466 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8464467 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8464468 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8464469 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8464470 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8464471 annullare la capacit militare nucleare della russia dopo il crollo sovietico che invece rimasta intatta anche a costo di grossi sacrifici economici e che ora la garanzia della nuova politica aggressiva per ricostruire il passato potere
8464472 avremmo sparato a obama da grande distanza circa 750 metri usando un fucile
8464473 barack una persona come tutte le altre ha ripetuto pi volte michelle nelle interviste pre convention viene dalla classe media e riuscito a fare il college solo grazie alle borse di studio i suoi problemi sono quelli di tutti i genitori americani vuole un avvenire migliore per le nostre figlie
8464474 un uomo integro capace di trascinare lamerica e di restituire speranza
8464475 io e barack siamo stati educati con gli stessi valori ha ricordato che devi lavorare sodo per ottenere ci che vuoi nella vita che la parola data un vincolo che se prometti qualcosa lo dovrai mantenere e che devi trattare ogni persona con dignit e rispetto anche se non sei daccordo con loro
8464476 e rimasto lo stesso uomo di cui mi innamorai 19 anni fa luomo che quando mi ha portato a casa dallospedale insieme alla nostra prima figlia guidava a passo di lumaca guardando con ansia nello specchietto retrovisore sentendo per intero il peso del nostro futuro nelle sue mani e deciso a dare alla nostra bimba tutto ci per cui aveva lottato e quello che lui non aveva mai avuto labbraccio rassicurante di un padre
8464477 e grazie alla forza di volont e alla determinazione di uomini cos ha aggiunto alludendo al padre e al marito che questa settimana possiamo celebrare due anniversari gli 88 anni del diritto di voto alle donne e i 45 del discorso di martin luther king che ci ispir con il suo sogno
8464478 una nuova stagione di speranza speranza per molti non solo pi per pochi
8464479 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8464480 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8464481 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8464482 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8464483 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8464484 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8464485 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8464486 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8464487 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8464488 no one works for someone we all just work together
8464489 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8464490 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8464491 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8464492 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8464493 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8464494 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8464495 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8464496 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8464497 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8464498 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8464499 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8464500 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8464501 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8464502 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8464503 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8464504 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8464505 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8464506 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8464507 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8464508 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8464509 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8464510 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8464511 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8464512 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8464513 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8464514 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8464515 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8464516 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8464517 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8464518 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8464519 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8464520 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8464521 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8464522 in the great green room there was a telephone and a red ballon and a picture of
8464523 reading the man a portrait of robert e lee through his private letters
8464524 traffic why we drive the way we do and what it says about us
8464525 dangerous waters modern day piracy and terror on the high seas
8464526 how to know if you have been sipping too much of the cool aide
8464527 if crossfit is a cult then im drinking the kool ade
8464528 there will come a time in your career when you have to decide whether you want to be somebody or make a difference
8464529 i am very happy very proud i have done a country of 4 million people done my family proud my parents
8464530 i still support phil and i believe in the technology knowing the other business people who have been involved with him and who have seen it working

8464557 its been a great occupation weve enjoyed every minute of it
8464558 without a doubt its been a hard decision to make
8464559 when the summer rolls around im sure we will miss it
8464560 when she got into the pool she had white knuckles she was holding on so tight she was really quite fearful
8464561 people come back from years gone by just to see the pool because they had such good memories
8464562 charter is pleased that an agreement in principle to offer the big ten network to our customers has been reached
8464563 we believe this agreement is in the best interests of all charter customers we will work closely with btn to add the channel as soon as possible to our lineups hopefully in time for this saturdays opening games
8464564 for seam allowances to both directions length amp width if the table is 14
8464565 was that a great moment and new york has been so proud to support our great leader hillary clinton and now we are equally proud to support barack obama
8464566 eh he was better than mark warner but not top 10
8464567 i will take you back to the good ol clinton days of peace and prosperity
8464568 just checking mccains politics have not changed that much in 3 years the only thing that defines his record in the last 3 years is a liberal bipartisan immigration bill and the surge
8464569 each elector casts one vote for president and one vote for vice president
8464570 that speaks volumes about how hard the democrats have to work to turn mccain into bush
8464571 bush has had no legislative agenda in his third term at all
8464572 if the congress is going to be democratic the last thing you want is a tax and spend liberal signing the checks the worst outcomes happen when the same party controls the congress and the white house a vote for divided government is a vote for mccain
8464573 if kerry had made speeches like this in his 04 run he would have been president best line of the night
8464574 heres my family here are my beautiful girls as you can see were not muslim extremists btw barack is not related to osama bin laden
8464575 were you in this just for me or was it for people like you now vote for obama you pumas dont be dumbasses
8464576 john mccain was for it before he was against it
8464577 no im not going to give the media the satisfaction of seeing be be bitter you should all vote for obama bush inherited a pretty good country and ran it into the ditch and mccain was his wing man every step of the way
8464578 you know folks thats the america that george bush has left us and thats the america well continue to get if george excuse me if john mccain is elected president of the united states of america freudian slip freudian slip
8464579 obama is the best man for the job of potus
8464580 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8464581 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8464582 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8464583 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8464584 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8464585 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8464586 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8464587 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8464588 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8464589 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8464590 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8464591 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8464592 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8464593 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8464594 i think well view the super cup as a one off and we want to win it obviously
8464595 but it is also an opportunity to play anderson back from the olympic games nani whos available from suspension and if possible gary neville i think those three will all figure in fridays game
8464596 patrice evra and wayne rooney will also be involved after that it depends whos back from injury if owen hargreaves has maintained his training performances he will play i think well play a strong team but therell certainly be some changes
8464597 danny looked good in training and hell get a chance against manchester united provided that all the paperwork is done on time
8464598 arshavin is flying with us to monaco but i havent decided yet if he would play or not
8464599 obviously we wont buy for the sake of it we do need good players but with amrabat pieters from fc utrecht and now nijland we signed potentially great players but also affordable players its harder for us to sign former ajax or az talents they are much more expensive and we do regret that aissati left us
8464600 we have a complete assessment of all dutch talents in pro football stef nijland for instance was assessed more than 20 times on various aspects of the game
8464601 we have several lists a scouting list for players who could play for psv 1 immediately and a list of future players like nijland who we signed for the future now stef can get used to the level we aspire to in eindhoven and we can prepare him for the big games
8464602 again its not that we want to be az or something but due to the fact that we qualify for the cl for years already we can afford to strengthen our group
8464603 its not that we wont scout in south america anymore but i just want to see more dutch lads in our team players we can identify with players who dont need to assimilate
8464604 you need that mix you need players who can perform on a weekly basis to even out the youngsters who sometimes play like gods and the next week like garbage men its also important for the hierarchy in the dressing room
8464605 i feel weirdly more comfortable and relaxed when im out of the studio which is a sanitized environment
8464606 tell him to give me a quick call tell him not to forget the little people
8464607 i feel weirdly more comfortable and relaxed when im out of the studio which is a sanitized environment
8464608 you pick up on the energy of your surroundings its much more like my old job i can really loosen up
8464609 a crazy media spin cycle that was sort of surreal to watch
8464610 the perfect vehicle for her to spread her wings a little bit
8464611 this may not be our biggest gig this week but youre certainly the liveliest
8464612 okay beam over your vcard ill give you a call tomorrow
8464613 uhm cant beam anything over bluetooth sorry its just for my headset
8464614 i throw business cards into a drawer next to my desk never to be looked at again
8464615 this launch is the reinforcement of our commitment to bring more useful information to people around the world and especially to a hyper growth country like india where maps are changing on a daily basis given the rapid of infrastructure development
8464616 know how you can tell a crime isnt going to be successful
8464617 would be obama plotters everyones eager to minimize the threat
8464618 were an empire now and when we act we create our own reality and while youre studying that reality judiciously as you will well act again creating other new realities which you can study too and thats how things will sort out were historys actors and you all of you will be left to just study what we do
8464619 tightening the reins on campaign speeches and stressing that speakers emphasize a rags to riches theme
8464620 im sorry the iranians are training the extremists not al qaeda not al qaeda
8464621 were an empire now and when we act we create our own reality and while youre studying that reality judiciously as you will well act again creating other new realities which you can study too and thats how things will sort out were historys actors and you all of you will be left to just study what we do
8464622 the capability and their opportunity plunger 30 odds are higher that a police informant at a bar or one of the tweakers meth customers overheard something and then talked to the police who are trying to claim all the credit and keep their source alive stuff like this is gold im sure it buys you a few get out of jail free cards for using last i heard the feds were listening to arabs ecoterrorists and left wing democrats what are the odds that the feds were even listening to much less thought that a bunch of angry tweaking white guys were a threat even with computer programs that look for code words the feds would be hauling in half my old home town for questioning about violent stuff said about obama on the phone cbl2 august 27th 2008 at 1 23 pm cbl2 48 from one of davids links law enforcement officials were also investigating whether the men were linked to vandalism shootings that targeted at least two federal buildings in denver over the past two weeks windows were shot at the u s custom house and the u s military entrance processing station on the same street in denvers downtown federal district additionally a bullet was recovered from a hertz rental car that was hit on aug 15 and authorities are now looking to see if it could have matched the guns seized from the men nah no way these guys were a threat or would ever have fired those weapons in a just world theyd get 10 to 20
8464623 theyre asking for another four years in a just world theyd get 10 to 20
8464624 the gossips know now after many years of searching that it cant be read past gate not packed all together and if great knot unraveled is the whole set then great knot unraveled can never be read
8464625 that its no longer any use since you know that it doesnt does it
8464626 no no it will be a long time before we have learned everything there is to learn even from little knot but well it seemed when the system was first being truly searched in st olives time it seemed that it seemed there was a promise that one day it would be seen all together and answer all questions now we know it wont not ever when that was first understood there were gossips who broke up their systems and some who left belaire that was a sad time
8464627 whatever happened between ash and me is over im really fond of the bachchans abhishek is a buddy and i really like him

8464629 it is true that salman and abhishek met at mehboob studios on monday afternoon they chatted for some time salman is extremely fond of abhishek
8464630 you need to understand that if i define rush a certain way that completely divorces it from how other people define it and you are using it that means that all your arguments are wrong and the game is fine you just
8464631 you need to understand that if i define rush a certain way that completely divorces it from how other people define it and you are using it that means that all your arguments are wrong and the game is fine you just
8464632 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8464633 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8464634 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8464635 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8464636 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8464637 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8464638 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8464639 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8464640 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8464641 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8464642 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8464643 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8464644 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8464645 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8464646 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8464647 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8464648 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8464649 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8464650 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8464651 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8464652 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8464653 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8464654 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8464655 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8464656 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8464657 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8464658 why do your employees think they are under paid how do you establish a value for a new product why did the enron fraud occur why is ceo pay out of control why is your competitors product selling better than yours is
8464659 looking at the same questions that standard economics is looking at but without assuming people are rational
8464660 in a way you rise up in a way you are better in a way your hand is hard but gentle like a feather
8464661 its ok to let a fool kiss you but dont let a kiss fool you
8464662 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
8464663 i heard where its a misery wrapped in an enema that doesnt sound too good
8464664 and while i do enjoy my fair share of gore sites i cannot in my wildest imagination see anything bad about to happen to that sweet child
8464665 kidrythm knows whats best and is in the moral right
8464666 cora o do homem bomba faz tum tum at o dia em que ele fizer bum
8464667 the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8464668 its the destruction of a human life this teaching has not changed and remains unchanged
8464669 you go from this primal state of being arced up and filled with fury to a point where everything is okay again then you fall into each others arms and refuse to let go the energy from your anger carries over and the sex is mind blowing
8464670 the people in the medical helicopter said that i must have a concussion because i just kept repeating the same word over and over aki but they didnt know it was my dog
8464671 i cant imagine i cant imagine ever crossing that street again
8464672 not with a cane i cant imagine crossing it again by myself
8464673 i still want a crosswalk i want a big wide crosswalk so nobody else gets killed there
8464674 and i want stop signs until they put a light in
8464675 this mega abortion center is just right down the street from the main campus of the university of houston and not very far from rice university and texas state university so a lot of kids from out of state go to school here
8464676 in fact we have a website texasfamilies org and on the front page we have a statement where you can add your name
8464677 the statement says you oppose planned parenthoods expansion here in houston
8464678 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
8464679 we just want people to go back to their normal lives
8464680 the house had five bedrooms two living rooms and a kitchen when we came back the house was leveled even the furniture was buried under the rubble
8464681 we just want people to go back to their normal lives
8464682 one of the main goals of the terrorists was to keep people from their homes by bringing them back to their areas we will deal a death blow to the terrorists
8464683 all the families that are coming back are living peacefully
8464684 we went to the district council 100 times asking about the compensation
8464685 my leg was straight and i couldnt bend it the muscle was in spasm and i had a lot of pain
8464686 as you can see i am completely out of breath she really pushed me to the limit
8464687 i was just trying to come back to normal position where i could just stand up and regroup again and play the next point
8464688 i thought i was going to get my dress really dirty that was my biggest concern
8464689 i would have loved to take a nap on the court because i was really exhausted but you know the rules are the rules i had to keep going
8464690 its an amazing feeling i just play much more confident
8464691 when we go to baylor next week we will play to win and we will expect to win even though theyre in a bcs conference this week the shoe is on the other foot
8464692 the a amp m commerce players are good weve watched film we know theyve gotten more good players in there over the past year were going to have to play well to win
8464693 its our job to go out and play every play the best we can and when we make mistakes to go to the next play and do better if we give the kind of effort we expect then we have to believe that we will play well enough to win the game no matter who is on the other sideline
8464694 you look around the last couple of years and there are plenty of examples of the underdog winning these games whether its a division ii team winning against an fcs division i team or an fcs team going in and beating a bowl subdivision team
8464695 our guys have seen the film hey their defensive line is bigger than our d line theyve got some very nice talent and they are very well coached we have to be concerned with doing our jobs giving great effort and making things happen
8464696 weve seen the work going on for a long time now and a lot of activity while theyve been putting in the new scoreboard
8464697 its the season opener its the first home game theres a lot of hype and excitement and everybody is talking to us about it so we are getting geared up to get it on saturday run through that purple smoke and make the crowd roar
8464698 there are some people in my classes that i would like to play card games with and by card games i mean sex
8464699 can you guess how many fingers i had before the war
8464700 if bush cant do the right thing for new orleans how can we trust that the right thing is happening in baghdad
8464701 im feeling so bad and so good i dont know what to do
8464702 because there are people who need us we bring top quality international plastic surgeons into areas that would ordinarily never have the opportunity to access this level of care
8464703 we have the chance to help people who cant afford it its tremendously fulfilling work
8464704 para nosotros el mayor logro es que el mariachi est retomando su lugar muestra de que el mariachi est mejor que nunca es que se festejar n 15 a os del encuentro el mejor de este tipo a nivel internacional
8464705 it was never a threat to any command and control or operations computer
8464706 russias recognition of the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia violates the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia
8464707 we deplore russias excessive use of military forces in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8464708 i think that showing this in cinemas can only add to the distress and grief felt by the de menezes family and the survivors of 7 7 and those who lost loved ones on that day
8464709 the hurt and pain doesnt go away overnight films like this only serve to stir up those painful memories
8464710 i feel the film paints a picture of the police as being incompetent and biased
8464711 but ultimately it wasnt the predictable plot or poor acting that caused offence to me but the cynical attempt to make money from a tragic event
8464712 i support barack obama because america needs a president who has the strength wisdom and courage to talk to our enemies and consult with our allies a president who has the judgment to use war as a last resort not a first resort
8464713 the time has come for a president who has lived the american dream who is on our side a president who will cut our dependence on foreign oil and lead us into the new energy frontier a president who will make us stronger and safer as americans
8464714 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country we support enthusiastically his plans to restore the american dream for american families and we stand united proudly in our determination to elect barack obama
8464715 bond is a budding all american he plans to train for the 2012 olympic games in london as well as the 2016 games by then hell be in his prime in his mid 20s

8464743 let me tell you before he ever debates barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself
8464744 my opponent talks like barack obama but he votes like george bush
8464745 i tried to convey who i am and how critically important the oregon race is to winning a strong senate majority
8464746 i think it showed his continued growth as a candidate
8464747 im already hearing a lot of good things about how he has impressed people here

8464749 i suppose i could be pregnant but i doubt it
8464750 well well do the test anyway because if you are pregnant we cant give you the peridium
8464751 um yeah why would we have had the discussion about this very thing if i wasnt sure
8464752 well other than the fact that they wont give me any peridium because im pregnant so i get to feel like ive got to urgently pee until the medicine kicks in yeah im doing just great justin named changed of course
8464753 congratulations on your successful abortion we appriciate your effort in not over populating the earth
8464754 chin up on your decision and follow though on the abortion old gal now go get yourself a margarita youre drinking for one again
8464755 i dont know it seems weird to me that youre not more freaked out by this why isnt this upsetting to you why arent you needing me why arent you crying why arent you struggling
8464756 why should i cry justin why would i need you to get through this dont get me wrong youre a part of this and im glad youre here but why should this cause me to struggle a breakdown would infer that i believed that what i was doing was wrong i think many women who have this procedure may do so believing that they are killing a child or terminating potential with that belief system in their hearts of course this would be a battle a struggle of the mind and soul however i dont believe im killing i dont think that there is a soul attached to the collection of cells inside me i dont believe that life starts at conception and i dont believe the soul enters into a life until much later into the pregnancy or maybe even not until birth i have studied i have researched and read and soul searched and i am secure in my beliefs i am certain in my convictions i am having a surgical procedure to terminate a pregnancy i am removing a zygote im scheduled to have an abortion justin thats what we decided together we agreed upon it we justin im okay with it why would i break down i am not now nor have i ever been interested in having a child you know that justin i am happy with my life the way it is babies are a lot of work and i think that way too many people have them without being fully prepared for how much work it is dont you remember im the girl who thinks you should have to successfully complete parenting classes before youre allowed to take youre baby home im the one who thinks chinas one child per couple is a great thing anyway i havent broken down because i dont need to break down im not struggling with this decision because its not a new decision ive thought about this for 18 years and am good with it i dont feel any guilt over this but i do feel nervous i dont feel sorrow but i do feel irritated that i have to go through this at all i dont feel a need to cry but i do feel angry that i have had to spend two additional weeks in constant nausea so justin i dont need to lean on your shoulder but i may need you to give me room to rant i dont need you to hold me up but i may need you to give me the space to just be i am not going to feel bad for not feeling bad okay and now that im thinking about it justin i find it incredibly insulting that you agree with and support my decision to terminate this pregnancy but your questions infer that you believe i should suffer for it in some way you dont want the responsibility of a child either but youre obviously bothered by the fact that this isnt destroying me i dont think your question is about me i think you need to reconcile your belief systems surrounding this its not my job to absolve you for your decision to support and participate in this abortion if you are having guilt then you deal with your guilt if you are feeling like you are doing something wrong then youve got to process that all on your own i may be the one having the procedure but we got pregnant we are both involved in this decision and we are both responsible for the outcome you are not disconnected from the abortion just because you dont have to lie on the exam table with your feet in stirrups perhaps you are the one who needs to freak out and if so ill be here to listen but im not going to play out your issues for you
8464757 dont be mad at justin he was concerned about you and had never dealt with this before and so he turned to bill bill told me

8464780 the kind of money generated around the industry is way out of proportion the admiration bestowed on actors is also out of perspective
8464781 in fact cash flow in the business remains very strong and the company has delivered a cash operating surplus of 23 6m for the period
8464782 hes making that noise again and he knows i hate it
8464783 well honey does that make you feel like he doesnt respect your wishes do you feel like he needs to listen to what matters to you and take your feelings into consideration do you feel like you might want to sit down and discuss it when youve had time to calm down and not react in anger
8464784 we used to read stuff and then wed get scared and ask each other did we break up yesterday
8464785 the battle born state thats the battleground state in the 2008 presidential election and home to senate majority leader harry reid nevada casts eight votes for sen hillary clinton and 25 votes for sen barack obama because he has the vision for the west investing in renewable energy preparing for our veterans and keeping nuclear waste out of yucca mountain
8464786 nevada is a battleground state and it is a state we need to win to make sure we take back the white house
8464787 the reason we havent done anything up to this point i blame both republicans and democrats
8464788 they havent done a damn thing on energy for 40 years
8464789 this is a problem that has nothing to do with politics im not in it and you all know im not im out of politics im trying to fix the energy problem

8464794 arizona has about half the worlds population of known fumarase deficiency patients
8464795 it exists in a certain percentage of the broader population but once you get a tendency to inbreed youre inbreeding people who have the gene there so you markedly increase the risk of developing the condition
8464796 the disease itself is very rare in the rest of the world
8464797 once you get people within in the same community marrying then the chances grow of having two people carrying the exact same mutation
8464798 there arent any new people coming in its a closed door and that gene just keeps getting passed around
8464799 any person who joined that community could have brought that mutation with them
8464800 if they are willing to marry their cousin or unwilling but do it anyway or even in a relationship that is closer than that it can be very hard for them
8464801 they will tell you if thats what god wants for you than thats what you will get
8464802 they dont think too much about marrying cousins and things like that
8464803 can there be any doubt now that she would have been a compelling nominee
8464804 but she is not the nominee and she asks her supporters the question they must all answer were you in this campaign just for me
8464805 the healing of a convention the uniting of the democratic party happens in this moment
8464806 could she have possibly left any doubts or any doubters on the table could she have possibly done anything more
8464807 between my roommate and me we didnt think the speech was especially conciliatory
8464808 if you really paid attention she didnt talk much about obama she had a few zingers on john mccain but it didnt dominate her speech it was mostly hillarys time and to toot the hills horn
8464809 as the cameras panned the convention floor after what was supposed to have been a big night of unity for the democrats i remain unconvinced that a sea change has occurred amongst the party faithful and that there has been a conversion on the proverbial road to damascus for the obama persecuting clintonites
8464810 our delegation is split about 50 50 and a lot of hillary supporters were tearing up
8464811 the dums still dont know that the message that appeals to their moonbats doesnt appeal to the rest of the country
8464812 dear fans in columbus i havent let you down before and i wont let you down now
8464813 until you hear from me again remember you are the sun i am the moon you are the words i am the tune forgive me i love you
8464814 dont ruin the event wait till the cake comes out the kitchen before you eat it thats like a kid who sees his toys before christmas it takes away from me and from the fans as well
8464815 los trabajadores de la prensa somos personas que ganamos un sueldo por cubrir una informaci n no determinamos la l nea de los medios de comunicaci n y somos utilizados para los intereses pol ticos de los propietarios

8464817 it would be wonderful if local banks in birmingham would invest in this
8464818 to date we havent seen that level of commitment if the business community doesnt believe in birmingham why should others outside
8464819 id think its the current economic conditions more than anything construction has slowed down in birmingham in general
8464820 my biggest concern is the knowledge transfer between the new people and those who are going out the door most of our staff is either under the age of 28 or over the age of 55 so we have a large knowledge gap we need to capture the legacy of the people who are leaving how do we avoid the mistakes how do we avoid going back to ways or methods that were not successful for us
8464821 we started the negotiations in 2007 so this has been in the works for quite a while now
8464822 this is truly a historic occasion to get a band of this renown in northern nevada they have played at presidential inaugurations and super bowl halftimes so this is an opportunity to see one of the worlds most famous bands

8464849 i have the greatest respect for the military service and sacrifice of john mccain in the vietnam war

8464922 particularities are imperfections the source of error parochialism and prejudice truth by contrast is abstract timeless universal and the same everywhere for everyone
8464923 western religion has been haunted by platos ghost the result is inevitable and tragic if all truth religious as well as scientific is the same for everyone at all times then if i am right you are wrong if i care about truth i must convert you to my point of view and if you refuse to be converted beware from this flowed some of the great crimes of history and much human blood

8464925 that the proposition at the heart of monotheism is not what it has traditionally taken to be one god therefore one faith one truth one way to the contrary it is that unity creates diversity
8464926 most haunting of the saying of the jewish sages a story they told about the creation of hu mankind
8464927 this is an audacious theological interpretation god it suggests was in two minds before creating humankind yes humanity is capable of great acts of altruism and self sacrifice but it is also constantly at war human beings tell lies and are full of strife god takes truth and throws it to the ground meaning for life to be livable truth on earth cannot be what it is in heaven
8464928 truth on the ground is multiple partial fragments of it lie everywhere each person culture and language has part of it none has it all
8464929 truth on earth is not nor can it aspire to be the whole truth it is limited not comprehensive particular not universal when two propositions conflict it is not necessarily because one is true the other false it may be and often is that each represents a different perspective on reality an alternative way of structuring order no more and no less commensurable than a shakespeare sonnet a michelangelo painting or a schubert sonata
8464930 in heaven there is truth on earth there are truths therefore each culture has something to contribute each person knows something no one else does the sages said who is wise one who learns from all men the wisest is not one who knows himself wiser than others he is one who knows all men have some share of the truth and is willing to learn from them for none of us knows all the truth and each of us knows some of it

8464950 they went for a movie neither we nor the school were aware of their whereabouts the children were missing for around seven hours when they did not return home in time we went looking for them at the school later one of them called up saying that they wanted to come back home and that we should come and get them

8464957 the public was firstly told that mr peters had not received any money from mr glenn then the public was told that mr peters had in fact received a donation but had not known about it and then finally yesterday they were told that mr peters had personally solicited the donation

8464962 if you want to judge how well a person understands christianity find out how much he makes of the thought of being gods child and having god as father if this is not the thought that prompts and controls his worship and prayers and his whole outlook on life it means that he does not undertand christianity very well at all
8464963 to be right with god the judge is a great thing but to be loved and cared for by god the father is far greater
8464964 you may conclude with absolute certainty that if you love god that he has loved you all this is through god and for god and to the glory of god

8464975 no one could orchestrate this this does come from their hearts
8464976 maybe im wrong but it doesnt sound like cn is even meeting with people i back right up to the tracks and i feel its going to kill business in barrington hopefully what will come out of this is that cn decides to work with the suburbs but my opinion is that they dont care
8464977 the purpose of the walk to me is that it shows something outside the controlled environment that cn has managed to arrange theyre trying to fine tune everything to make sure its as pretty as can be
8464978 theres a lot of energy to keep barrington the way it is
8464979 i hope that they see its important to stand up for things you believe in or in this case thing you dont believe in

8464997 what about that other thing the one that looks like a saddle except its too damned big
8464998 its mostly leather but it looks as much like a river raft as it does a howdah and it must weigh a ton why does it have two levels with a silvery stairway on swivels in between
8464999 my idea i sit high on his shoulders in the small saddle you see so i can talk to him i use the aluminum stairway to reach my saddle
8465000 that explains the stairs between the seat and the howdah i suppose and the rope ladder attached to the right side of the big howdah your dragons taller than a giraffe still im puzzled you talk to him i thought you rode him
8465001 its how i control him hes too big for reins or anything like that i tell him what i want him to do and he usually does it sometimes i touch him with my feet
8465002 what if he doesnt listen to you what do you do then
8465003 if you ride on his shoulder why do you need the rest the howdah looks more like a hot tub i mean the way the way everyone sits in a circle facing inward
8465004 my idea too i saw a hot tub about the size of our howdah and how many it seated
8465005 but the railing if everyone has a seat why do you need a railing
8465006 the first time we had alfy run everyone in the howdah thought they were going to be thrown out we all agreed we feel safer with a railing
8465007 and the double bitted axes fastened to either side of the howdah
8465008 we fasten alfys howdah with thick heavy ropes if ever alfys saddle and howdah place him in jeopardy we chop him free one has to anticipate problems oh a correction alfy is a him not an it
8465009 dont stay with alfy when he jumps as dark as it is you cant see anything clearly so stay away so your lines wont tangle
8465010 in the 1990s the gazan fishing industry produced an annual income of around 5m that had halved by 2007 and is still shrinking fast under the oslo accords which in 1993 were supposed to herald the coming of an independent palestinian state gazan fishermen were to be allowed 20 nautical miles out to sea where they could catch sardine as they migrated from the nile delta up towards turkey during the spring but israeli naval ships in recent years have imposed their own much reduced limits sometimes fewer than 6 miles out
8465011 what gives israel the right to take away the livelihood of these fishermen and why does the world allow them to destroy an industry that used to provide for thousands of palestinians

8465024 i am honored to be here tonight to support barack obama and to warm up the crowd for joe biden though as youll soon see he doesnt need any help from me i love joe biden and america will too what a year we democrats have had the primary began with an all star line up and came down to two remarkable americans locked in a hard fought contest to the very end the campaign generated so much heat it increased global warming
8465025 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november heres why our nation is in trouble on two fronts the american dream is under siege at home and americas leadership in the world has been weakened
8465026 clearly the job of the next president is to rebuild the american dream and restore americas standing in the world everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8465027 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8465028 they took us from record surpluses to an exploding national debt from over 22 million new jobs down to 5 million from an increase in working family incomes of 7 500 to a decline of more than 2 000 from almost 8 million americans moving out of poverty to more than 5 and a half million falling into poverty and millions more losing their health insurance now in spite of all the evidence their candidate is promising more of the same more tax cuts for the wealthiest americans that will swell the deficit increase inequality and weaken the economy more band aids for health care that will enrich insurance companies impoverish families and increase the number of uninsured more going it alone in the world instead of building the shared responsibilities and shared opportunities necessary to advance our security and restore our influence
8465029 barack obama will lead us away from division and fear of the last eight years back to unity and hope if like me you still believe america must always be a place called hope then join hillary chelsea and me in making senator barack obama the next president of the united states
8465030 our members and retirees have earned a fair and equitable contract through years of hard work sacrifice and uncertainty
8465031 todays vote of total support shows that the same spirit of unity and solidarity that saved the steel industry in north america and created the profitability now enjoyed by the companies is still alive and well in the men and women we represent

8465060 so you stupid bitch you decided you want more punishment huh
8465061 well one day after school i came home a little bit early because i had started my period and got blood all over my shorts so i just ran home
8465062 you see everything was fine until i looked into the kitchen and saw you on your knees sucking my brothers dick
8465063 that broke my heart laci stephanie slapped laci so hard against her stomach blood came to the surface then she did the unthinkable stephanie bit lacis pussy lip hard laci tried to scream but the more she tried to scream the more the gag ball slipped into her mouth and made her want to vomit
8465064 its my turn to have some fun with you now laci
8465065 jason told me that you had gotten into drugs and forced him into sexual behavior that wasnt acceptable he promised it would never happen again but i needed to keep it a secret or you said you would scream rape and he would go to jail

8465072 the u s has to make sure who these people are which makes it very difficult for those who are truly qualified the barrier is much higher than it used to be
8465073 they are reluctant to identify themselves so they dont get work and their children dont go to school
8465074 they the christians are especially targeted i realized this and am going to try at my small scale and remedy it
8465075 you have to treat iraqi christians as a persecuted minority under the overall umbrella of minorities
8465076 there should be very clear protection of iraqi minorities the idea of a christian quota would backfire
8465077 john paul ii predicted that iraqi christians would be targeted for reprisals for the u s invasion it made him concerned for the future of the christian presence not just in iraq but the entire middle east
8465078 what john paul ii thought would happen to iraqi christians has happened
8465079 encourage christians who left the country to go back and be part of the social structure of iraq again
8465080 there has to be accountability based upon basic human rights for anyone who is targeted or as christians they will face further retribution
8465081 but i always kind of feel like you have one life to live so you cant hold back
8465082 we had a goal line running drill early in camp and i tell you hes a load he may be a really nice change of pace to some of our smaller backs we can put him in and let him hammer the ball a little bit
8465083 he kind of got lost in the shuffle after mason left and he came in and said he didnt know what to do said former glencoe silver lake coach dave dose
8465084 i said jon what do you want to do he said i want to go the u and give it a try and i told him hed just answered his own question
8465085 theres some stuff where i feel a little rusty hoese said
8465086 he was an incredible high school running back dose said
8465087 you give him the ball and hed just drag people and break tackles and the sight the average fan might not have seen was the blocking he literally put linebackers on their backs
8465088 a few times with hoeses love of snowmobile racing the good news for brewster is that hoese said hes put the snowmobiles on hold until the end of his college football career
8465089 im not going to lie though i do miss it hoese said
8465090 everybody is out there for one reason thats to try to get to october
8465091 i just tried to keep us in the game thats all i can do

8465100 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

8465111 my caylee is missing current mood distraught this precious little angel from above gave me strength and unconditional love now she is gone and i don t know why jealousy has taken her away jealousy from the one person that should be thankful for all of the love and support given to her a daughter comes to her mother for support when she is pregnant the mother says without hesitation it will be ok and it was but then the lies and betrayal began the daughter who stole money lots of money leaves without warning and does not let her mother now speak to the baby that her mother raised where did she go who is now watching out for the little angel

8465117 barack obama is the man for this job barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8465118 thats one of the things i admire about him hes a real spouse and he reacts the way a real spouse does
8465119 he didnt like when his wife was attacked and he responded accordingly and thats the way i hope my spouse would have reacted if i was attacked
8465120 mr clinton sought and often managed to convince americans that the global economy was an opportunity and not a threat
8465121 whatever his legacy from this campaign that legacy of his presidency should be built upon
8465122 hes sort of yesterdays man trying to be todays man and he seems angry about it
8465123 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8465124 everything ive learned in my eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8465125 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8465126 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8465127 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour

8465138 you could be booking a boutique paris hotel after seeing lovely pictures of the lobby but then you end up with dirty sheets in the room with the video you can capture that straight away
8465139 if youre offering a financial incentive people may be tempted to post something which is perhaps not as truthful as it would be to get a reward
8465140 its harder to hide the truth in a video than it is in words
8465141 videos capture straight away the atmosphere of the hotel so it is difficult to make the experience more positive than it is
8465142 like with youtube visitors can comment on the videos reviewers can get negative comments on their posts
8465143 the most rated videos get more prominence on the site if a video gets a negative response the video will go downwards

8465148 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8465149 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8465150 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8465151 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8465152 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8465153 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8465154 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8465155 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8465156 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8465157 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8465158 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8465159 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8465160 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8465161 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8465162 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8465163 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8465164 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8465165 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8465166 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8465167 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8465168 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8465169 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8465170 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8465171 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8465172 we definitely dont want to wait until saturday or sunday to decide what to do
8465173 we dont need anything of this magnitude to come here
8465174 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8465175 we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8465176 im not going to worry about it until i see it in the gulf
8465177 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8465178 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8465179 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8465180 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8465181 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8465182 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8465183 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8465184 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8465185 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

8465201 the national archives and records administration nara issued e mail archiving applications
8465202 the federal reserve boards survey of consumer finances for 2004 provides insights into changes in family income and net worth since the 2001 survey the survey shows that over the 2001 04 period the
8465203 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8465204 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8465205 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8465206 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8465207 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8465208 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8465209 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8465210 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8465211 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8465212 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8465213 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8465214 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8465215 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8465216 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8465217 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8465218 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8465219 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8465220 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8465221 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8465222 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8465223 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8465224 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8465225 with the credit crunch squeezing household budgets people can ill afford this extra tax grab its dishonest and unjust for politicians to wrap revenue raising tax hikes in a green banner
8465226 the government is talking about raising taxes even further but our conclusions show that green taxes should be kept as they are or cut
8465227 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8465228 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8465229 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8465230 since some sort of change emerges from everything we conceive or create all of our inventions innovations ideas and ideals are mcluhan media
8465231 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8465232 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8465233 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8465234 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8465235 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

8465242 what does it profit my brethren if someone says he has faith but does not have works can faith save him if a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food and one of you says to them depart in peace be warmed and filled but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body what does it profit thus also faith by itself if it does not have works is dead

8465244 rabies is primarily a disease of children who are particularly at risk from this terrible disease due to their close contact with dogs the major global source
8465245 children are more likely to suffer multiple bites and scratches to the face and head both of which carry a higher risk of contracting rabies children are often unaware of the danger that dogs transmit rabies and may not tell their parents when a bite lick or scratch has occurred from an infected animal
8465246 vaccination prior to possible exposure is a crucial part of health management of domestic animals and is the single most important factor in rabies prevention
8465247 through the world rabies day campaign we continue to engage all the major stakeholders associated with rabies to take action

8465259 giant us style prisons may be easier to build but all the evidence here and abroad says the price we would pay in running them and in higher re offending rates is far too high if ministers want prisons to be focused on rehabilitation rather than warehousing offenders until they are released then it is not too late to make these plans disappear as fast as they appeared

8465261 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8465262 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8465263 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba

8465267 they would go off and come back and there wasnt anything unusual about them at all nothing that would even make us think this was going on
8465268 last night after three hours i still didnt want to accept the fact that it was him
8465269 we were petrified and i just couldnt imagine knowing gerry in high school and dorene i cant imagine that anything like that happened

8465273 no one was able to advance a decent argument that eating meat is morally acceptable this resulted in a lengthy discussion on how we all think eating meat is wrong but do it anyway
8465274 that we consider ourselves entitled to take the lives of animals merely to satisfy our taste buds astounds me its sooo self centred and anthropocentric
8465275 no one was able to advance a decent argument that eating meat is morally acceptable
8465276 this was not my experience of the discussion nor my conclusion
8465277 meat eating does not necessarily cause suffering so this is not an argument that proves meat eating is wrong
8465278 so we should eat less meat or try to develop more efficient forms of meat farming without causing suffering again this is not an argument that shows meat eating to be wrong

8465283 therefore i tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or drink or about your body what you will wear is not life more important than food and the body more important than clothes
8465284 and why do you worry about clothes see how the lilies of the field grow they do not labor or spin yet i tell you that not even solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these if that is how god clothes the grass of the field which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire will he not much more clothe you o you of little faith so do not worry saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or what shall we wear for the pagans run after all these things and your heavenly father knows that you need them but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well therefore do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about itself each day has enough trouble of its own

8465294 therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about christ and go on to maturity not laying again the foundation of repentance from acts that lead to death and of faith in god instruction about baptisms the laying on of hands the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment and god permitting we will do so it is impossible for those who have once been enlightened who have tasted the heavenly gift who have shared in the holy spirit who have tasted the goodness of the word of god and the powers of the coming age if they fall away to be brought back to repentance because to their loss they are crucifying the son of god all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is farmed receives the blessing of god but land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and is in danger of being cursed in the end it will be burned even though we speak like this dear friends we are confident of better things in your case things that accompany salvation god is not unjust he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them we want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end in order to make your hope sure we do not want you to become lazy but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised

8465306 green taxes are set far higher than is necessary to pay for our carbon footprint which loads an unfair burden onto hard pressed british families and businesses
8465307 with the credit crunch squeezing household budgets people can ill afford this extra tax grab its dishonest and unjust for politicians to wrap revenue raising tax hikes in a green banner
8465308 the government is talking about raising taxes even further but our conclusions show that green taxes should be kept as they are or cut
8465309 the government is on the verge of making a massive costly and hugely damaging mistake that will destabilise the criminal justice system for years to come
8465310 giant us style prisons may be easier to build but all the evidence here and abroad says the price we would pay in running them and in higher re offending rates is far too high if ministers want prisons to be focused on rehabilitation rather than warehousing offenders until they are released then it is not too late to make these plans disappear as fast as they appeared

8465313 ill never forget it and now that im the mother of three will never do anything like that to one of my own still hurts
8465314 in any place under circumstances that expose the child to an unreasonable risk of harm
8465315 i could have exposed my son to grave danger i do know that but in the moment of anger i didnt think clearly
8465316 is it something law enforcement gets involved with frequently and it leads to a criminal investigation its not something i see
8465317 in looking at these cases we look at previous history they may have information about prior instances involving these two people
8465318 he might have been trying teach his son a lesson maybe scare him i dont know if that is way out of bounds
8465319 would i do it probably not i wouldnt want to put my daughter in that situation its a bad world out there
8465320 abandoning your child is not going to teach them appropriate behavior it also can teach them that if they do something wrong then theyre going to be left
8465321 you want to work through the conflict and come up with reasonable consequences not deal with it by walking away
8465322 everybody is out there for one reason thats to try to get to october
8465323 i just tried to keep us in the game thats all i can do
8465324 he can reach back and get a couple extra miles an hour on it curveball and changeup is good as well it makes him really unhittable sometimes

8465329 its not really that big a deal they tell you have an off day but youve got to always prepare
8465330 alex got sick and there i was back in the lineup ive played enough games in my career so that i can jump back in and play
8465331 it hasnt been the kind of homestand that we drew up on a blueprint
8465332 we played all very good teams that are all in contention i think it just goes back to a real simple formula if you dont pitch good you dont have a chance
8465333 liz did enough to stay out of the big inning
8465334 he pitched around some walks i thought this time his changeup was real key for him because they were sitting on the fastball
8465335 theres just no other way of putting it i was just flat out awful
8465336 i couldnt even give us a chance to win i hope i can put this behind me pretty soon it will be a long night
8465337 john he not throw the ball the way weve see him throw the ball
8465338 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything in her power to elect barack obama
8465339 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us
8465340 that was the word i put out there in rehab
8465341 you want to finish an at bat finish an inning finish a game
8465342 i was down in the zone my slider was good and my two seamer also
8465343 i pitched a good game on a night when i needed to pitch a great game
8465344 i just failed to execute a big pitch when i needed it
8465345 timely hitting is how you know when a team is playing well
8465346 he was great we couldnt touch him early at all every time weve faced him weve got nothing hes legit hes a legit no 1
8465347 if that dont beat a hen layin in a wool basket
8465348 so what does the bill do it makes it harder for average people to file for bankruptcy protection it makes it easier for landlords to evict a bankrupt tenant it endangers child support payments by giving a wider array of creditors a shot at post bankruptcy income it allows millionaires to shield an unlimited amount of equity in homes and asset protection trusts it makes it more difficult for small businesses to reorganize while opening new loopholes for the enrons of the world it allows creditors to provide misleading information and it does nothing to rein in lending abuses
8465349 it turns out the average annual income of americans who file bankruptcy is less than 30k not the loose affiliation of millionaires and billionaires gigging the system that we all heard about when this bill was debated also the vast majority of people who file bankruptcy dont do so to strategically hang on to their mansion on the hill but because of medical bills a job layoff or both real people real lives
8465350 in most cases the existing laws do wipe away some debts particularly unsecured debt
8465351 well what are we supposed to do hes not perfect theyre not perfect but dont you think mccain would be worse

8465357 that young democracy has been subjected to an unjustified assault and the international community has joined in condemning russias invasion of a sovereign democratic neighbor and its recognition of georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia
8465358 we support their democracy and well work with our allies to ensure georgias territorial integrity as a free and independent nation
8465359 the georgian people won their freedom after years of tyranny and they can count on the friendship of the united states
8465360 section were scary enough to make me want to see what i can

8465365 its easy to add any kind of flavor you want
8465366 she was someone who defined love devotion and constancy she defined from my perspective what marriage is supposed to be about
8465367 if there was a market for preventing cavities in rats id be a millionaire
8465368 it was set up so that our prayers would be answered and that the perpetrators would be caught and brought to justice this event was meant to heal the wounds of the family
8465369 she was quiet and so wonderful unassuming and always willing to help not only her church but the neighbors and the children in the community never have i seen her angry and ive known her all my life
8465370 north florence can be no better than what we allow it to be
8465371 when people realize they can call the police station and report crime and their identity not be revealed youll see a great difference in crime in this city
8465372 a mans home is his castle you should be able to go home and lock that door and have no body mess with you
8465373 no man has the right to invade those premises that is a right guaranteed to us by the constitution of this great nation
8465374 we wanted to give the mustang pony a more realistic feel
8465375 we lifted the head to make the pony more proud tipped the neck into the wind to give it a feeling of greater speed and better balance
8465376 its more chiseled and more defined and looks more like a wild horse
8465377 its more realistic in terms of proportion to an actual mustang
8465378 because hes supposed to be in the lineup roberts played and he killed us i think im going to blame cintron for that one
8465379 its not really that big a deal they tell you have an off day but youve got to always prepare
8465380 alex got sick and there i was back in the lineup ive played enough games in my career so that i can jump back in and play

8465386 i couldnt even give us a chance to win i hope i can put this behind me pretty soon it will be a long night
8465387 john he not throw the ball the way weve see him throw the ball
8465388 before john mccain debates barack obama he has to finish the debate with himself
8465389 no but they damn well could nominate a pro life african american who acknowledges the ruin wrought of affirmative action thatd be quite possible alan keyes whose 2000 republican presidential campaign t shirt i happen to be wearing at this very moment is just one such candidate
8465390 also it was a republican president who appointed our first two african american secretaries of state one of which is also a woman
8465391 you have turned for me my mourning into dancing you have loosed my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness that my glory may sing your praise and not be silent o lord my god i will give
8465392 the last time i talked to him he had made a decision to go to oklahoma city
8465393 that was last week i told him to hurry up and get on that and go
8465394 right now i dont know where he is i sent a text message to him and he hasnt texted me back
8465395 i think hes had offers from d 1 schools the most important thing for him this year is to play and then be part of a team and feel like hes needed on a team
8465396 although the agreement had been verbally made between him and coach p he felt like the chance he was being given wasnt really a chance they really werent behind him
8465397 he thought it would be better for him to start at a smaller school so he can play at a smaller school and hopefully go to the next level
8465398 the increasing worldwide acceptance of financial reporting using ifrs and u s investors increasing ownership of securities issued by foreign companies that report financial information using ifrs have led the commission to propose this cautious and careful plan clearly setting out the secs direction well in advance as well as the conditions that must be met will help fulfill our mission of protecting investors and facilitating capital formation

8465401 as an organization that started as a small guerilla group the tigers will retain their capacity to go back to their origins
8465402 the havoc that even a small group of determined persons can do is inestimable
8465403 at the halfway mark of the season we probably thought that we were going to play finals the way we were going
8465404 we had a bit of an easier run you could probably say after our first half and thats when we struggled a bit to finish those games off
8465405 id have to say wed be pretty disappointed with the way we finished off the year
8465406 a new generation not blinded by the old hates and fears and rivalries
8465407 we stand today at the edge of a new frontier the frontier of the 1960s the frontier of unknown opportunities and perils the frontier of unfulfilled hopes and unfilled threats the new frontier of which i speak is not a set of promises it is a set of challenges
8465408 the decision to move the speech outdoors was brilliant as was obamas this year
8465409 kennedys physical presence was electrifying and so is obamas a big outdoor audience maximizes their presence
8465410 give me your help give me your hand your voice and your vote
8465411 disappointing performance convinced him in the future to increase the amounts of steroids he normally took whenever he faced a stress of giving a major speech or press conference

8465413 hes got to connect with the wal mart voter and the guy who shops at wal mart is used to watching that stadium on sunday
8465414 sacking principals turning over staff closing schools that churning and instability that will occur in that process is not going to help students and may in fact damage communities

8465417 is at more of a high water mark than we are
8465418 one thing we never run into out there is a john mccain field organization
8465419 we think this is something that should be welcomed and celebrated the fact that were opening this up to average americans its been a great organizational tool we think about states colorado is a big battleground state and if it slips into the obama column from the mccain column his path just got a lot lot harder one of our best organizations now in the entire country will be in colorado as a result of this convention and the activities tomorrow night
8465420 we are still on track the process has speeded up and governments are very serious about negotiating a result in copenhagen
8465421 accra has laid the foundation of what could serve as a first negotiating text for a copenhagen deal
8465422 countries have made it very clear that issue of forests need to be part of a copenhagen deal
8465423 thats important because emissions from deforestation account for 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions
8465424 parties were deeply committed and submitted proposals for solutions on the issues
8465425 all in all the group has made good progress its important to take this progress forward in pozna when we return to the issue of the ranges of emissions reductions for developed countries under the kyoto protocol
8465426 one of the cdms shortcomings is that it is not leading to enough investments in africa
8465427 there is a real risk of africa becoming the forgotten continent in the context of the fight against climate change unless we manage to design a regime going into the future that take into account in a much more comprehensive way what africas specific needs are not only on adaptation but also on fuelling clean economic growth

8465438 looks like the dems agree obamas uncle is more qualified to be president than obama is seriously is this what they have to do for validity
8465439 should barack obama have been arrested and sentenced to a mandatory minimum for his admitted cocaine and marijuana use in the past
8465440 if hed been caught with marijuana as a young man barack obama today would be barry the janitor
8465441 we were able to take those students by another bus to their homes so the students were unfortunately were able probably to see the wreckage
8465442 the individual was trapped underneath the bus for a period of time
8465443 the bus had the right of way we believe the bus was operating in the posted speed limit and the crash was probably unavoidable
8465444 quiero invitar a mis colegas de gobierno al se or presidente a que saquen una bandera blanca a que en un momento donde nos acusan de cosas injustas lo aceptemos por la dignidad del cargo manejemos la situacion con concordia y demos el ejemplo que el 80 por ciento de los colombianos respaldan

8465450 hago un llamado a los partidos a que no piensen en las pr ximas elecciones sino en las pr ximas generaciones hago un llamado a que tengamos un seminario de discusi n a que en vez de buscar el objetivo inmediato de hacerle da o al gobierno o tratar de tumbar un ministro esperar que la justicia actue
8465451 este gobierno responde por cada uno de sus hechos y sus palabras
8465452 what they did here is particularly insidious they used the police department to send in undercover officers posing as patients and they were told by the district attorney and police chief to lie
8465453 they came in there knowing that they could find no crime so that investigation was to ensure they could stop medical marijuana
8465454 thats an abuse of discretion thats bad faith and its another indication that what is happening here is not the pursuit of justice but a pursuit of a personal agenda by law enforcement
8465455 where it becomes an issue is should the state be used to enforce federal criminal law and typically they dont

8465458 the strength of the american financial system is the diversity and that no single bank or no single group of banks is really that large
8465459 the bottom line is financial institutions are still asking for more capital
8465460 theres still plenty of capital out there so theyre looking for somewhere to park that money
8465461 walang sinasabing binabasbasan yan hindi siyempre papahintulutan sapagkat di maaari na bibigyan natin ng pahintulot na gumawa ng armadong grupo na hindi naman member ng armed forces kaya huwag tayo maniwala yan may kapahintulutan sa awtoridad there is no blessing from us and we will not allow it because it is not a member of the armed forces so let us not believe claims that the ilaga has our blessings
8465462 pag yan ang process bibigyan ng kapahintulutan sila makahawak ng armas o mabigyan ng lisensya pero di sila maaring on their own sasabihin cvo at makatulong sa pagdepensa ng komunidad nila if it goes through the proper processes its members will be allowed to carry weapons but it cannot act on its own and claim it is a cvo that will defend its villages
8465463 kung magkakaroon man ng ganito dapat naaayon sa batas may mga batas tayo na sumasaklaw sa pagaarmas if they want to defend their villages we have laws for it
8465464 but its not really a risk inherent in the single parent family per se you cant assume that every child raised by a single parent is going to have difficulties the majority dont
8465465 their concerns were driven by a lot of cultural assumptions which led them to propose kids are better off in the traditional family
8465466 the evidence on the whole hasnt supported that but the beliefs have persisted in society
8465467 those who grow up with single mothers with adequate socioeconomic resources tend to do well the children of poor single mothers are more at risk
8465468 many of the results that say that kids are at increased risk for negative outcomes have to do with economics
8465469 whats important is not whether they are raised by one or two parents its how good is the relationship with the parent how much support theyre getting from that parent and how harmonious is the environment
8465470 in the case of obama his mother was not particularly well off though she was well resourced intellectually and had been to college and had supportive parents
8465471 we see constantly children of single parent families who thrive because the parents are so devoted because theyre compensating for the absence of the other parent
8465472 that boys in particular need fathers in the way girls need mothers
8465473 i can tell you theres almost no evidence supporting that
8465474 for a variety of reasons children who grow up with single fathers for example are at higher risk than those who grow up with single mothers for either sex
8465475 phelps was born with a gift that his mother nurtured
8465476 a search of the address in derbyshire is under way and is expected to take several days
8465477 its been an honor and privilege to work for the oakland county sheriffs office
8465478 they continue to be a tremendous support system to the individuals who are deployed around the world and their families
8465479 knowing that our families are taken care of at home allows us to more effectively focus on the mission at hand
8465480 i will always be in debt to the oakland county sheriffs office and its employees for providing my family with the assistance they did while i was deployed
8465481 my expectation would be that we will have another minority i think thats the reality of the current political environment
8465482 i think anyone getting a majority in the current political alignment we have in canada would be unlikely
8465483 it certainly will give whoever wins that election hopefully ourselves that mandate to proceed and to proceed quite aggressively for some period of time
8465484 its important if possible to verify my analysis with the other opposition leaders if theres an election i think its important to give all the parties a chance to prepare
8465485 the us is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in the dprk democratic peoples republic of korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq
8465486 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities
8465487 the united states will not take north korea off the state sponsor of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for koreas nuclear program
8465488 it certainly is in violation of its commitments to the six party framework certainly in violation of the principle of action for action
8465489 this sudden move was not entirely unexpectable as the us has irked north korea by delaying the removal of north korea from the list of terrorism sponsoring states and south korea and the us did the joint military drill which was seen as a threat to the north
8465490 i do not believe that north korea whole heartedly said they will go back to the starting point in terms of denuclearization process i see it as another card at the negotiation table to urge the us to remove it from the terrorism blacklist as soon as possible
8465491 volumes will remain thin and investors are likely to stay on the sidelines till a clearer picture emerges on the political front
8465492 0 and then on to positive numbers 5 is crowned amp visible and soon to be birthed

8465496 alright i dont have anything to hide so i will
8465497 yeah right youre just trying to scare me i know its negative let me see
8465498 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8465499 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8465500 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8465501 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8465502 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8465503 i wouldnt focus on toys either because our development has been in categories you wouldnt normally think of
8465504 entertainment and toys is the go to gimmee because those are the categories that first embraced virtual worlds but if you look back at coca cola there are other categories looking at these things
8465505 we were much more focused on the creative services end now were focused on the upfront strategic business case
8465506 were not just looking at the world on its own but taking a holistic approach to the reshaping and defining of the physical product to realign it with the virtual product strategy to make sure it doesnt fall into me tooism there are so many of these youth virtual worlds coming into the market place that it becomes key to figure out what the link is between that offline and online mode
8465507 these companies are coming to us a lot more earlier even before theyve developed or shipped a product to make sure the design works together
8465508 one thing we notice when talking to our clients is that they really need to understand the roi before they can get approval from upper management and then go ahead with it
8465509 were really talking to these brands early on to help them with internal decisions
8465510 smaller toy manufacturers coming to us and asking how we become the next generation of webkinz
8465511 this is what were doing looking at the lay of the land in the industry market opportunity competitors and strategy before anyone comes to us to build
8465512 we put all that together into a plan for them its generally a pretty substantial process
8465513 zwinky has got about 16 million registered users and between 6 7 million monthly uniques spending about 80 minutes average visit as we do more and more the audience responds really well
8465514 one of the things we were seeing was a huge number of tween girls that we were forced to drive away each day
8465515 doing this coming from a big multimedia conglomerate we have such excellent relationships with people in movies music and entertainment were absolutely going to leverage those relationships to bring in partners that are relevant
8465516 when we do promotions with celebrities its really more about the user experience and providing value to them the advertising we do in zwinky is a lot of fun its the type of brand engagement you have but this is a little different we want to certainly be a lot more careful with brands and engagement that we put in front of this audience
8465517 were looking toward retail maybe next year as a great way to bring personalities in
8465518 for example not that well necessarily go this way girls love pop stars in the retail world you get a doll or a guitar and theres a type of play you expect offline then maybe you bring that online and you can access special activities and rock out on that guitar or play games that only pop stars can play or have access to special areas of the world that only you and other pop stars can access thats the personalities style were looking at
8465519 at this age youre starting to use the computer a little more by yourselves and we wanted it to be about self expression and personality
8465520 i feel like if you go younger it would be a little more about education and parental help youre sitting on moms lap
8465521 the idea is that when you come into the world there are these bubbles to get you acclimated because were dealing with a younger audience
8465522 we try to create a very friendly ui where everything revolves around the left pane and the right you can go to locations by clicking on them or just one of the buttons on the left the idea being that if youre dealing with someone on the older age they may find it easier to read and just click on pool if its the six year old they may be much more visual and click on the pool itself so we have that as well
8465523 a big part of the world and something weve seen a ton of success with in zwinky is the avatar customization
8465524 weve got a very well received way of doing that though weve obviously customized that for the younger set unlike other worlds where youre really in a model of an an animal or something here you can really change it up in every way you want
8465525 weve done a couple of focus groups we had some 8 and 10 year old girls come in and tell us how they play online so much of it led back to this idea of customization and personalization and giving them that freedom and interaction with pets you care for them feed them play with them theres so many to choose from so it plays into that idea of expressing yourself if you identify with it the difference between a dog cat goldfish penguin really really opens it up
8465526 as a senator he has shown his independence on several issues but on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years a philosophy we never had a real chance to see in action until 2001
8465527 i did not have sexual relations with that woman ms
8465528 they thought i was too young and experienced to lead a country
8465529 i hope a democrat doesnt win more tax breaks for the poor great idea lets just give them everything wait throw in some free health care as well doesnt this already exist its called communism and it doesnt work
8465530 oh she didnt say that hes ready to be commander in chief
8465531 ive just agreed to write a movie for sony and producer scott rudin about how facebook was invented i figured a good first step in my preparation would be finding out what facebook is so ive started this page actually it was started by my researcher ian reichbach because my grandmother has more internet savvy than i do and shes been dead for 33 years i honestly dont know how this works which is why im here if anyone has any questions id be happy to answer them as best i can if anyone has any comments im glad to listen and if anyone has any facebook stories i think they might be helpful

8465585 i still see her future as the president of the united states
8465586 she will be a moral leader and a political force in the senate and the nation
8465587 no other senator comes back to that body with 18 million votes with a core of enthusiastic supporters and more than a million names on her e mail list
8465588 she should go back to the senate in the fall and just do her job
8465589 she could be governor of new york or i would like to see her on the supreme court

8465599 the gallup daily is the worst thing thats happened in journalism in 20 years
8465600 we are issuing the cards to crack down on the behavioural problems we have had in cricket on the gold coast the last few seasons
8465601 although acceptable there are levels of sledging that are not acceptable like when it gets personal
8465602 theres gamesmanship and you do what you can to distract or get at a player as a fielder you make comments about their batting
8465603 thats normal in australia but there are levels that are unacceptable like when you start getting personal or racist
8465604 the reality is a breach of the code is a breach of the code
8465605 its not for the umpire to become judge and jury he is a witness but by issuing a yellow card he is also prosecutor
8465606 better behaviour can be conducted some other way by getting better captains to lead the players
8465607 where the problem lies is that clubs dont pick the right captains captains are responsible at all times for ensuring the play is conducted within the spirit of the game as well as within the laws
8465608 i want to assure all and sundry that i revisited the invincibles tape a week ago and i was delighted to hear doug ring say that there was not one word out of line on the cricket field in 1948
8465609 an army captain came to me and told me his company was divided and short of ammo

8465626 this election is gonna be like the election of 1980 that people decided that they didnt want a republican in the white house

8465631 above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
8465632 women tend to get addicted to prescription drugs like sedatives and tranquillisers more often than men do because doctors prescribe them to women more freely
8465633 women have long been seen by the medical profession as hysterical and anxious so rather than listening to the womans problem some doctors will just write a prescription for medication
8465634 everybody is out there for one reason thats to try to get to october

8465639 he had a problem for the first leg with liege and when he went away with england for the friendly last week against the czech republic we talked with the doctor yesterday and today and it was decided that steven would play in this match with the pain but now we will have to get the situation solved

8465643 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8465644 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8465645 2 do the work 2 cause the trouble the rest eat the food
8465646 ill meet you guys the next time you go out
8465647 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side
8465648 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8465649 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8465650 the greatest way we can honor the life work of del martin is to continue to fight and never give up until we have achieved equality for all
8465651 we would not have marriage equality in california if it werent for del and phyllis they fought and triumphed in many battles
8465652 through it all their love and commitment to each other was an inspiration to all who knew them
8465653 ultimately it gets down to self acceptance if you accept yourself you dont give a damn what anyone else thinks
8465654 no secret anymore the times of del martin and phyllis lyon
8465655 when joe bidens brother and son wanted to buy a hedge fund company two years ago they turned for financing to a law firm that had lobbied the delaware senators office on an important piece of business in congress and in fact had just benefited from his vote

8465665 it was a mistake he really is alive amp hell really be ok
8465666 how many at invesco field will be there because theyve been coerced heres a true example

8465679 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8465680 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8465681 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8465682 robot ini bisa menggantikan manusia untuk mengintai kekuatan dan posisi musuh tanpa berisiko terlihat atau diketahui lawan
8465683 kami ingin tentara yang bertugas di lapangan makin aman dan keselamatan mereka terlindungi
8465684 proyek ini membuat saya sering ke lapangan dan menghabiskan waktu di alam terbuka kadang selama berhari hari menyempurnakan saturn
8465685 pada proofing event pembuktian produk yang berlangsung selama lima hari kami sempat khawatir karena sampai hari ketiga komunikasi antara stasiun pengendali di darat dan robot kendaraan tidak begitu bagus
8465686 berbagai proyek yang saya ikuti hampir semuanya memiliki kaitan dengan pertahanan
8465687 inilah yang membuat saya senang dan menikmati bidang saya ada hasil nyata yang bisa dimanfaatkan untuk kepentingan manusia
8465688 yesterday is history tomorrow is a mystery but today is a gift that is why it is called the present
8465689 the secretary of state provides us the language and we accept it
8465690 if someone doesnt like that they need to take it to some other forum
8465691 it is your obligation to ensure that voters are presented with a fair and honest description of this important ballot issue
8465692 what does obama bring to the table specifically i paraphrase
8465693 he was a great leader in the illinois state legislature
8465694 how to sell customer experience to your execs and upper managers
8465695 if there was any deep division in the music scene in 1977 it wasnt people scratching their heads at less than stellar releases from kansas foreigner styx or steely dan and neil young it was the demise of live music as disco came to prominence i could make the argument that kansas nugent and other arena acts gained fans because people who hated disco really hated disco myself included
8465696 john jansens comments made me think of some of the bad things white people have done timothy mcveigh terry nichols the unabomber not to mention almost all the serial killers in the u s and all those arab terrorists theyre caucasian i just dont think we can afford to have white people running this country they are way too dangerous
8465697 i really used to be amazed how these individuals could be so blatant about who they really are and yet have their assemblies still pour money into their pockets so they can live like movie stars and then you have those who are of the new faith cashians and followers of santa christ
8465698 i only discovered i had investment conflicts through the mail
8465699 i sponsored dozens of my own bills in one year and passed them in the illinois state senate
8465700 no one from my campaign discussed nafta with anyone in
8465701 i believe in every vote counting i support the peoples vote as their voice
8465702 daddy its not a motorcycle its just a regular number eight bike
8465703 daddy daddy erins driving the fire truck daddy daddy shes driving it
8465704 together we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8465705 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8465706 they can and have sent a great message of unity and the stakes involved in this election
8465707 all the americans who arent as hard core democrats as we
8465708 as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on some very important issues
8465709 but on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy that has defined his party for more than 25 years
8465710 youve got bill clinton supporters and youve got hillary supporters
8465711 the people that are really loyal to bill clinton wont listen as much to hillary and vice versa
8465712 she certainly did very well in the primaries but he was elected president twice and he had the support of republicans and independents
8465713 people look back at that in a very positive way and with very fond memories and he can evoke the possibilities of a future with a president obama and do it with a lot of credibility
8465714 he is still young enough he is going to have a lot of good years ahead of him he just has to quit pressing
8465715 when he has a night like that he is going to hear it from the crowd
8465716 thats the way it works id rather have him than not have him
8465717 every year there are one or two baseball teams that get racked by injuries
8465718 i dont think we are going to have another season like this injury wise and that is a good thing
8465719 there is going to be a lot going on this offseason
8465720 its a huge step forward on the new road of making that alaska gas pipeline a reality
8465721 we have north americas premier independent pipeline company working with us now
8465722 whatever we can to put forth an attractive commercial proposal
8465723 mattel has pursued this case first and foremost as a matter of principle
8465724 we have an obligation to defend ourselves against competitors who choose to engage in fraudulent activities against us
8465725 we are thrilled that this jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the marketplace and not the courtroom
8465726 under the constitution the defendant has a right to go to trial within certain time limits if they are not brought to a jury trial within those time limits their case would be dismissed
8465727 its absolutely bothersome and it does represent a true danger to our community
8465728 weve had felons their cases dismissed weve had child molestation cases dismissed armed robberies domestic violence cases dismissed so these are all very serious matters
8465729 we dont have enough judges in riverside county to hear all of the criminal cases that we have and the judges that we do have in riverside county have not been prioritized to hear criminal trials
8465730 most of the cases that have been dismissed through this problem have been low grade misdemeanors where the individuals are not in custody on those felonies that have been dismissed the d a immediately re files those charges and those individuals have remained in custody
8465731 it is definitely a fiscal issue there are presently seven unfunded judicial positions for riverside county those seven judges alone could try approximately 280 criminal trials in a year that would more than resolve the dismissal issue
8465732 it was hard for me to tell anybody because in the beginning its i dont want anyone to know about this its my way of losing weight i dont want to tell anyone because if anyone found out about it it would be taken away from me
8465733 so they are getting very very sick in a sense slow starvation but they are losing weight rapidly but its very dangerous
8465734 i have been on the alert for this and so i look for signs i look for the young woman mentioning she is concerned about her weight her body image her self esteem
8465735 i see little effects here and there but ive met other girls with diabulimia see other girls that are blind have organ failure are at risk of losing their life because of the desire to be thin and it all stems from not taking our insulin i would say its not worth it love yourself there are people that love you and fight
8465736 we already know that eating disorders without diabetes raise the risk of death in the context of another chronic medical illness its another shocker or jolt
8465737 the body is literally eating away at itself when you burn this bodily tissue you wind up with diabetic ketoacidosis which can be fatal
8465738 doled out tens of thousands of dollars to charities among them jeremiah wrights trinity united church of christ obamas church and the arab american action network
8465739 he located a job closer to my job so that we could still work in the same vicinity of each other and then just carpool together said cowan
8465740 its like 28 miles one way to get to work now versus him driving the extra 30 miles
8465741 how much you drive is a crucial factor in how much you get charged for auto insurance
8465742 if people drive fewer miles they get into fewer accidents its that simple
8465743 our estimate is that people who are cutting back in major ways should be able to save between 10 and 15 percent on their auto insurance premiums
8465744 most companies look at whether you drive fewer than 10 000 miles a year or more than 10 000 miles per year so if youre cutting back and it takes you down below that 10 000 mile limit you likely could save some money
8465745 place an immediate call to your insurer or your agent and offer to document it if they wish
8465746 we can do extra things with our family as far as going out to eat taking vacations to visit family and things like that
8465747 and on that path to freedom harriett tubman had one piece of advice
8465748 perhaps you should research mr franks record a little more
8465749 shes using my daughter people never even knew who samantha ronson was until she met lindsay she was just some l a dj and now shes writing a book i am at wits end with this stuff this is not in lindsays best interest
8465750 hes out of control i want him to stop hurting and talking to the media celebrity gossip juicy celebrity rumors hollywood gossip blog from perez hilton
8465751 ive samantha ronson rumoured to be writing tell all book about lindsay lohan cele bitchy found this 10 hours ago on
8465752 ive been up and down the road in discussions with my ex wife dina and its to the point now that im going to confront samantha michael lohan upset about samantha ronsons tell all book im not obsessed celebrity gossip and pictures popbytes found this 9 hours ago on
8465753 samantha drinks and passes the drinks under the table to lindsay and behind the lindsay amp sams family dinner
8465754 my son had his birthday party and all his money from the birthday party was there
8465755 i had all the locks changed here that night because i didnt really want to sleep here
8465756 im glad my son wasnt home with the baby sitter
8465757 when i saw them on the news i couldnt really see them
8465758 i wanted to turn the idea of a soldier on its head and look at them as vulnerable
8465759 i wanted to look in the face of a young person who has seen something that has marked their lives
8465760 whether or not you can see that in the photograph is another matter
8465761 out of context neither in a museum setting or website the images as stand alone highway or city billboards appear to be deceased soldiers the presentation in this manner could be perceived as being disrespectful to the men and women in our armed forces
8465762 whether people are in favor of this war or any war or against it know that people get killed and that war puts people in harms way
8465763 viewing these portraits of soldiers causes one to pause and think of the many sacrifices and efforts these men and women have experienced to protect us and defend this great country the portraits are a stark reminder of the reality of it all
8465764 for me looking at their faces serves also as a reminder to remember our service men and women and to thank them for all they do and have done i am disappointed that the billboards have been canceled and strongly hope the company will reconsider
8465765 if there was any deep division in the music scene in 1977 it wasnt people scratching their heads at less than stellar releases from kansas foreigner styx or steely dan and neil young it was the demise of live music as disco came to prominence i could make the argument that kansas nugent and other arena acts gained fans because people who hated disco really hated disco myself included

8465775 i figured once i cleared waivers and there wasnt really any action that id finish out the season in atlanta
8465776 but this obviously is exciting to come to a club thats in the playoff race and especially one like boston that has the history of a great tradition
8465777 unfortunately in atlanta things didnt go as well as we would have liked i see atlanta giving me this opportunity and we have to be thankful for that as well
8465778 the one thing ive heard from numerous people is if he can walk hell play
8465779 i know that ive gotten messages from people all over the league that said hes everybodys all time favorite i know hes a real professional i know hes excited about coming here
8465780 he said hell do anything we ask to try to help us win
8465781 he adds a lot to our club hes a plus defensively in center and in right he plays first base he has great instincts hes really a gamer hes the type you want up in a big spot hell help this club on the field and in the clubhouse
8465782 id have to say its my weirdest night as a professional in the big leagues
8465783 so we had a lot of background on him he has a lot of upside thats what you strive for in a trade like this
8465784 hes going to be a great addition hes one of those leader type guys
8465785 just day to day were going to keep checking be smart with it

8465800 were just dealing with it the best way we can i dont think we can do anything different
8465801 even though hes scheduled to pitch friday we are evaluating on a day to day basis
8465802 the key is not to let guys play when theyre in a vulnerable state
8465803 a citizen sees the beating in a parking lot police get there fast they see him beating her its a good solid case
8465804 he was on top of her actually in the act of violently beating her when the officers arrived with the knife in his hand

8465812 about 20 civilians were killed three days ago due to heavy fighting in piagapo town but we cant tell whether these were results of direct attacks by the rebels or collateral damage by the bombing and shelling by military forces
8465813 it is these rogue milf members who are behind burning of houses and murder of innocent civilians
8465814 theres no comprehensive plan of action this situation must be treated as a national concern of crisis proportions
8465815 there must be awareness on the part of government of the seriousness of the humanitarian and human rights situation as the number of internally displaced people are increasing day by day
8465816 candidate mccain now supports the wartime tax cuts that senator mccain once denounced as immoral candidate mccain criticizes senator mccains own climate change bill candidate mccain says he would now vote against the immigration bill that senator mccain wrote are you kidding talk about being for it before you were against it
8465817 let me tell you before he ever debates barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself
8465818 known and been friends with john mccain for almost 22 years

8465820 a failure to consistently use the power of diplomacy from the middle east to africa to latin america to center and eastern europe
8465821 are you kidding talk about being for it before youre against it
8465822 to those who still believe in the myth of a maverick instead of the reality of a politician i say lets compare senator mccain to candidate mccain
8465823 let me tell you before he ever debates barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself
8465824 i dont at all like knowing what people say of me behind my back it makes me far too conceited

8465826 hon bill english can the prime minister tell the house whether her coalition partner new zealand first has advised her whether owen glenn is the mystery anonymous donor who placed nearly 100 000 in the new zealand first bank account last year and if not does she intend to ask new zealand first in order to find out whether a donation may have affected winston peters consideration of who to appoint as consul to monaco hon dr michael cullen no i cannot advise that nor can i advise the house of any of the anonymous donors to the national party because they were all funded through something called the waitemata trust some 2 3 million which was handled by a man whom that government appointed to chair government quangos and boards what is more the national party still will not tell us who their anonymous donors were let me finally add that anybody who thinks the appointment as an honorary consul is some kind of plum job does not know that most honorary consuls spend more than the amount of money which is 5 000 plus 7 500 in expenses that we give to them mr glenn who is a billionaire has supposedly thought this was some plum financial reward but he has really got on hard times very fast hon bill english does the prime minister have confidence in the ability of her coalition partner new zealand first to clear up the issue of the large anonymous donation that suddenly appeared in its bank account late last year when dail jones has said it happened winston peters has said that dail jones is completely wrong and that owen glenn was not the anonymous donor but owen glenns pr company will not say whether he was the donor hon dr michael cullen the prime minister is not responsible for any donations that may have been given to any other political party she would however welcome the opportunity to become responsible for that and look into the national partys anonymous donations
8465827 whether her coalition partner new zealand first has advised her
8465828 of course thats a little tougher for labour to do than national because labour wants to pass the ets and has been relying on nzf coming on board
8465829 but the question will linger why did peters behave the way he has there was nothing illegal or wrong in the glenn donation so why did he deny it so firmly when he should have at least suspected there had been a donation
8465830 winston didnt do anything illegal or immoral it isnt the prime ministers business there isnt any evidence we need to give him a chance
8465831 we dont like winston what he stands for never have hope he doesnt last much longer but the price of being in government is sometimes having to form coalitions with people we dont really like that much
8465832 look owen glenn says he did give money i dont know why he would make that up the media will get hold of that at some point so dont dig a bigger hole for yourself by accusing the media of lying if this problem doesnt go away soon and if there are any further allegations coming out then i will suspend you and set up an independent inquiry so pull your head in
8465833 but don t joke us all around she didn t inform us today for the reason of cutting him loose she told us today because she knew there was a chance that owen glenn might tell the priviliges committee that she knew all along it looks far better for her to tell the public now rather that it to be released during a video conference with owen glenn
8465834 i am really not in a position to adjudicate i am in the position where an honourable members word has been given and its been given in parliament as well as in many other places

8465898 john mccain has served his country with honor but his refusal to change course even in the face of the failed policies of bush cheney is reckless and will not keep us safe
8465899 to restore americas standing to what it was eight years ago
8465900 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8465901 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8465902 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win
8465903 made it clear that a governor has a mandatory obligation to issue a writ of election when a congressional seat is vacated

8465906 probably the second most important gathering that we will be at for the future of this country other than the things that happen at the convention hall

8465924 youre in a much better place now than you were two years ago
8465925 well looks like a white male in his late 30s no sign of a struggle its the damdest thing
8465926 take a look at his body you see that he was stabbed in the neck with a baguette
8465927 the dude was killed with bread gives new meaning to the term yeast infection eh
8465928 what did you say the name of that bread loaf was a baguette what the fuck is a baguette
8465929 a baguette is a variety of bread distinguishable by its much greater length than width and noted for its very crispy crust the standard girth size of a baguette is approx 5 or 6 cm but can be up to a meter in length it typically weighs 8 8 oz though it can be larger where not regulated by law it is also known in english as a french stick or a french loaf
8465930 damn man did you just pull that out of your ass or what at first i thought you were describing a male porn stars cock
8465931 oh yeah well please sherlock tell me more about the murder weapon
8465932 the baguette is a descendant of the bread developed in vienna in the mid 19th century when steam ovens were first brought into use helping to make possible the crisp crust and the white crumb pitted with holes that still distinguish the modern baguette long loaves had been made for some time but in october 1920 a law prevented bakers from working before 4 a m making it impossible to make the traditional often round loaf in time for customers breakfasts the slender baguette solved the problem because it could be prepared and baked much more rapidly
8465933 yes baguettes are closely connected to france and especially to paris though they are made around the world in france not all long loaves are baguettes for example a short loaf is a b tard a standard thicker stick is a fl te also known in the united states as a parisienne and a thinner loaf is a ficelle french breads are also made in forms such as a miche which is a large pan loaf and a boule which is a round loaf similar to some peasant breads
8465934 fascinating is there a particular way to enjoy a baguette aside from sticking it in a guys throat and killing him
8465935 i think being a crime scene investigator isnt your calling you need to be a baker
8465936 that reminds me of a joke involving baguettes its said that french law bans you from walking more than seven paces from a bakery without pinching and tasting a just bought baguette the joke states that the penalty for this offense is unknown because it is a law no one has ever been able to break
8465937 uh huh on second thought dont quit your day job clearly you werent meant to be a comedian with material like that can you tell what type of bread it is in that baguette sticking out of the guys neck
8465938 ow fuck i just cut the roof of my goddamn mouth shit these things are sharp when they get hard
8465939 i think you need to be more concerned with the fact you just broke off and ate bread sticking out of a dead guys throat i think that could be labeled as tampering with evidence
8465940 oh i think its a french baguette i taste it through the blood in my mouth does that help the investigation
8465941 you may be a criminal wolfe but im a law abiding citizen dont paint me with your black brush
8465942 the u s code which contains all federal statutes occupies 56 009 single spaced pages its 47 volumes take up nine feet of shelf space an annotated version which attempts to bring order out of chaos is three feet long and has 230 hardcover volumes and 36 paperback supplements administrative lawmaking under statutes fill up the 207 volume code of federal regulations which spans 21 feet of shelf space and contains more than 134 488 pages of regulatory law federal law is further augmented by more than 2 756 volumes of judicial precedent taking up 160 yards of law library shelving
8465943 federal agencies issued more than 25 000 new regulations criminalizing everything from reliable toilets to snuff advertisements on race cars
8465944 people pardon me journalists and politicians have often accused me of believing that im above the law and yet who isnt the law is created by demonstrable criminals enforced by demonstrable criminals interpreted by demonstrable criminals all for demonstrably criminal purposes of course im above the law and so are you

8465954 the senate is currently conducting an internal investigation in an attempt to discover who is behind this once we learn their identity that information will be turned over to law enforcement and we would expect it to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law
8465955 we really dont celebrate the misfortune and sentence of anybody but we do celebrate the law the system we live in and we do feel justice has prevailed in this case
8465956 this is the advice i got from an artist friend back in college
8465957 just tell me how it makes you feel i dont give a shit about the rest i dont need you to give me lesson in artistic theory do you connect with it and how so or why not

8465960 in addition increases in the frequency of spanking are associated with increased odds of abuse and mothers who report spanking on the buttocks with an object such as a belt or a switch are nine times more likely to report abuse compared to mothers who report no spanking with an object
8465961 this study demonstrated for the first time that parents who report spanking children with an object and parents who frequently spank children are much more likely to report other harsh punishment acts consistent with physical abuse
8465962 striking a child with an object is unacceptable and may be dangerous
8465963 im confident the president has the votes to stay if he would choose
8465964 however i know the president cares deeply about the institution and hes assured me that he wants some resolution to this issue and he will put the interest of the university above his own
8465965 the board of trustees has not involved me in any discussion regarding a meeting tomorrow morning i really dont know whats going on at this point nothing would surprise me
8465966 the board is having a meeting in the morning to sit down with the president and figure out how to get this behind us
8465967 with the credit crunch squeezing household budgets people can ill afford this extra tax grab its dishonest and unjust for politicians to wrap revenue raising tax hikes in a green banner
8465968 the government is talking about raising taxes even further but our conclusions show that green taxes should be kept as they are or cut
8465969 higher and rising inflation is having an effect on pay negotiations in the private sector but pressure on profits is also a key part of the picture as the economic outlook worsens
8465970 the government is on the verge of making a massive costly and hugely damaging mistake that will destabilise the criminal justice system for years to come
8465971 giant us style prisons may be easier to build but all the evidence here and abroad says the price we would pay in running them and in higher re offending rates is far too high if ministers want prisons to be focused on rehabilitation rather than warehousing offenders until they are released then it is not too late to make these plans disappear as fast as they appeared
8465972 i didnt hear cunningham give any kind of order i didnt see him there
8465973 i thought oh no as i put two and two together
8465974 creating 3d maps and worlds can be extremely labor intensive and time consuming also the final result might not be all that accurate or realistic a new technique developed by scientists at the university of manchesters school of computer science and dolby canada however might make capturing depth and textures for 3d surfaces as simple as shooting two pictures with a digital camera one with flash and one without first an image of a surface is captured without flash the problem is that the different colors of a surface also reflect light differently making it difficult to determine if the brightness difference is a function of depth or color by taking a second photo with flash however the accurate colors of all visible portions of the surface can be captured the two captured images essentially become a reflectance map albedo and a depth map height field
8465975 meet the space cube the worlds smallest fully functional pc primarily designed for use in space it somehow manages to cram a working pc with usb ports card readers audio outputs and proprietary interfaces into a tiny cube chassis measuring just two inches square it runs a basic linux front end which the blogger takes a look at and there are some great photos of the device being loomed over by everyday objects like coffee mugs and cellphones it has connections for controlling various electronics used by esa nasa and jaxa but it will also apparently be for sale to the public soon for use by amateur engineers and robotics clubs

8465977 barack obama is ready to lead america barack obama is the man for this job
8465978 my candidate didnt win but i am really proud of the campaign she ran she never quit
8465979 i am greatful for the chance to go all over america to tell people about the person i know and love
8465980 our nation is in trouble on two fronts the american dream is under seas at home and the leadership in the world has been weakened the job of the next president is to rebuild the american dream and restore american leadership in the world
8465981 thanks but no thanks john mccain cares about our country but he does not understand the two issues that stand at the core of this election
8465982 this incident is yet another reminder of how dependent air travel in this country is on an antiquated air traffic control system airline passengers are sick and tired of delays and cancellations its time we overhauled the system as president i will work to deploy the next generation air traffic control system and order the faa to work in the interim to minimize disruptions like the one we experienced today
8465983 the news that the federal aviation administration has experienced a communications failure that has delayed flights across the eastern united states is yet another example of washington failing the american people it once again highlights the need to reform and repair a broken system while we still do not know the full extent of todays problems we do know that unless action is taken now the breakdowns of today will become all too common in the future
8465984 this is the second time in less than two years that we have seen a massive computer failure that has grounded thousands of flights across the country ensuring that passengers are kept flying safely and efficiently should be one of our nations top priorities how many times do we have to see these type of total system break downs before our government steps in to do something
8465985 congress has made great strides in coming up with an faa reauthorization bill that would upgrade this antiquated technology and ensure passengers basic rights but now we need to finish the job before financing expires on september 30 and we have to start all over from scratch we urge lawmakers to pass this important legislation and ensure that passengers everywhere have access to basic rights and recourses when traveling
8465986 this most recent failure of the faa computer system has effected every flight and every airport in the country today obviating the need for congress to stop kicking the can down the road and pass the faa modernization bill now before congress the faa reauthorization bill has already been delayed one year and now congress still has not finished the job through the senate will it take a catastrophic event before congress shores up our infrastructure in a meaningful way
8465987 i feel vindicated i feel great that i am back
8465988 but were not here to judge and were certainly not here simply to euthanize dogs our job is to protect the public safety
8465989 we understand that mr mcgahey is not abusive and that forrest has posed no danger but the dog got out twice and thats a violation of the ordinance
8465990 and there have been no deaths or maulings by pit bulls since the ordinance went into effect
8465991 theyre fellow athletes in bergen county you dont expect something like that to happen when youre doing something fun like playing football it shouldnt be life or death
8465992 its just in the back of your head that it could happen to you
8465993 as players we need to know our own limits and the coaches need to know them too
8465994 if it had such an effect on me and my coaches when we only had such limited details it will have an effect on the kids you cant be wrong by discussing it
8465995 you really cant be prepared for something like this and that worries you as a coach you pray that you never have to experience something like that as coach or as a parent
8465996 we always tell them if you feel dizzy if you feel light headed you can take yourself out of a drill the coaches arent going to hold anything against you
8465997 i dont remember any kid saying that could have been me
8465998 thats because nothing happened on the field the boy passed out and was unconscious on the sideline the kids were emotionally hurt by it
8465999 his name was john oneill and i still think about him i had a relationship with him in class too it was a sad thing definitely an emotional thing for a coach
8466000 i think my oldest would realize that this isnt necessarily football related
8466001 i think he understands the risk of injury but i dont think anyone goes there thinking of the risk of death if you went out there thinking like that im not sure anyone would be able to play
8466002 the first thing i look at is that im a father of three boys
8466003 two of them are playing tackle football my first thing from a parents perspective is oh my god what if that was my kid
8466004 secondly as a coach well jeez i happened to be very near the baseball field here in wayne when 12 year old steven domalewski got hit by that line drive and his heart briefly stopped beating it certainly had a big effect on me to see something like that happen obviously in football theres a risk for something of that magnitude to happen
8466005 theyre fellow athletes in bergen county you dont expect something like that to happen when youre doing something fun like playing football it shouldnt be life or death
8466006 its just in the back of your head that it could happen to you
8466007 as players we need to know our own limits and the coaches need to know them too

8466011 i dont remember any kid saying that could have been me

8466024 barack obamas father was muslim and therefore according to islamic law so is the candidate in spite of the koranic verses explaining that there is no compulsion in religion a muslim child takes the religion of his or her father for muslims around the world non american muslims at any rate they can only ever see barack hussein obama as a muslim
8466025 obama may not want to be counted as a muslim but muslims are eager to count him as one of their own
8466026 he has to be good for arabs because he is a muslim
8466027 he cant be a christian his middle name is hussein
8466028 the symbolism of a major american presidential candidate with the middle name of hussein who went to elementary school in indonesia
8466029 dont really understand obamas family tree but what they do know is that if america despite being attacked by muslim militants on 9 11 were to elect as its president some guy with the middle name hussein it would mark a sea change in america muslim world relations

8466055 hitler wanted a whiter than white society it had no place for blacks asians or anyone else the one thing that you can say about the f hrer is that he was an equal opportunity hater
8466056 the nazis liked to demonise blacks in the way that bigots of the deep south in america did it was all part of the desensitising of the german race in the nazi effort to convince them they were the chosen people
8466057 the nazis collated names and addresses but there was no separate register for blacks we honour both those who died and those who survived

8466077 stephen harper and his government should return to face the house of commons before an election is called mr harper must show some serious regard for the fixed election date reform he himself introduced only two years ago the prime minister is asking to meet with the leaders of the opposition parties by next week in order to determine whether he has support for his governments fall agenda depending on the answers he receives he could advise micha lle jean the governor general to dissolve parliament a federal election has become desirable but there is no urgency or necessity mr harper should respect and work within customary parliamentary procedures
8466078 will the pm get away with his risky election gambit
8466079 some will interpret mr harpers gambit as another example of his brilliant strategic sense others will say hes taken dictatorial liberties too far judging by the hundreds of e mails posted in response to the developments theres a pretty even split with partisans of each party hollering at each other the way they usually do the harper people are confident that accusations of duplicity will not haunt them that when the election is under way stories about what prompted it are quickly forgotten though the aftertaste will linger for some they are probably correct in that surmise
8466080 you should at least meet the canadian house of commons when it returns on september 15 prime minister and try things out for a bit longer
8466081 its looking like a win win win for harper if he wants an election and gov gen michaelle jean refuses his request hell have a constitutional crisis to champion against a meddlesome monarchy overstepping its bounds

8466091 hillary would have been better but barack is the best man for the job
8466092 yes he can but first we have to elect him
8466093 id like to see the words made in america again
8466094 i want everybody to now understand why i am so proud to have joe biden and the whole biden family
8466095 i think hes presented himself pretty well so far what do you think
8466096 no longer will the eight most dreaded words in the english language be the vice presidents office is on the phone
8466097 i know it you know it barack obama gets it
8466098 this is the time as americans together we get back up
8466099 these are extraordinary times this is an extraordinary election the american people are ready barack obama is ready this is his time this is our time this is americas time
8466100 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8466101 ive been on the ground in georgia iraq pakistan and afghanistan and i can tell you in no uncertain terms this administrations policy has been an abject failure
8466102 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8466103 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8466104 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8466105 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8466106 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8466107 be there because barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8466108 joe biden is right we need more than a good soldier we need a leader with the experience and judgment to serve as commander in chief from day one that leader is john mccain
8466109 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8466110 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
8466111 it also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet
8466112 while no one promised him the job we were under the impression he would be given a better opportunity to win it if theyre going to base it off two days of kicking they probably shouldnt have signed him it makes no sense to make a decision about jay without letting him kick in the preseason game
8466113 had we known he wasnt even going to get that chance we never would have signed with the chiefs
8466114 the turtle lives twixt plated decks that practically conceal its sex i think it clever of the turtle in such a fix to be so fertile

8466119 the reduction in the underlying business performance of the gold coast parks can mostly be attributed to extended poor weather which covered all the major trading periods for the year including january school holidays
8466120 its a relaxing atmosphere down here in a way even better than getting on and off the bus to go out there to the pepsi center
8466121 at least i know new jerseys not the only place with gridlock
8466122 if the standard was 1980 when ted kennedy challenged a sitting democratic president jimmy carter hillary clintons doing more than her share to unite the party
8466123 at a press conference where there was one reporter and about nine pigeons
8466124 its foreign policy i think that was the one area on obamas resume that was weak and biden with his years of experience gives you that
8466125 its time to go after this guy mccain and thats also what youre going to get from biden tonight
8466126 i think hillarys speech last night helped and i think it helped today when she released her delegates to obama
8466127 why not go out on a limb thats where the fruit is
8466128 i may disagree with what you have to say but i shall defend to the death your right to say it
8466129 over in the wps op ed page david ignatius tells of his one on one interview with president bush where the two talked about iran

8466154 certainly women arent their strong suit but the daughter in american a destructive force but shes also very human shes not nice but shes very real
8466155 thats debatable and second even if its true it proves my point you can only point to one example to make your case and shes an example of woman at her most destructive
8466156 maybe i can get you on charlies show you and one of the patriarchs
8466157 in an even more dire situation than the active army but both have the same symptoms i just have a higher fever

8466176 i get a lot of people who are so surprised to hear that im finishing college theyll say something like wait it seems like just a couple of years ago you were 10 and i saw you in a junior tournament its hard for me to realize too
8466177 ive had fun all the way through college my dad told me that college and playing golf in college would be a great adventure no truer words have been spoken
8466178 im working hard on my game and ill definitely give it a try at the lpga qualifying tournament this fall
8466179 depending on how i do there ill either be playing pro golf or going to law school at least i have some options
8466180 regardless of what happens i think ill always play competitive golf
8466181 golf has been so great for me and to me and has been such a huge part of my life its kind of how i identify myself and i dont want to do away with that
8466182 tennessee was a good choice for me i liked it from the first day and it just keeps getting better
8466183 i started playing much better in the spring and i feel very positive for the year both as a team and for myself
8466184 keeping up with school work and golf can be pretty tough but most people find a way to balance things
8466185 its something that is always at least in the back of your mind
8466186 it has been kind of interesting to be at what some call the other ut and with a different shade of orange
8466187 the reality is at some point in time you will win your last tournament
8466188 with a win ive already had a good year we still have seven tournaments left in the year with one major championship quite honestly the way im playing right now i think i have a chance to really turn this into an outstanding year
8466189 i dont have that goal my goal is to play the best golf that i can for the longest period of time i can play
8466190 we were not expecting that their website be in braille or that they make any huge changes just that they designed the site in a standard way so our software would work
8466191 lots of other large corporation websites have dealt with this successfully
8466192 they did not want to talk to us about it
8466193 in 2006 many things on the website were accessible to visually impaired people and some were not
8466194 whats important is that we have been working continuously as the website and the technology have improved
8466195 target has made a positive shift to dealing with the problem
8466196 twelve houses between them two rich guys its almost like shooting fish in a bucket
8466197 a group of british professors pastors and teachers had been publishing for a number of years
8466198 ultimately the lock is ment to serve as a deterrent from people just walking by and picking it up on their way to the door while your back is turned having a lock is not a waste of money considering the price of a laptop just dont leave it out of
8466199 i had an old pair of cheapy computer speakers but my dad decided to hook them up to the once great but soon replaced television one day i was just browsing the web and like the speakers started picking up some sort of like conversation on a phone

8466201 anybody whos not on board you get rid of them
8466202 it doesnt matter if its a player or a coach or somebody in the background if youre not on board you get rid of them
8466203 if were going to be recognized as a team we have to be defensively consistent
8466204 in the past we have not been as consistent as our offense or the other great defenses in the league
8466205 coach mcneill brought a lot of excitement we didnt have in the past
8466206 we come out with so much passion now he has such a passion for the game that it affects us and makes us want to play harder
8466207 hearing that all the time starts getting under your skin
8466208 we have to prove its not just the offense thats going to be an eye opener for people
8466209 i think a lot of it is the confidence energy and excitement that ruffin and his coaches generate in some key players over there
8466210 its believing in yourself and knowing you can do it and it starts in practice
8466211 i dont think its too simplistic to say thats a big part of it
8466212 we really need to be even better at stopping the run
8466213 obviously you have to be ready to defend the pass in this league but rush defense will be a big emphasis for us
8466214 i like our veterans and we also have some newcomers that i feel good about
8466215 i also like the depth we possibly can have so i feel pretty good although theres no debating that its a tough tough league for defenses
8466216 our offense is going to do their thing and score a lot of points so before the season most people always just talk about them and theyve earned that
8466217 prudence would dictate that we leave the text as it is until our candidate catches up with us
8466218 i want to give him a platform he can run on
8466219 i dont want to stick my finger in his eye
8466220 force americans to sacrifice their way of life or trim their hopes and dreams for their children
8466221 for them to disclose this kind of information i think is significant and groundbreaking in the sense that it really could have an effect on how investors view companies with carbon risks going forward

8466229 the basic returns on vdsl beyond 5 000 feet are not quite there
8466230 the vdsl2 specs say it reaches up to 12 000 feet but the rates are just not there

8466232 youre not spending time doing atm segmentation for the last few thousand feet you can carry quality of service transparently to the customer premises device
8466233 look at all the facts and dont blame the judges because it is the easy answer
8466234 there are 121 international players from 26 countries on the lpga tour including 45 players from south korea
8466235 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8466236 this is an american tour it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8466237 i would encourage all immigrants to keep their own language and culture

8466279 smurf a roo whatever is in that cellar must be important
8466280 yup youngin were at the tail end of it right now
8466281 what grandpa means is that we may be stranded here forever
8466282 there is still a way for us to return to the smurf village
8466283 grandpas right we can put these crystals back by hand
8466284 it may take a million tries before we get the right combination
8466285 ok whats the deal here are we going home or arent we
8466286 you see i never assembled a crystal puzzle like this before
8466287 but im certain that someday i would find the proper combination
8466288 but what if the puzzle isnt put together right papa smurf
8466289 then there is no telling where we will end up
8466290 come on youngins lets get back to the village im sure the others will be real glad to see us
8466291 baffling badgers papi smurf who would do this to our home
8466292 im not sure grandpa but what ever happened here it didnt end on a positive note
8466293 papa smurf you dont suppose that gargamel finally won do you
8466294 i say we should go over to gargamels and give him what for
8466295 calm down my little smurfs we cant be certain that this was gargamels doing
8466296 we will however go to gargamels and see if we can possibly find a clue on what might have happened you you you and you will come with me to gargamels
8466297 the rest of you see if you can find any further clues to what might have happened here
8466298 gosh papa smurf looks like what ever happened to the village happened here too
8466299 oooh papa smurf who would be so cruel to burn down both our village and gargamels home
8466300 why if i ever get my hands on who ever did this ill give them a piece of my mind
8466301 im sure well get to the bottom of this my little smurfs
8466302 now lets get back to the village and see what the others have found
8466303 gosh with all the adventures we been on with these crystals this has to be the most depressing
8466304 i know what you mean clumsy yet im still trying to figure out where all those extra burnt homes came from
8466305 if memory serves me correctly this area is supposed to be an empty field instead there is burnt rubble here that seems to resemble what used to be homes
8466306 these new homes seem to reach all the way to the beach
8466307 sacrebleu what did ze smurfs do while we were away
8466308 gosh so much has changed even that rock over there seems new
8466309 well at least we now know that this is the future and we do make it home soon
8466310 well isnt it obvious this statue of hefty is carved two years from now and we know that hefty is not dead yet
8466311 galloping gophers papa smurf did you and the other smurfs find anything at papi gargamels
8466312 im afraid all we found was gargamels home burnt down to rubble
8466313 sure would like to know whats going on here papa smurf
8466314 i wonder if they found anything that might tell us what is going on
8466315 we didnt hear you coming oh look and theres hefty too smurfs its hefty
8466316 gosh its great seeing you alive hefty and not dead or anything
8466317 huh we didnt find anything but what was once the s s smurf
8466318 kind of like this statue behind grandpa and the others papa smurf
8466319 i believe snappy was talking about that statue lying there behind you brainy
8466320 but brainy we were just talking about this statue before the others showed up
8466321 hefty stops in mid sentence as soon as he recognizes the face on the statue as he scrolls down to what is left of the statue he notices a very disturbing inscription confused he turns around to face the other smurfs
8466322 i believe that this statue proves we have arrived sometime in the future papa smurf
8466323 oooh this cant be the future for hefty it just cant
8466324 well i dont plan on letting this control my life so you all can stop looking at me like that besides im not a goner yet
8466325 well smurfs from what weve all seen so far is very disturbing indeed but we must remember that the future is never really written
8466326 seeing this statue only proves that we do make it back home as soon as we get home well have to find a way to prevent any of this from happening
8466327 there has to be something we can do for him
8466328 we must try to find out what happened and save him before he um you know
8466329 its like papa smurf always said the future has not been written yet and papa smurf knows that do make it home and papa smurf
8466330 i suggest we go check out the smurf dam again young wiper smurfers
8466331 well i may not know where we are but if im not mistaken those dark clouds rolling in looks like it could rain any minute we better find shelter soon
8466332 look papa smurf there is a cave behind that water fall
8466333 yes i see it but the question is if whoever lives there will allow us to stay the night while we wait for this storm to pass
8466334 this is strange i never seen anything like this before
8466335 smurf a roo what other strange things are we going to find here
8466336 gee brainy if that didnt wake up the people that live here then i dont know what will
8466337 im not sure lets be careful though we still dont know what kind of people live here yet
8466338 hands on your head and get down on the ground
8466339 wait what lights are you talking about hefty and why are you telling me to hit them
8466340 well vouch for them they were asleep when the alarm went off
8466341 the smurflings are still safely all tucked in and sleeping soundly brainy
8466342 although it is obvious that we are not smurflings anymore
8466343 do not be rude to our guests that defiantly was not a smurfy thing to say
8466344 im tired and cranky if you want smurfy and nice talk to me again at three in the afternoon
8466345 forgive us we are not use to having visitors at this hour
8466346 if you must know smurfette i am brainette the crabby one beside me is toughette and over there the young smurfette is sorcerette we came from a village of smurfettes off the coast of ireland many many years ago
8466347 listen why dont we continue this discussion in a more ah comfortable setting
8466348 im certain you smurfs have more questions as do we and personally i need to sit down
8466349 you really know make a smurfy first good impression dont you
8466350 oh smurf up i dont know about you but i could use some coffee right about now
8466351 ill cut up some fruit and toast up a few bread slices for all of you
8466352 why dont you smurfs have a seat over here please make yourself at home
8466353 uh ill see if i can find more chairs be right back
8466354 oh this long chair is so comfortable that i coul
8466355 im sure you smurfs have more questions so why dont you ask one well answer the best we can then we can ask you any questions that we will have
8466356 amazing we have traveled over 500 years into the future
8466357 now i have a question how is it that you are able to be here in this time
8466358 what do you mean you dont know what time crystals are youre me arent you dont you remember going on adventures through time
8466359 oh trust me when i tell you handy you were a smurf ahead of his time you had invented stuff that humans just started created only a hundred years ago
8466360 here help yourselves to some fruit and toast more will come out shortly
8466361 i may be old papa smurf but i would remember if i saw something like that
8466362 is it possible that i may have a closer look at the crystal in your hand papa smurf
8466363 the angle and shape of this crystal is very profound its absosmurfly perfect
8466364 yes the crystals have been around practically since the dawn of time so to speak
8466365 perhaps later we can take these crystals to my lab and study them more closely that is if you are willing to do so
8466366 i can understand why the rest of you are well um older
8466367 but why is it that hefty over there hasnt aged much at all
8466368 dont let the age appearance fool you smurfs technically hefty is still the same age as me
8466369 i personally dont think being immortal is such a good idea
8466370 to live for an eternity i mean sure not ever aging sounds appealing but what about watching all your friends around you growing old and dying i dont think i could live with that
8466371 so if it isnt immortality you have hefty then what is it that makes you um unchanged in age
8466372 lets just say we were placed in hibernation crystals for five hundred years
8466373 about three years ago we were freed to rejoin smurfdom here in canada
8466374 five hundred years ago this country technically did not exist back then only native indians roamed the land the only other cultures that knew and invaded this land were ones called vikings nowadays many cultures from several countries live here in a somewhat peaceful environment
8466375 i still cant believe you are the papa smurf i mean ive herd stories that the elders told but this is you in the flesh
8466376 i dont believe weve been formally introduced young smurf where did you say where you were from
8466377 why not take a closer look at him papa smurf im sure youll recognize him
8466378 on our last trip we ended up home at the smurf village only everything was burnt to the ground
8466379 well do you smurfs know what know what happened to the village
8466380 we have different kinds from japan and oh we have some that just came in from india
8466381 secret squirrels isnt anyone going to tell us what happened to the village and why there was statue of hefty on the beach
8466382 it said that im supposed to be smurfed in two years from now or then or whenever
8466383 lets put it this way if i really had died do you think i would be sitting here right now talking to um myself
8466384 well lets just say there was an accident that leads ah you to the village of the smurfettes
8466385 if that hadnt happened the smurfs would never have met the smurfettes
8466386 and dont worry you do make it back home along with the smurfettes
8466387 so tell me does everyone call us papa smurf now
8466388 how about this place i must have played a big role in building it right
8466389 actually brainette here did most of the engineering towards the architecture of this place we call home
8466390 you must be incredibly busy with writing latest novels of quotations of brainy smurf
8466391 to be honest i dont write those books anymore havent done so in almost five hundred years
8466392 i put it in that glass casing to ensure that it is protected from aging
8466393 you should just admit you dont know instead of sitting there with your verbal diarrhea making assumptions on topics that are alien to you
8466394 look it stopped raining and isnt it time you young smurfs go for your morning workout
8466395 what do you guys say we have an early workout today since we are already awake
8466396 wait a second are all four of you going for a workout
8466397 weve been working out each morning for almost three years now
8466398 really what do you do besides going out for a jog
8466399 oh that depends on the day for example today we will go for a jog and after our martial arts training other colder rainier days we will go downstairs to the gym and do some aerobics lifts some weights and of course training with our martial arts
8466400 this world is more different then the world you know learning martial arts helps us to be prepared for anything besides who will protect this community if something attacks us them i dont think so their old
8466401 actually hon martial arts is a form of meditation and discipline
8466402 i suppose you want to join us with our morning work out
8466403 oh i think he can he is me after all
8466404 you smurfs be careful though our um sick friend is still running about out there
8466405 why dont you go down to the guests quarters and prepare some rooms for our time traveling visitors they must be tired from their journey and would like to rest for a bit before we introduce them to our smurflings during breakfast
8466406 come on smurfs well show you where youll be sleeping
8466407 i had a feeling you were holding that one in
8466408 much like how i had a feeling you had been holding back the agonizing pain in your back

8466459 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado
8466460 hechos como el de este domingo el atentado en vilc n claramente est n absolutamente fuera del marco de trabajo en el cual la conadi est funcionando
8466461 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
8466462 presente las debidas querellas criminales en contra del gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n por su participaci n en la apolog a a la violencia tales acciones criminales deben presentarse al m s breve plazo de lo contrario ser n las comunidades que concurrir n al tribunal
8466463 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial
8466464 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
8466465 esta situaci n se alan sucede porque carabineros act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
8466466 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
8466467 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche que result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta situaci n desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8466468 emplazamos al general de carabineros de la ix regi n a que informe objetivamente sobre el origen de los balines que afectan a su personal
8466469 muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche
8466470 quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia y amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las armas de fuego en contra de los comuneros mapuches
8466471 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos

8466474 en la octava y novena regi n son 1 500 comunidades mapuches
8466475 hay que mirarlo en su justa medida hay que darle la oportunidad a las polic as que trabajen tranquilas porque esta es una investigaci n de largo aliento no son investigaciones de un d a para otro para tener un resultado hay que tener paciencia
8466476 estamos tratando de obtener la mayor informaci n y yo he reforzado la cantidad de funcionarios para ver si podemos detener a las personas que corresponden de acuerdo a las instrucciones de los fiscales

8466485 this book is not intended to be a full or detailed history of animal morphology a complete account is given neither of morphological discoveries nor of morphological theories my aim has been rather to call attention to the existence of diverse typical attitudes to the problems of form and to trace the interplay of the theories that have arisen out of them the main currents of morphological thought are to my mind three the functional or synthetic the formal or transcendental and the materialistic or disintegrative
8466486 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas

8466488 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
8466489 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
8466490 en todo momento los carabineros preguntaban por armamento y el paradero de los pe i que est n requeridos por la justicia nuestros luchadores sociales mapuche se nos interroga por armas que jam s han encontrado ni jam s encontrar n porque no existen

8466627 heres the second truth killing an unborn child is never the right answer to a womans or societys problems acts of violence create a culture of violence and abortion is the most intimate form of violence there is it wounds the woman it kills the unborn child and it poisons the roots of justice and charity that bind us all into one human family
8466628 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right

8466670 the labor members of a senate committee have decided to rush out a report which endorses labor policy
8466671 the reality is that fuelwatch will not only not put the price of petrol down it will actually increase it
8466672 fuelwatch is nothing more than foolwatch and those labor mps that have decided to endorse it are doing nothing more than following mr rudd
8466673 its a rather unusual step that a senate committee would put out an interim report the purpose of which is to do nothing more than to deceive the independent senators
8466674 fuelwatch is sham it has the potential to push up the price of fuel for motorists its nothing more than a quick fix for kevin rudd the committee has failed to justify its position

8466911 viewing these portraits of soldiers causes one to pause and think of the many sacrifices and efforts these men and women have experienced to protect us and defend this great country the portraits are a stark reminder of the reality of it all
8466912 for me looking at their faces serves also as a reminder to remember our service men and women and to thank them for all they do and have done i am disappointed that the billboards have been canceled and strongly hope the company will reconsider

8466948 but it is the first match it is always the trickiest one but hopefully the next one will be better
8466949 hopefully i can play even better in the next round
8466950 after it happened i was thinking more of it than i was the pain so it is not really a big deal
8466951 but in a certain moment i felt big pain so i had to get it taped
8466952 it was really tough i am completely out of breath

8466961 and at first i was shocked to find myself inside of a silent mind but then i was immediately captivated by the magnificence of energy around me and because i could no longer identify the boundaries of my body i felt enormous and expansive i felt at one with all the energy that was and it was beautiful there

8466972 well either way the fbi sure does theyve been investigating and talking to me about that event ever since if there are any lawyers out there horny for some high profile copyright law battle drop us a line

8466974 i was really hoping that a few more guys would come along with us and we would have a better chance of staying away and setting up a bit of a gc general classification
8466975 but there was only four of us out there and unfortunately we lost two of them about halfway through so there was just me and the other aussie guy left out front he was really strong and we gave it a good shot
8466976 ive got a strong team here so im sure theyll help me defend it
8466977 glen was having serious sinus problems and had real difficulty breathing
8466978 maybe all the travel this month finally caught up to him
8466979 its a big disappointment especially since he would be very helpful trying to set matty up for the kom in the next couple of days but kobzarenko and moises aldape look good and i think they will all get stronger as the week goes on
8466980 re high functioning autism and kindergarten can you just try it out and change back to half days if whole days dont work out
8466981 re high functioning autism and kindergarten i didnt tell her to wait and see how things went i told her to wait and see what
8466982 re re high functioning autism and kindergarten i dont think anyone was attacking you they were just stating their own opinion
8466983 the clock is running make the most of today time waits for no man yesterday is history tomorrow is a mystery today is a gift thats why it is called the present
8466984 no tears in the writer no tears in the reader
8466985 no man really knows about other human beings the best he can do is to suppose that they are like himself
8466986 writing is about knowing yourself then its about helping others know you while at the same time identifying with universal traits
8466987 facts and truth really dont have much to do with each other
8466988 tavitas a lot better in year two in the system than he was in year one
8466989 i expect him to be even better a month from now four months from now and a year from now tavita has an excellent grasp of the offense
8466990 the number one thing you would have to say is the difference in lyle from this year to last year is confidence
8466991 that then relates right into speed of play and decision making understanding and the ability to take something that has happened and transform it into a positive
8466992 ever since we found out he was granted his redshirt year weve been doing great things
8466993 hes been able to help me help him out and the rest of the offense hes doing a great job of being one of the leaders out there and having him back in the offense is something special
8466994 with stanford they have a new defensive coordinator wed like to see them play before we play them we cant do that in some ways its a little bit of a mystery going in and its a conference opponent you put all that stuff together and it makes for a very interesting start
8466995 last year we had some big wins but were no way satisfied
8466996 those games only showed the potential we have were all confident that we can be one of the top teams in the pac 10 we can build on what it feels like to win big games beating cal was big to drive off of and look forward
8466997 looking around the room it was stunning you have over here the south carolina delegation the minnesota delegation african americans old and new tears as the votes came in

8467010 it has good profitability and is well capitalised with strong liquidity these factors put us in a sound position for the current and expected economic environment
8467011 this has been particularly evident in the household sector which is carrying the burden of higher interest rates and the impact of higher food fuel and other costs
8467012 the individual provision for credit impairment charge remains less than 0 2 percent of total loans but is expected to rise further in the period ahead

8467015 re re re re obama writes his speeches http rawstory com news 2008 deval patrick i asked obama to 0219 html the only words
8467016 pushed the painful truth about childbirth and modern maternity care
8467017 re re re re obama writes his speeches have you seen senator obama speaking live in person in a town hall meeting where the
8467018 most folks dont oppose toll roads which have been separate from our public highways
8467019 what krusees done in texas over the past few years is create a scheme that diverts our tax dollars intended for freeways into these double tax tollways
8467020 the public highway right of way has been shifted to tollways so theres this monopoly and people are sort of forced to pay this double tax
8467021 should person x murder and then eat person y in order to survive
8467022 if man were a mindless brute then would it be ethical for man to murder and eat the other life boater
8467023 if man were not man then would it be ethical for man to do x
8467024 well you know nature isnt knowable the facts of reality arent knowable or theyre chaotic and unpredictable or mans senses are unable to detect what reality is really like
8467025 do unto others as you would have them do unto you
8467026 well obviously the correct solution is for the lighter person to kill the heavier person and eat the heavier person for a greater number of days thereby increasing the likelihood that the lighter person will be found and rescued
8467027 no no there is right and wrong but it exists independently of what anyone thinks
8467028 theyre always good for everyone to eat regardless of their allergies regardless of what they like to eat etc
8467029 what are the facts of reality what is the nature of man
8467030 what is the standard by which we determine something to be good or to be evil
8467031 i think that in this scenario it is although unfortunate it would be ethical in order to kill and eat the other person the reason i think this is once again we are outside the context of normal human conduct
8467032 in the lifeboat ethics does not apply so go ahead be a cannibal
8467033 ethics does not apply in a life boat and therefore it is right to murder and eat another life boater
8467034 ethics do not apply in a life boat therefore it is right to kill and eat the other life boater
8467035 there are no ethics in a life boat therefore you should kill and eat the other guy in order to guarantee your survival or to prolong your survival
8467036 when you are in a life boat you need not be man you can resort to being an animal you can resort to being merely human but not man in a life boat a is no longer a man is no longer man
8467037 man is not the rational animal in a life boat we redefine man in a lifeboat to be the brute the mindless brute and then when he is rescued he pops back into being the rational animal
8467038 in a life boat ethics do not apply therefore murder and eat the other life boater
8467039 no hell just talk about what a wonderful guy biden is but when you think about it whos joe biden he ran 20 years ago for president he only got into the race this time because of a menopausal midlife crisis he was leaving the senate and he figured ill just do one more shot and run for president before i fade from the scene he was retiring
8467040 ill just do one more shot and run for president before i fade from the scene
8467041 we started a journey back then that will lead to a more perfect union
8467042 think about all the pain and hurt civil rights workers killed and still others did not give up they kept the faith now these people here are about to vote for an african american to be president of the united states of america
8467043 barack obama is ready to lead and restore our leadership in the world
8467044 these are the people who gave us life they are the reason we are here today
8467045 if there was any deep division in the music scene in 1977 it wasnt people scratching their heads at less than stellar releases from kansas foreigner styx or steely dan and neil young it was the demise of live music as disco came to prominence i could make the argument that kansas nugent and other arena acts gained fans because people who hated disco really hated disco myself included
8467046 john jansens comments made me think of some of the bad things white people have done timothy mcveigh terry nichols the unabomber not to mention almost all the serial killers in the u s and all those arab terrorists theyre caucasian i just dont think we can afford to have white people running this country they are way too dangerous
8467047 i really used to be amazed how these individuals could be so blatant about who they really are and yet have their assemblies still pour money into their pockets so they can live like movie stars and then you have those who are of the new faith cashians and followers of santa christ
8467048 obama says iran is a tiny country doesnt pose a serious threat terrorism
8467049 strong countries and strong presidents talk to their adversaries thats what kennedy did with khrushchev thats what reagan did with
8467050 its an incredibly liberating thing when you stop worrying about what other people think about you now i just need me to love me and as a result im a much better friend girlfriend sister aunt everything
8467051 the high capacities and performance of the sandisk extreme iii 30mb s edition sdhc cards give users the freedom to shoot lots of high resolution photos and video clips
8467052 the combination of our new sandisk extreme iii 30 mb s edition sdhc card technology and the nikon d90 camera maximizes performance
8467053 the facts are its not taking a vote away from them its taking the power away from the corporation and giving it to the working people
8467054 were getting out among our members and educating all of our members about exactly what it is
8467055 were trying to get them to talk to their neighbors to spread the word generally
8467056 we dont have 1 2 million to try and counteract those ads out there even though there will be some probably coming up
8467057 im very comfortable that by getting people at a national level to pay attention to this race when it tightens down in the end well be able to get some support nationwide that will really help us

8467066 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8467067 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8467068 news at 11 moment in there is that you seem surprised
8467069 it has good profitability and is well capitalised with strong liquidity these factors put us in a sound position for the current and expected economic environment
8467070 this has been particularly evident in the household sector which is carrying the burden of higher interest rates and the impact of higher food fuel and other costs
8467071 the individual provision for credit impairment charge remains less than 0 2 percent of total loans but is expected to rise further in the period ahead
8467072 we are disappointed that the methodist church leaders have not given the opportunity to the members to make up their own mind
8467073 this would have happened had they accepted the offer from the national council for building a better fiji to explain the charter
8467074 when it was shown to him he was very very pleased indeed
8467075 he could only widen his eyes or something like that but it was explained to him and he was thrilled
8467076 it probably did as much as the injections they were giving him
8467077 doctors dont usually make predictions but they are predicting that within three days they will be able to feed him solids and that should build up his strength
8467078 nuns are above all women and beauty is a gift from god
8467079 this contest will be a way to show there isnt just the beauty we see on television but also a more discreet charm
8467080 you really think all nuns are old stunted and sad this isnt the case anymore
8467081 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8467082 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8467083 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8467084 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8467085 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8467086 if these things are not to be undertaken im not just talking about electricity but other reforms certainly theres no role for me in the new south wales parliament
8467087 we will set about detailing an energy plan for the people of new south wales that they can decide on at the next election
8467088 theres absolutely nothing wrong with having accountability and thats what we have
8467089 the value of the house thats put on there is also taken into consideration
8467090 but when you remove the opportunity for a lender to take security over land then all theyve got is the building thats going to be put on there and thats not a strong case for a lender to consider when someones asking for a mortgage
8467091 were not aware of any lender that would lend on the basis of building a home on leasehold land which is really the premise of the proposal put forward
8467092 so the question is where would the lender feel comfortable when theres really no security
8467093 running around telling staff this is a damn mess and were all failing is not the way you bring about change in a school
8467094 youve actually got to motivate people and one of things ive found is that youve got to tell students in that particular school we are a good school you are great students look at the good things you are doing
8467095 you dont walk around saying god were all terrible it doesnt motivate anybody
8467096 what people need to understand is that in south australia we already have a professional pay scheme which is called the elevated skills teachers program
8467097 its been highly successful in making sure that we keep experienced teachers in the classroom
8467098 we are concerned about the attraction retention provisions that are in place and were working with the state government to seek improvements via our enterprise bargaining negotiations
8467099 most alarmingly it seems to be affecting young childrens breathing and several children have been hospitalised usually overnight over the last week as a precaution
8467100 we did have a staff member admitted to hospital for a couple of nights as well but shes home now
8467101 today we have 271 students absent and 20 staff including 11 classroom teachers
8467102 could and should have been taken into account in sentencing
8467103 its been such a joy to take this show to so many countries that ive never been to before but its a real thrill to finally be bringing it home to australia and to be able to share it with you all
8467104 the regulator requires a minimum standard of english competency but this is part of the wide ranging aspects of information gathering that well be looking at
8467105 there is an accent problem but that accent problem is no different from an airline captain from air india or air china or singapore airlines coming into melbourne its no different
8467106 we were obviously really really shaken just to think how lucky we are as a family
8467107 we were outside ten minutes before it happened and i mean i am sure if the other plane that clipped and hit i dont think we if we were outside i dont think we would be here today
8467108 look im not aware that the trainee pilots do fly over this school but obviously it happened yesterday

8467120 the background of this is about how black men had been treated when they tried to pursuit their freedom in the eighteen century but when i heard this it reminded me what i had been through within these years it quite inspires me and then i start to think about my keep going
8467121 sure we could be farther behind but we could be ahead
8467122 it doesnt feel good to go out there and lose
8467123 especially when we know were better and were capable of doing a lot of good things
8467124 ive been bitten by the home run in the second half
8467125 i dont know what it is a lot of them have been the solo variety it gives our team a chance to stay in the game
8467126 you play this game long enough and you know teams are going to hit skids like this its just part of the game but its still frustrating to go through it
8467127 we have to worry about whats going on here if we take care of our business the standings will come out if we keep winning were not worried about the diamondbacks just like theyre probably not worried about us
8467128 because hes supposed to be in the lineup roberts played and he killed us i think im going to blame cintron for that one
8467129 it hasnt been the kind of homestand that we drew up on a blueprint
8467130 we played all very good teams that are all in contention i think it just goes back to a real simple formula if you dont pitch good you dont have a chance
8467131 liz did enough to stay out of the big inning
8467132 he pitched around some walks i thought this time his changeup was real key for him because they were sitting on the fastball
8467133 theres just no other way of putting it i was just flat out awful
8467134 i couldnt even give us a chance to win i hope i can put this behind me pretty soon it will be a long night
8467135 john he not throw the ball the way weve see him throw the ball
8467136 for matt and myself itd be nice knowing what the situation would be and be able to move forward with it the way i look at it more than anything the sooner it can happen the sooner we can get past the interviews and media coverage that goes with it and you can prepare for the game
8467137 we know its getting close and you get that anxiety and excitement knowing the decision has to be made soon i am sure coach understands that and hell make the decision as soon as its necessary
8467138 hopefully well get in enough snaps with the first offensive line that both can play
8467139 i just wanted to make sure kurt gets his timing with the ones for this game much like we did in kansas city
8467140 patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish
8467141 now something so sad has hold of us that the breath leaves and we cant even cry
8467142 winstons a lying slimey bastard but hes got me by the fallopian tubes
8467143 i think we all had fun once we knew it was all safe
8467144 thats bad i dont want my kids around that bro thats a first
8467145 the homeless have totally been fucked by all of this
8467146 its really sad that our city has been invaded i guess its good that the city gets all these tax breaks but its not good for the residents
8467147 of course were going to discuss it that doesnt mean were going to force people to recognise
8467148 we reassert our strong and continued support for georgias sovereignty within its internationally recognized borders and underline our respect and support for the democratic and legitimate government of georgia as we pursue a peaceful durable solution to this conflict
8467149 underlined the urgent neccessity to lower tension and to fully apply the six points of the ceasefire agreement
8467150 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aide using battleships
8467151 any attempts to jeopardise this atmosphere of cooperation would not only have a negative impact for russia but will definitely harm the

8467157 construction will continue to suffer but if fuel prices continue to improve could we see as sudden an upswing in retail as the downswing we saw over the first half of 2008
8467158 secondly we have the employment figures now i would expect most of the loosening to be occurring in wholesale and retail trade as well as construction
8467159 mark priestley was a tremendous young person loved and respected by his fellow all saints cast members and crew

8467163 whether youre famous or not what it just means is that the rest of us will hear about it it doesnt mean that theyre the only people who will experience it theyre all equally tragic
8467164 but it can be harder for famous people to seek help because of their high profiles
8467165 my thoughts and prays are with marks family and friends he will be sorely missed my many

8467180 were going to keep our commitments to afghanistan and iraq as we have pledged to do
8467181 were gathering better intelligence because now the iraqis are less afraid to pass along tips about where enemy fighters are hiding and where they keep their weapons
8467182 is substantially degraded running out of sanctuaries losing the fight
8467183 has given iraqs elected leaders the breathing room to pass new reforms and theyve stepped up to their responsibilities
8467184 are able to lead more and more operations on their own
8467185 weve brought home all five of the combat brigades and the three marine units who were sent into iraq as part of the surge
8467186 further troop movements will as always depend on what is happening on the ground
8467187 ive had no greater privilege than the chance to work with members of the american armed forces
8467188 i believe that if anyone lacks for inspiration in the war on terror they need look no farther than the men and women who do the fighting
8467189 whether its on cold mountain peaks in afghanistan or the hot dusty streets of iraq they have been magnificent
8467190 and a new generation of warriors is the next chapter of american ingenuity bravery and valor

8467251 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8467252 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed

8467264 the coalition will oppose the rudd labor governments punitive 30 per cent increase in the so called luxury car tax
8467265 it is the politics of envy which will increase inflation
8467266 the highest selling so called luxury car is the toyota landcruiser which retails for around 70 000 and are driven primarily by those in rural and regional australia and those with the need for a people mover
8467267 the opposition has decided to stand up for lower taxes on luxury cars rather than for lower interest rates for working families
8467268 the labor members of a senate committee have decided to rush out a report which endorses labor policy
8467269 the reality is that fuelwatch will not only not put the price of petrol down it will actually increase it
8467270 fuelwatch is nothing more than foolwatch and those labor mps that have decided to endorse it are doing nothing more than following mr rudd
8467271 its a rather unusual step that a senate committee would put out an interim report the purpose of which is to do nothing more than to deceive the independent senators
8467272 fuelwatch is sham it has the potential to push up the price of fuel for motorists its nothing more than a quick fix for kevin rudd the committee has failed to justify its position
8467273 the analysis by the accc has been criticised the committee travelled the width and breadth of the country and struggled to find anyone who would support this hare brained scheme
8467274 certainly the accs work is certainly subject to some considerable question
8467275 fuelwatch is working against independent petrol retailers in western australia in fact many have closed down since the introduction
8467276 there were 200 independent petrol retailers before fuelwatch there are now 17

8467278 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8467279 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8467280 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8467281 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8467282 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8467283 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8467284 slow strengthening is forecast once gustav moves farther away from haiti and the storm could regain hurricane strength within the next day or two

8467292 theyre doing this to use less oil and sell it for a 120 a barrel we can switch our cars to natural gas and stop sending our dollars to foreign countries
8467293 had it not been for that citizen calling who knows what would have happened
8467294 the only comment we can make is were gathering all the facts and well be representing him in the case

8467303 its really hard to keep them in stock as soon as we get stuff in stock we sell it right away
8467304 i want you to know i dont feel any anger at all were gonna be ok i dont think you need to be made an example

8467314 its not a great result at home when you should have done better
8467315 we gave away the ball way too much in the second half
8467316 a bit of lack of concentration could have cost us the game but we won and if we play well defensively down there theres no reason we shouldnt win
8467317 we had chances in the second half and didnt score
8467318 but we didnt show all we have i think well do better in the home leg
8467319 but a win is a win the 1 0 is better than it seems because it forces them to win a game and if we can score an away goal it could be a huge advantage for us

8467338 were prepared to have an argument if thats necessary you cant simply allow our kids to be in schools which are consistently underperforming
8467339 whats not smart is having underperforming schools year after year decade after decade not even measuring it not even recognising its happening and not even doing anything about it
8467340 what you should measure is if youve got like student populations and you can see one school thats rocketing up the attainment level and the other school thats falling behind then you can go into this school and say whats happening here what are the teachers doing whats the principal doing what are the parents doing thats making a difference
8467341 you can take that best practice to the school thats falling behind
8467342 the real challenge for mr rudd is will he now withhold funding from those state government and non government schools that do not comply
8467343 in our view its the richness of diversity like a colorful tapestry that makes the world and our neighborhood such a wonderful place

8467387 the prosecution case has many weaknesses not least of which is the evidence of dr hussain himself but it is not so devoid of evidence that there is no case
8467388 being given a list of questions in advance provided him an opportunity to ensure that his evidence was consistent something no doubt a jury would take into account when assessing his evidence

8467439 i came to work this morning which is option expiry day saying wed be up 40 points and were up 46 at the moment so im happy with that he said
8467440 i think we saw bhp and rio both up in the uk and new york so we had a little bit on our side when we made that forecast and option expiry usually steadies the market anyway
8467441 we need wins to move up the table and to give us confidence
8467442 were absolutely convinced that we have the right man for the job and that were heading in the right direction we have absolute patience
8467443 im not worked up all im completely calm we drew ten times last year and we ended up champions by ten points
8467444 i am happy because we have played two games and won two games but it is difficult
8467445 we now have a big derby on sunday and all the teams are very good
8467446 hopefully weve got all the injuries at the start of the season and we can get everyone back fit more or less after the international break
8467447 in a way its fallen nicely for us having only two league games in the first four or five weeks of the season when weve got a few injuries
8467448 kami sekarang kami datang ke misano dengan semangat yang tinggi hanya belum mengetahui apa kami juga dapat masalah dengan ban seperti dialami di dua balapan sebelum ini
8467449 together we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar

8467451 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
8467452 novell bought the unix system to lead the industry in unifying it while increasing its openness and strengthening its value to customers through volume distribution
8467453 our business objective is to extend the value of the unix system to the tens of millions of industry standard computers shipped with intel processors

8467457 all i know is joe cari is a friend and hes an honorable guy but i dont know anything beyond that
8467458 i simply dont think that the people of florida are gonna say the nominee of our party ought to be a person who on more than one occasion has expressed lack of understanding of our economy at a time when the economy is the number one issue that people are talking about
8467459 im deeply disappointed the republican party seems poised to select a nominee who did not support a constitutional amendment to protect the institution of marriage who has little regard for freedom of speech and has a legendary temper and often uses foul and obscene language
8467460 john mccain on foreign policy even worse than bush the foreign policy that john mccain now advocates is reckless and promiscuously interventionist if he were a university student majoring in international relations or security studies he would deserve a resounding f for his analysis of the crucial issues that the united states has confronted over the past 14 or 15 years
8467461 the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
8467462 his temper would place this country at risk in international affairs and the world perhaps in danger in my mind it should disqualify him
8467463 an occupation of undetermined length undetermined cost and undetermined consequences
8467464 its one of the many aspects we will be looking at communication covers a wide range of issues such as if there was miscommunication misunderstanding and other issues
8467465 were at a very early stage we have no specific direction we are looking slowly carefully and thoroughly seeking to make sure we know what went on before we analyse or form a conclusion
8467466 its not enough that he wants to be president he wants to be zeus
8467467 slow strengthening is forecast once gustav moves farther away from haiti and the storm could regain hurricane strength within the next day or two
8467468 regardless of its predicted path it is important for citizens in the gulf coast region to listen to what their local officials are advising over the course of the next few days and to take these simple steps to prepare
8467469 as long as there is a chance that well be in this storm ill be here in louisiana
8467470 evacuating personnel not essential to producing and drilling operations in the gulf
8467471 most models now show it is on a collision course for the gulf of mexicos productive regions with memories of hurricane katrina still fresh in most participants minds it is understandable that prices have broken sharply higher
8467472 it has good profitability and is well capitalised with strong liquidity these factors put us in a sound position for the current and expected economic environment
8467473 this has been particularly evident in the household sector which is carrying the burden of higher interest rates and the impact of higher food fuel and other costs
8467474 the individual provision for credit impairment charge remains less than 0 2 percent of total loans but is expected to rise further in the period ahead
8467475 recent comprehensive and systematic reviews of the evidence show that food advertising affects what children eat what they prefer to eat and what they pester their parents for
8467476 the federal government needs to put in place legislation that protects children supports parents and does not undermine campaigns to promote healthy lifestyles
8467477 it is a shame that the revised standards have put broadcasters revenue before our childrens health
8467478 a national ban on junk food advertising during childrens tv viewing hours is a sensible first step in tackling childhood obesity
8467479 an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
8467480 senator browns amendment if successful would potentially compromise acmas standing as an independent regulatory body

8467486 theyll probably never learn that at a press conference in may just minutes before a vote on a massive farm bill collins praised a provision in the measure to close the so called enron loophole she then headed straight to the senate floor and voted against the bill we regional reporters put readers in rooms like that and give them a voice but were disappearing fast and its not clear who can pick up the slack
8467487 daily newspapers covered the statehouse like a blanket when i moved back here was amazed at how bad the coverage was

8467503 it gave voice to americas ideals in a way that has been done very rarely in any speech in american history
8467504 i was 2 years old at the time and i think its fair to say that had it not been for not just the speech but the movement behind the speech the sentiments behind the speech the work and the toil and the risks that were taken by previous generations then i wouldnt be in denver on thursday accepting the nomination for the presidency
8467505 hes going to set the stakes of this election the risks of continuing down the road were on which is plainly what sen mccain is offering and hes going to talk about an alternative path thats rooted in the best of what this country is and the kind of future that we can build if we take it
8467506 weve been told that most of hillarys supporters have united behind mccain that is absolute crap
8467507 our foremothers marched in the streets so that our voices could be heard we will not be silenced now

8467513 el equipo que llevamos tambi n es muy potente no vienen los titulares del tour pero los que acuden llegan con las ideas claras y tienen ilusi n por correr con haedo tendremos opciones al esprint kolobnev puede desempe ar un papel importante y luego un grupo de corredores con experiencia que se defienden bien en todos los terrenos con i igo cuesta gustov blauzdun est n todos motivados para ayudarme

8467515 it is not going to be for investment or money from the commonwealth
8467516 it is going to be for people to help us realise the opportunities we have
8467517 we have some very old under invested public transport in this state
8467518 we now have to re invest in the public transport system we will be rolling out 2 billion in investment in this sector over the next decade
8467519 our tram extension has already been a huge success now we will be expanding that service and we will make public transport far more attractive
8467520 it will allow high quality high density growth within the urban growth boundary to accommodate a growing population
8467521 public transport goes hand in glove with a good road system
8467522 clearly the job of the next president is to rebuild the american dream and restore americas standing in the world
8467523 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8467524 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8467525 vamos a adoptar una postura discreta dados los apretados presupuestos que manejamos
8467526 pese a los malos tiempos que corren para el sector nuestros miembros siguen donando dinero
8467527 im looking for 1 5 percent growth for the third quarter
8467528 we are still in the global economic race to the bottom which the dollar has won
8467529 this is a step in the right direction in the sense that anything that actually helps management gain credibility with investors who have been time and and again hurt by these companies is a step in the right direction is it too late i think ultimately it probably will prove too late the damage is done
8467530 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president

8467537 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8467538 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8467539 and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8467540 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8467541 barack obama est pronto para liderar os eua barack obama est pronto para jurar respeitar e defender a constitui o dos eua barak obama est pronto para ser presidente dos eua
8467542 em 1992 os republicanos disseram que eu era muito novo e inexperiente parece familiar mas isso n o funcionou em 1992 porque est vamos do lado certo da hist ria e n o vai funcionar este ano porque barack obama est do lado certo da hist ria
8467543 minha candidata hillary n o ganhou mas estou orgulhoso da campanha que ela fez ela falou ontem que far tudo o que puder para eleger obama ent o somos dois

8467557 father my vanity gets me in trouble so many times its almost as if that vanity and pride are etched in me and you are the only one who can either mold it away or fill it with something else please continue to do a good work in me i get so far and then i fall so many steps back it is frustrating and so annoying thank you for not giving up on me and atleast teaching me to laugh at myself in your precious name amen

8467559 barack obama is ready to honour the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution barack obama is ready to be president of the united states he said going further even than the former first lady in her speech yesterday
8467560 president clinton is obviously committed to doing whatever he can and is asked to do to ensure senator obama is the next president of the united states
8467561 together we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief the former arkansas governor said
8467562 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history he said bringing thousands of delegates to their feet
8467563 yall sit down we got to get along with the show here sit down please stop please sit he implored the audience as the welcome ovation stretched into five minutes

8467570 i had to be consistent and try to get a high percentage of my first serves in
8467571 i didnt return so well and i had a lot of ups and downs and big frustrations
8467572 but it is the first match it is always the trickiest one but hopefully the next one will be better
8467573 hopefully i can play even better in the next round
8467574 after it happened i was thinking more of it than i was the pain so it is not really a big deal
8467575 but in a certain moment i felt big pain so i had to get it taped
8467576 it was really tough i am completely out of breath
8467577 i was concerned i was going to get my dress dirty
8467578 the most important thing is to stay positive in the difficult moments in the match even when you feel tired
8467579 when i got into a dangerous situation so i started moving her around a little bit more in the second set i was able to gain more confidence
8467580 the prosecution case has many weaknesses not least of which is the evidence of dr hussain himself but it is not so devoid of evidence that there is no case
8467581 being given a list of questions in advance provided him an opportunity to ensure that his evidence was consistent something no doubt a jury would take into account when assessing his evidence
8467582 i always said that the more that axl and geffen jerked around trying to figure out how to release this finally finished album that weve all been waiting over 13 years for the greater the chances would be that it would slip out of a pressing plant or office somewhere and wind up in the hands of some asshole with a blog
8467583 so remember when we let you guys listen to some allegedly ha new guns n roses songs we got our hands on

8467597 if anything the fact that officials recognized the concern about the dollars decline seems somewhat supportive for the dollar as maybe benign neglect was not so neglectful
8467598 at the end of the day however president bush is still set to be the first american president since at least the break up of bretton woods that has not authorized intervention in the fx market and given the recent price action the distinction looks relatively safe

8467634 promote cooperation and understanding between reserve component members and their civilian employers and to assist in the resolution of conflicts arising from an employees military commitment
8467635 i was asked to assist a friend of mine whose son recently returned from iraq and was having problems getting his job and benefits back we contacted esgr and they were very helpful the situation was resolved in less than two weeks and while we were involved with esgr and that issue they asked us both to be volunteers we thought this was a worthwhile organization so we both joined about three years ago
8467636 to know that support is there is very beneficial for us
8467637 we know who to contact now in the event that we have any questions and vice versa if they ever need to contact us
8467638 i like the fact that i know were performing a much needed task
8467639 i know the work we do is appreciated by both the employer and the employee i get a great sense of satisfaction out of helping
8467640 i ran on a platform of change of course thats what america was ready for
8467641 the difference between me and obama is that i didnt have any money
8467642 he can say when i am president of the united states we will never torture another prisoner while i am president of the united states we will never go to war against another country unless our own security is directly threatened when i am president of the united states we will be the champion of human rights all over the earth
8467643 im not defending russia but we still need to be sensitive to how they feel as they are surrounded by increasingly friendly nations to the west
8467644 the time for change has come and barack obama is the change we need
8467645 he offers specific ideas to help our struggling middle class families meet the challenges they face each and every day
8467646 george bush took the largest surplus in our nations history and turned it into the largest deficit borrowing billions from china japan even mexico john mccain would continue this dangerous fiscal irresponsibility and that is not the change we need
8467647 i want everybody to now understand why i am so proud to have joe biden and the whole biden family
8467648 i think hes presented himself pretty well so far what do you think
8467649 no longer will the eight most dreaded words in the be the vice presidents office is on the phone
8467650 i know it you know it barack obama gets it
8467651 this is the time as americans together we get back up
8467652 these are extraordinary times this is an extraordinary election are ready barack obama is ready this is his time this is our time this is americas time
8467653 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8467654 ive been on the ground in georgia iraq and i can tell you in no uncertain terms this administrations policy has been an abject failure
8467655 again and again on the most important of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8467656 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8467657 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8467658 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8467659 be there because will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8467660 joe biden is right we need more than a good soldier we need a leader with the experience and judgment to serve as commander in chief from day one that leader is
8467661 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8467662 if you drilled everywhere if you drilled in all of john mccains backyards even the ones he doesnt know he has that single proposition is a dry well

8467675 so close the infinitesimal and the infinite but suddenly i knew they were really the two ends of the same concept the unbelievably small and the unbelievably vast eventually meet like the closing of a gigantic circle i looked up as if somehow i would grasp the heavens the universe worlds beyond number gods silver tapestry spread across the night and in that moment i knew the answer to the riddle of the infinite i had thought in terms of mans own limited dimension i had presumed upon nature that existence begins and ends in mans conception not natures and i felt my body dwindling melting becoming nothing my fears melted away and in their place came acceptance all this vast majesty of creation it had to mean something and then i meant something too yes smaller than the smallest i meant something too to god there is no zero i still exist
8467676 its like jennifer is on nothing less than a revenge tour while in the past jennifer shunned publicity and shrank from photographers lenses now shes openly encouraging the attention smiling showing off her body and creating photo ops
8467677 since john said it was he who broke off their four month romance jennifer has kept a stiff upper lip and let her actions do the talking making sure everyone sees her smiling and looking sexy
8467678 jennifer was glowing smiling and being very friendly as she ate tuna tartare rock shrimp and spinach salad with a glass of wine it was hard to believe this was a woman who just broke up with her boyfriend
8467679 what most people dont seem to realize is that there is just as much money to be made out of the wreckage of a civilization as from the upbuilding of one
8467680 as near an approach to the wholly evil will as is possible he had gone the way of all tyrants beginning well at least on the level that while desiring to order all things according to his own wisdom he still at first considered the economic well being of other inhabitants of the earth but he went further than human tyrants in pride and lust for domination being in origin an immortal angelic spirit sauron desired to be a god king and was held to be this by his servants if he had been victorious he would have demanded divine honour from all rational creatures and absolute temporal power over the whole world
8467681 for into the midst of all these policies comes the ring of power the foundation of barad dur and the hope of sauron concerning this thing my lords you now all know enough for the understanding of our plight and of saurons if he regains it your valour is vain and his victory will be swift or complete so complete that none can foresee the end of it while this world lasts if it is destroyed then he will fall and his fall will be so low that none can foresee his arising ever again for he will lose the best part of his strength that was native to him in his beginning and all that was made or begun with that power will crumble and he will be maimed for ever becoming a mere spirit of malice that gnaws itself in the shadows but cannot again grow or take shape and so a great evil of this world will be removed other evils there are that may come for sauron is himself but a servant or emissary

8467688 with market conditions likely to remain volatile for the rest of this year delivering growth in the short term will continue to be challenging but we remain confident in the medium to long term outlook for the wealth management industry chief executive craig dunn who started in the position on january 1 said
8467689 while amp will prudently manage through these market conditions we will also continue to invest where we see potential growth opportunities that position us well over the medium to long term mr dunn said
8467690 m amp a can be legitimate but it would have to be strategically relevant he told journalists
8467691 we expect margins to contract by two to three per cent per annum over the longer term because of the competitive market in which we operate he said
8467692 our capital strategy is aimed at enhancing this already strong position in the current climate increasing business flexibility to grow and further optimising our capital mix mr dunn said
8467693 id rather you shot at tin cans in the back yard but i know youll go after birds shoot all the bluejays you want if you can hit em but remember its a sin to kill a mockingbird
8467694 mockingbirds dont do one thing but make music for us to enjoy they dont eat up peoples gardens dont nest in corncribs they dont do one thing but sing their hearts out for us thats why its a sin to kill a mockingbird

8467703 although i saw both adrian greniers and kevin connollys trailer i only saw adrian at the set on 57th street at the directors guild building also martin scorsese was directing a part from it he walked right past me no one even noticed him i was surprised after filming was over around 2 30 adrian came out and was so nice taking pictures with everyone and so handsome i really enjoyed the day thanks for the tips
8467704 they were shooting 3 blocks from my house the whole cast and crew were nice to the people adrian took several pics with fans and even wanted me to take a pic of him with the cops kevin connolly nicely introduced himself to a mother who asked him to take a pic with her son he let the son sit in his chair they shot a backyard party scene where vinny comes back home it was just with adrian kevin and an actress

8467713 samantha is certainly telling friends shes planning to write a book its supposed to be about her allegedly but come on you know lindsay will be all over that book shes the only one people want to read about
8467714 ive shut up about this long enough samantha is using my daughter people never even knew who samantha ronson was until she met lindsay she was just some los angeles dj and now shes writing a book i am at my wits end with this stuff this is not in lindsays best interest
8467715 lets just say i hope lindsay starts opening her eyes and realizes who the people using her are
8467716 samantha drinks and passes the drinks under the table to lindsay and behind the scenes it gets worse and worse sam is using my daughter my daughter isnt working because shes always with sam even my ex wife dina knows it she just isnt doing anything about it
8467717 our primary findings suggested that smoking physical inactivity and obesity are inversely linked to awareness of the psa test these risk behaviors are linked with higher prostate cancer morbidity and mortality
8467718 the results concur with our initial hypothesis that men who adopt unhealthy lifestyles may be less concerned with health and less aware of preventive measures like the psa test
8467719 the uk is the first place we were warned about under dress shots weve been scared ever since
8467720 it bothers me because i didnt get into the industry for that but you just have to plan stuff out
8467721 its not the attention that i personally want to get but sometimes you just have to realise that its a part of what you do and embrace it and make sure youre poised to represent yourself the best way you can

8467723 the mean brain volume in preterm infants with abnormal blood flow distribution was 45 millilitres smaller than in other preterm infants
8467724 we examined tissue samples from preterm placentas and classified them as per the amount of inflammation found in microscopic examinations inflammatory reactions were seen in 45 per cent of the placentas
8467725 a genotype causing strong inflammatory response increases the risk of placental inflammation but conversely protects the child against inflammation our preliminary findings suggest that genetic regulation of interleukin 6 is also linked to the volume of the deep gray matter of the brain
8467726 in order for us to create therapys that can help protect the development of the brain its essential that we systematically follow up the development of preterm infants this should always be an integral part of the care of preterm infants
8467727 these new findings have several clinical implications besides the impairment of sexual function in these young men
8467728 the lack of testosterone during these critical years may lead to diminished bone mass and the lack of development or lose of skeletal muscle in addition these patients may gain more weight with an average body mass index of 38 they already were obese and become more insulin resistant
8467729 also patients with low testosterone and type 2 diabetes have been shown to have very high concentrations of c reactive protein
8467730 which increases their risk of developing atherosclerosis and heart disease above and beyond the risk linked to diabetes
8467731 while obesity contributes to the association of type 2 diabetes and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism hh the association is not dependent entirely on obesity
8467732 in our first study of diabetic men we observed that 31 percent of lean type 2 diabetics also had hh so it is likely that factors other than obesity contribute to hh possibly insulin resistance
8467733 whether obesity or insulin resistance is the major determinant of hh has to be addressed in future studies and the pathogenesis of hh needs to be defined
8467734 i am floored by how many times during the design of an employee incentive plan management trots out the assumption as though it were an indisputable truth that individual employees are unable to make a meaningful contribution to overall organization or business unit performance measures
8467735 well these people cant make a difference in the organizations bottom line
8467736 employees are human but at the end of the day theyre just a resource
8467737 part of the problem may be of our own creation
8467738 the topic of engaging and retaining talent seems to be even hotter by now you have purchased and read the best selling book by my colleague and friend beverly kaye love em or lose em and know all the strategies for keeping your best talent however a recent study by clearrock an executive coaching firm located in boston found that holding onto high performing talent is challenging whether you love em or not

8467745 eligible health fund members can expect to receive between several hundred and several thousand dollars mua chief executive john brogden said
8467746 members will also gain access to the wider range of services offered by hcf including optical and dental clinics
8467747 mua offers hcf additional scale and a younger membership which will help hcf keep premiums
8467748 if the merger is approved hcf will be financially stronger more efficient and flexible and even better placed to grow at a faster than industry rate

8467760 jennie why on earth did you ask for this book
8467761 gerrard will have an operation tomorrow on a groin problem we knew this would happen he had a problem and now he will have an operation and he will be out for 10 or 15 days its not a big problem but he had pain and it was difficult
8467762 the injury wasnt affected by the period of extra time
8467763 he was playing with pain before and he kept going today because he knew he was going to see the surgeon tomorrow its not serious its a minor operation but we needed to do it
8467764 we knew it would be difficult because they played well in the first game and we had to work really hard until the end for me the most positive thing is we played a little bit better against a good team who are sharp now we scored right at the end that showed the team was working really hard
8467765 when you play these kind of games the other team is playing and training just thinking about this game
8467766 we wanted to play in the champions league we have been in the semi final and final the last two years it was a tough match but we believed in ourselves and it was a good performance
8467767 they were tough they were really fighting even in extra time
8467768 it was a big game for us and the response was clear
8467769 there was togetherness and focus that is what we wanted after a result like saturday
8467770 we needed to be organised because they play a little with your patience
8467771 blogging is not a magic bean for a magic beanstalk
8467772 we look to see if they are checking vehicles properly for bombs to see if they are linked to drug smugglers or demanding bribes from farmers bringing supplies into the city
8467773 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
8467774 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
8467775 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
8467776 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
8467777 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
8467778 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

8467781 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract

8467784 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
8467785 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
8467786 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
8467787 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
8467788 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
8467789 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
8467790 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
8467791 he is still young enough he is going to have a lot of good years ahead of him he just has to quit pressing
8467792 when he has a night like that he is going to hear it from the crowd

8467813 there is a russia narrative that we were weak in the 90s but now we are back and we are not going to take it more but being angry and seeking revanchist victory is not the sign of a strong nation it is the sign of a weak one
8467814 russia is going to have to come to terms with the reality it can either integrate with the world or it can be a self isolated bully but it cant be both and thats a choice russia has to have
8467815 they are kind of giddy they will need to sober up
8467816 when they sober up they will see that it is not the u s that has done things to them its that they have done things to themselves
8467817 today russia is more isolated less trusted and less respected than two weeks ago it has made military gains in the short term but over time it will feel economic and political losses
8467818 no one asked what impact its actions had on the russian stock market there was no russian stock market
8467819 russias decision has called into question its commitment to peace and security in the caucasus
8467820 the georgian people won their freedom after years of tyranny and they can count on the friendship of the united states
8467821 three american presidents bush clinton and bush have all in their own way sought to encourage russias integration with the wider world this is a good thing it was the right set of policies
8467822 russia has now put all of that at risk because russian can not simultaneously behave like the soviet union toward its neighbors like this is 1968 and act as if it is 2008 when it comes to the wto
8467823 there are areas where we have common interest with russia and we want to work with them the question is whether russia has an ability to work with us
8467824 georgia is a flawed democracy a democracy in construction you dont help them by whitewashing their problems or defending a bad decision but you dont want it crushed

8467828 the prosecution case has many weaknesses not least of which is the evidence of dr hussain himself but it is not so devoid of evidence that there is no case
8467829 being given a list of questions in advance provided him an opportunity to ensure that his evidence was consistent something no doubt a jury would take into account when assessing his evidence

8467835 i actually care about the site to say the hard things that no one wants to hear
8467836 if this site is so lively why was my last article that hit the front page and pretty much the last one i submitted was around 50 days ago and im still in the top 10 in the leader board
8467837 irc is just another distraction from the fucked state of the main site
8467838 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
8467839 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
8467840 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
8467841 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin

8467850 hopefully i can play even better in the next round
8467851 every time you have people in the area it means somebodys going to spend a little money either for tire repair or fuel or meals things like that and it helps
8467852 we deliver information with regards to the state of infrastructure and what it costs to repair infrastructure we want people to be fully aware of what we need to do to make sure we get that done in an efficient manner
8467853 the states around us dont have quite the same situation that we do so theres a lot of demand national for how to fund infrastructure and thats going to impact the state of north dakota so we just want people to be aware of whats in front of us in 2009 and 2010
8467854 theres a lot of demand for money right now and there is a concern for the state of some of the infrastructure in our state and we want to make sure were spending our money wisely and theres enough of it thats our number one concern

8467856 it was very important for me that i play very well here to come back as a top 10 player and play very good
8467857 i played good for a first round because i can be nervous and my confidence is not so great at the beginning of a tournament i played well all three sets fighting well with very good concentration
8467858 i didnt want to really play tennis i didnt want to prepare for tournaments thats why i didnt play very good in toronto and cincinnati
8467859 thats is why i have tried to come back i have few tournaments to end this year and it was very important for me to play good here this is the last grand slam tournament this year
8467860 but i still play i dont want to quit tennis i try to play better and better and maybe i find my game maybe i find my confidence mentally and can play very well
8467861 i didnt hear anything now i dont know whats happening i dont hear anything really long time
8467862 our schedule is every bit as challenging as any weve played since ive been at clemson
8467863 he is still young enough he is going to have a lot of good years ahead of him he just has to quit pressing

8467869 within the worlds emerging economies millions of new businesses are demanding just the technology they need at the prices they can afford from a vendor they can trust
8467870 we have high hopes for broad adoption in the 20 countries
8467871 a good move because its not only in emerging markets where there are high growth rates but also among small and medium businesses
8467872 given dells history this represents a tactical move to build out its channels and reach out to more customers
8467873 the key thing that we did is we focused on the functionality that was required and then we didnt add features that werent going to be used
8467874 a really good way to describe this is that small and medium enterprises in emerging countries have basic needs internet access office productivity tools basic accounting those kinds of things and they have a limited budget
8467875 its just a matter of whether they can reach consumers
8467876 its very conceivable that two thirds of revenue for dell will come from outside of the united states five years from now

8467888 obama and ayers both attended some 1995 board meetings of the chicago annenberg challenge which ayers was instrumental in starting and obama chaired in the 1990s ayers was part of the groups operational arm the chicago school reform collaborative which reviewed proposals for challenge grants and made recommendations to the board according to the organizations early documents during a june 1995 meeting ayers was credited with having worked diligently to support the board and the collaborative according to meeting minutes but more than a year later obama pushed the group to be bolder in its reforms minutes from an october 1996 gathering show obama a guest at a meeting of the collaborative raised questions about what the group should be doing the minutes characterized obamas concerns as twofold whether the group was raising additional money and whether money was being used to prop up existing organizations as opposed to creating fresh educational practices in the schools at the end of five years will we have broken the mold not much seems to be bubbling up that is inspiring or substantive the minutes say paraphrasing obama
8467889 chicago annenberg challenge was awarded nearly 50 million in the 1990s the money was part of ambassador walter h annenbergs 500 million challenge to the nation whereby public private partnerships tried to improve public schools according to the annenberg institutes web site obama has said he deplored what ayers did in the 1960s and that by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the university of illinois we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education

8467902 if you want to perform self castration and ruin your manhood please do so in private but dont render the rest of american men impotent by sending the countrys top two ballbusting misandrists gynobama and vawa joe to the white house their victory in november is impossible without the male vote so if you elect them well know that you failed your testicular self exam

8467908 since when did open criticism of the current and obvious failure of the present political leadership come to mean
8467909 9 11 didnt you get the memo its the one bush didnt ignore
8467910 only now can we pull out because we have done our job in iraq and are now able to leave with victory and ensure that the region remains relatively stable after we leave
8467911 it will talk about how we can actually create more jobs in the country depart from energy dependence with an
8467912 having demonstrated how to lose millions of jobs perhaps they now are going to show us how well they can create new jobs
8467913 americas in trouble mccain will just carry on the same policies not a workable solution to turn the country around when youre suggesting we keep heading in the wrong direction i have 85 of america agreeing with me on that

8467922 i was down in the zone my slider was good and my two seamer also

8467930 its not serious but we need to do it he has been playing some games in pain not being 100 percent fit
8467931 he had a problem for the first leg with liege and when he went away with england for the friendly last week against the czech republic
8467932 we talked with the doctor yesterday and today and it was decided that steven would play in this match with the pain but now we will have to get the situation solved
8467933 acaso quer is que el lunes ya venga al entrenamiento conduciendo
8467934 it was really tough i am completely out of breath
8467935 i was pushed to the limit the last time i played her she was up 5 1 in third and i had to come back
8467936 i was concerned i was going to get my dress dirty
8467937 the most important thing is to stay positive in the difficult moments in the match and be able to win even when you feel tired
8467938 when i got into a dangerous situation so i started moving her around a little bit more in the second set i was able to gain more confidence
8467939 el ritmo del filial es diferente al del primer equipo a n me faltaba conocer los nuevos fichajes y poco a poco tengo que ir cogiendo la din mica de juego me encuentro muy c modo con la posici n que ocupo en el terreno de juego porque me gusta llegar desde atr s
8467940 el cambio que m s he notado en el paso de un equipo a otro es la manera de presionar al equipo rival luis enrique nos pide que estemos muy encima del rival y actuemos con m s intensidad y encima del contrario
8467941 si guardiola me necesita alg n d a ir encantado pero ahora estoy en el bar a atl tic y tengo que trabajar aqu lo que quiere todo jugador de la cantera es llegar al primer equipo y me he sentido bien jugando con ellos
8467942 i want everybody to now understand why i am so proud to have joe biden and the whole biden family
8467943 i think hes presented himself pretty well so far what do you think
8467944 no longer will the eight most dreaded words in the english language be the vice presidents office is on the phone
8467945 i know it you know it barack obama gets it
8467946 this is the time as americans together we get back up
8467947 these are extraordinary times this is an extraordinary election the american people are ready barack obama is ready this is his time this is our time this is americas time
8467948 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8467949 ive been on the ground in georgia iraq pakistan and afghanistan and i can tell you in no uncertain terms this administrations policy has been an abject failure
8467950 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8467951 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8467952 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8467953 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8467954 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8467955 be there because barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8467956 joe biden is right we need more than a good soldier we need a leader with the experience and judgment to serve as commander in chief from day one that leader is john mccain
8467957 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need

8467960 the person that brought it to my attention did ask does that mean if youre mute you cant play golf on the lpga tour
8467961 do you have to pass an exam who draws the line about how many words youve got to know in english
8467962 some people are natural talkers and some people arent what if you have a person who genuinely struggles with learning a new language they have a learning disability
8467963 there are people out there who dont naturally pick up second languages
8467964 if it does we wouldnt just say come back next year what we would do is work with them on where they fell short provide them the resources they need the tutoring
8467965 theres probably the potential for a lot more bad news to come from the banks in australia
8467966 i would have to be very sceptical of the dividend yields of the banks when there are capital constraints in place
8467967 the banks have shown in the past that dividend yields are the first to go
8467968 our uk banks have had to cut dividends and rights issues have not been taken up
8467969 anyone who thinks the credit crunch is over is kidding themselves we believe theres a long way to go in terms of write downs in the uk and the us as long as it runs i think you can expect some more negative news
8467970 now that the credit crunch is under way the next phase that we expect is that there will be a contraction among consumers it doesnt matter where monetary policy goes if banks cant lend then we will see their balance sheets get hit by a double whammy
8467971 the banks are up and the resources are leading the charge he said
8467972 we had quite a reasonable lead from the us overnight
8467973 there is a bit of life left in the old dog yet

8467997 when i saw them on the news i couldnt really see them
8467998 i wanted to turn the idea of a soldier on its head and look at them as vulnerable
8467999 i wanted to look in the face of a young person who has seen something that has marked their lives
8468000 whether or not you can see that in the photograph is another matter
8468001 out of context neither in a museum setting or website the images as stand alone highway or city billboards appear to be deceased soldiers the presentation in this manner could be perceived as being disrespectful to the men and women in our armed forces
8468002 whether people are in favor of this war or any war or against it know that people get killed and that war puts people in harms way
8468003 viewing these portraits of soldiers causes one to pause and think of the many sacrifices and efforts these men and women have experienced to protect us and defend this great country the portraits are a stark reminder of the reality of it all
8468004 for me looking at their faces serves also as a reminder to remember our service men and women and to thank them for all they do and have done i am disappointed that the billboards have been canceled and strongly hope the company will reconsider
8468005 if there was any deep division in the music scene in 1977 it wasnt people scratching their heads at less than stellar releases from kansas foreigner styx or steely dan and neil young it was the demise of live music as disco came to prominence i could make the argument that kansas nugent and other arena acts gained fans because people who hated disco really hated disco myself included
8468006 john jansens comments made me think of some of the bad things white people have done timothy mcveigh terry nichols the unabomber not to mention almost all the serial killers in the u s and all those arab terrorists theyre caucasian i just dont think we can afford to have white people running this country they are way too dangerous
8468007 i really used to be amazed how these individuals could be so blatant about who they really are and yet have their assemblies still pour money into their pockets so they can live like movie stars and then you have those who are of the new faith cashians and followers of santa christ
8468008 these are the people who gave us life they are the reason we are here today
8468009 if there was any deep division in the music scene in 1977 it wasnt people scratching their heads at less than stellar releases from kansas foreigner styx or steely dan and neil young it was the demise of live music as disco came to prominence i could make the argument that kansas nugent and other arena acts gained fans because people who hated disco really hated disco myself included

8468012 the operation is over we killed third militant early today thursday
8468013 some men worship rank some worship heroes some worship power some worship god and over these ideals they dispute and cannot unite but they all worship money
8468014 i talk about it because our sense of pride gives hope for other individuals too that kind of hope and pride inspires other people into action
8468015 for those who do not want to have that dialogue i recognize that but for those of us who are proud of this moment we are not going to squash that
8468016 if she were alive she would be immensely proud of my being the first african american mayor of columbus
8468017 but she would not have even conceived of the possibility that a black man or woman a person of color could become president of these united states of america
8468018 you dont run from your roots you embrace your past and you represent everybody
8468019 i couldnt believe what i was seeing now for me to be here
8468020 but with older people theres no way if you were born in my time and world to think that you would see this happen
8468021 there were certain things we knew we couldnt do you could have the second best grades but you knew when you were pushing up to the line and crossing over it
8468022 there are some people here that are afraid this may in some way take away from their status but this is not a black thing or a white thing
8468023 there are some majority people who are afraid of that but if were not all rowing in the same rhythm were going to go in a circle
8468024 being an african american and not being sensitive to the historic nature of this is just a fallacy
8468025 ive always been involved in politics but i always had to settle for this is the first time in my adult life ive been really excited this is going to show that americas precepts are not just rhetoric
8468026 its not so much that hes black thats why it is historic but thats not why people are excited whats exciting is that he is transcending
8468027 i want everybody to now understand why i am so proud to have joe biden and the whole biden family
8468028 i think hes presented himself pretty well so far what do you think

8468253 john jansens comments made me think of some of the bad things white people have done timothy mcveigh terry nichols the unabomber not to mention almost all the serial killers in the u s and all those arab terrorists theyre caucasian i just dont think we can afford to have white people running this country they are way too dangerous
8468254 i really used to be amazed how these individuals could be so blatant about who they really are and yet have their assemblies still pour money into their pockets so they can live like movie stars and then you have those who are of the new faith cashians and followers of santa christ

8468257 an atmospheric pressure drop at wind turbine blades is an undetectable and potentially unforeseeable hazard for bats thus partially explaining the large number of bat fatalities at these specific structures
8468258 people love to sit in their backyards and watch birds its much harder to watch bats because they are nocturnal
8468259 it was important for us to determine as much as we could about this issue
8468260 we had to be quite patient mainly because we were started from a knowledge base that wasnt quite zero but very very low
8468261 the garbage patch barfs and you get a beach covered with this confetti of plastic
8468262 had for some odd reason completely bypassed me until a couple of years ago i bought it and it had since been in my voluminous evergrowing pile of to read books now its also read exemplary modest in pages around 350 and with an as most always with irving ingenious story both sad and laughable on the burley side endlessly witty and well written this piece of irving paper work is far from a memorable favourite of mine cant really pinpoint as to why it just never completely captured me currently reading pile which can be seen to the right here in blog gt until i find you
8468263 new zealand is facing a serious economic challenge generated by the global credit crunch and steep rises in global commodity prices
8468264 these are the most complex and challenging set of economic forces we have confronted in at least two decades
8468265 it has good profitability and is well capitalised with strong liquidity these factors put us in a sound position for the current and expected economic environment
8468266 this has been particularly evident in the household sector which is carrying the burden of higher interest rates and the impact of higher food fuel and other costs
8468267 the individual provision for credit impairment charge remains less than 0 2 percent of total loans but is expected to rise further in the period ahead
8468268 set her food out on the picnic table and forgot her coat
8468269 went back to get her coat out of the car
8468270 the bear had gotten into her food and was having himself a good lunch
8468271 its just when we have a bear problem that its closed
8468272 once the bear gets food he knows thats an easy spot to come and get food again
8468273 it was just a nice little hour couple of hour hike in there but we didnt see any bears
8468274 what happened in utah is something we have been talking about for years the state law that effectively prohibits retail service is in my view a very substantial part of what is wrong with the environment in utah and particularly iprovo
8468275 if applications are slow to evolve and they have been service providers are left competing with incumbents on traditional services where they have no advantages
8468276 this is a great example of how a non wireless camera can be optimized for the eye fi card to create the best experience possible
8468277 i want to express my anger and frustration as a man with the women i feel are miseducated misinformed and ill prepared about their responsibilities in getting and maintaining a relationship with a man of quality

8468279 my mother used to say walk them home from school grab their books give them gifts blah blah blah yada yada yada

8468283 the spirit of man triumphed most utterly over his part in his mind if kids rock painting imagine some obscure painter quoting the style of the boats instead of being undressed or rather three soils each carrying its peculiar vegetation there
8468284 give kids rock painting to good advantage in his sisters skirts the attempt to propel the craft and to neglect
8468285 somehow kids rock painting believe kids rock painting would have expected because kids rock painting were to be made of light and colour as though his knees struck the half hour youd better fetch lingnam over electric railroads kids rock painting went to board and lodge with kids rock painting paul
8468286 do you speak any language that non gibbering idiots can understand just as the strength of a solitary brick will not save a poorly built structure your bold typeface does not redeem your craven incoherent words

8468301 are you kidding talk about being for it before youre against it
8468302 to those who still believe in the myth of a maverick instead of the reality of a politician i say lets compare senator mccain to candidate mccain
8468303 let me tell you before he ever debates barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself
8468304 four years ago you gave me the honor of fighting our fight
8468305 president obama and vice president biden will shut down guantanamo
8468306 we must listen and lead by example because even a nation as powerful as the united states needs some friends in this world
8468307 we need a leader who understands all our security challenges not just bombs and guns but global warming global terror and global aids
8468308 time and again barack obama has seen farther thought harder and listened better
8468309 today bushs diplomats are doing exactly what obama said talking with iran
8468310 instead the informal two page document iran distributed at nuclear talks in geneva on saturday ignored the main demand from six nations on curbing irans enrichment of uranium and called for concessions from the other side according to a copy obtained by the new york times
8468311 responded immediately with the outdated thinking of the cold war
8468312 how insulting to suggest that those who question the mission question the troops
8468313 you know education if you make the most of it you study hard you do your homework and you make an effort to be smart you can do well if you dont you get stuck in iraq
8468314 doesnt belong to any political party it is an enduring symbol of our nation
8468315 we were surprised by how much difference there was between the antioxidant activity of the raspberries vs the other fruits
8468316 thats a much higher reduction than i thought wed see
8468317 this suggests that berries bind up a good portion of free radicals preventing them from causing damage in the body
8468318 the results of this study would translate in humans to eating two large bowls or four cups of fresh black raspberries each day
8468319 that may seem a bit extreme people need to know that these animals are given whopping doses of a carcinogen its conceivable that a much lower dose would be effective in humans
8468320 were just suggesting that people make one of those helpings berries
8468321 we want something to show students were really doing something at lafayette
8468322 we have to be a lot more thoughtful about where our food sources come from how theyre grown the environmental impact

8468327 love your enemies bless those who curse you do good to those who hate you and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you
8468328 our goal has always been to put the best tools in the hands of merchants and affiliates enabling them to do what they do best from an affiliate perspective i feel we have done that in this case by allowing them to focus on things like merchandising and content and not on trying to create a video player or worrying about tracking video content is an area of enormous growth potential as everyone recognizes and the only hurdle for merchants and affiliates alike seemed to be the actual technical tracking so we targeted our efforts there once a video is shot it takes no more than 5 10 minutes to generate a full featured video creative which they can then use immediately
8468329 como muchas parejas hemos pasado por uno de esos momentos que nadie quiere que ocurra pero cuando pasan son una especie de invitaci n a reflexionar sobre lo que de verdad queremos tanto mi esposo como yo estamos totalmente enfocados y deseosos que esta relaci n prospere como creyentes sabemos que contamos con el apoyo de dios en este proceso
8468330 the text is wrong it says that thoreau followed a path by the river that led to the wilderness bob he was a bushwhacker he avoided paths at any cost he was a river wader he was so engrossed with the idea of being one with nature that he got into the river and waded in the water right up to his nose

8468333 from the shore to the sideshow a tour of the history and future of coney island
8468334 that was the most fabulous welcome back i have ever been involved with
8468335 they were on the flight with us and part of the team
8468336 i havent spoken to them but they know there are consequences to actions
8468337 it is a bit of tomfoolery which went a step too far
8468338 it was a great team to be part of which was why that was a disappointment because it was a team that respected supported one another
8468339 i am very happy very proud i have done a country of four million people and my family proud my parents

8468341 cu l es la corresponsabilidad que debemos asumir desde los medios es v lido por ejemplo difundir versiones sobre el tr mite de un rescate cuando la vida de una persona est en juego y cuando esas versiones resultan ser infundadas es v lido difundir los mensajes de los narcotraficantes difundir sus amenazas y extorsiones
8468342 pero tampoco podemos ser tan ingenuos o tan poco responsables como para hacerle el juego a la delincuencia
8468343 whatever else history may say about me when im gone i hope it will record that i appealed to your best hopes not your worst fears to your confidence rather than your doubts my dream is that you will travel the road ahead with libertys lamp guiding your steps and opportunitys arm steadying your way
8468344 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal
8468345 people have been seduced into believing that they can live in symbiosis with the state that is killing what little liberty and prosperity we still enjoy we have succumbed to the lure of what bastiat called institutionalized plunder fallen prey to the temptation to employ the states coercive power to live at the expense of others and now weve reached a point where a simple weeding even a thorough one wont suffice something much more invasive more catastrophic will be required to beat down the states overgrowth and clear the field so that freedom can flourish and genuinely civilized life can recover
8468346 you too man im in the same situation but i bet mines worse its been 1 year 3 months for me you
8468347 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
8468348 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure on the british government
8468349 its very clear we need to deliver any agreements that weve had with the dup and the two governments the devolution of policing and justice has to happen we in our party have worked for years and are very committed to the process under way but we need to start seeing results
8468350 we have agreements in terms of justice and policing in terms of the irish
8468351 its not a case of threatening anything its just a case of recommitting ourselves to actually delivering
8468352 it hasnt amounted to very much quite frankly we are hopeful that when peter
8468353 but be very clear about this we need the devolution of policing and justice powers as agreed we need the irish language act we need all the outstanding issues resolved we are committed to delivering that we need the dup and everyone else on board
8468354 these young people showed wanton disregard of the good name of their area never mind the safety of the people who were passing through at the time
8468355 it is very disappointing that we had a number of young people gathered last
8468356 it is just unacceptable and very very regrettable that what was a small number of young people have caused this damage
8468357 they are giving the city a bad name and we have worked so hard to move away
8468358 some of these kids are as young as primary school age and really the parents
8468359 we reassert our strong and continued support for georgias sovereignty within its internationally recognized borders and underline our respect and support for the democratic and legitimate government of georgia as we pursue a peaceful durable solution to this conflict
8468360 underlined the urgent neccessity to lower tension and to fully apply the six points of the ceasefire agreement
8468361 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aide using battleships
8468362 any attempts to jeopardise this atmosphere of cooperation would not only have a negative impact for russia but will definitely harm the economic interests of those states
8468363 oh that looks thought provoking ill give it a try

8468372 i know this girl is not involved in the security forces
8468373 i totally condemn anyone who targets anyone like this can you imagine how
8468374 shes left her home at present because she doesnt want to be opening the door and she doesnt want people driving past the house and firing at it
8468375 i believe there is an onus on the security forces to get that message out
8468376 this is very serious in an area where there has been an upsurge in dissident republican activity this is very worrying especially when it comes against a background of fewer resources being made available to the psni who have to operate on a reduced budget
8468377 a meeting of the executive has been scheduled for thursday september 18 if this meeting were not to take place it is self evident that there would be serious consequences for the good government of northern ireland and indeed potentially for those who refuse to fulfil their legal obligations
8468378 however the behaviour of sinn fein has undoubtedly damaged confidence and in so doing will hinder the speed of progress more precisely by virtue of the consequences of responding to such threats the dup will not further progress this matter in the absence of a properly functioning executive
8468379 the dup does not believe there would be support for the devolution of policing and justice if sinn fein ministers were to have responsibility for any policing and justice function furthermore it is clear that a policing and justice minister could not be subject to the vagaries of an executive which can be subject to the kind of behaviour we have recently witnessed
8468380 we have a lot of evidence it is like a jigsaw puzzle we have got most of the jigsaw it is just trying to put everything together
8468381 more and more people are dying through cancer related illnesses and
8468382 the seminar is about giving people the information we have
8468383 when the gas was pumped in we all knew there was something different
8468384 you were incapacitated in the 70s with cs gas you cried your eyes
8468385 we actually dont know the full story but we do know that we
8468386 the seminar is to announce what direction we believe the the campaign should take
8468387 the fact is that there were all these relatively young men from late 40s to early 50s dying from various cancers
8468388 we are in the process of putting a database together but it is definitely significant
8468389 we want people to come to the seminar and listen to what we are saying
8468390 the bottom line here is that there was a major human rights violation on prisoners
8468391 man i dont know how to do that math shit im bad at algebra
8468392 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you

8468397 i simply dont think that the people of florida are gonna say the nominee of our party ought to be a person who on more than one occasion has expressed lack of understanding of our economy at a time when the economy is the number one issue that people are talking about
8468398 im deeply disappointed the republican party seems poised to select a nominee who did not support a constitutional amendment to protect the institution of marriage who has little regard for freedom of speech and has a legendary temper and often uses foul and obscene language
8468399 john mccain on foreign policy even worse than bush the foreign policy that john mccain now advocates is reckless and promiscuously interventionist if he were a university student majoring in international relations or security studies he would deserve a resounding f for his analysis of the crucial issues that the united states has confronted over the past 14 or 15 years
8468400 the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me

8468416 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world he is ready to be president of the united states
8468417 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8468418 the job of the next president is to rebuild the american dream and restore americas standing in the world barack obama is the man for this job
8468419 i always said that the more that axl and geffen jerked around trying to figure out how to release this finally finished album that weve all been waiting over 13 years for the greater the chances would be that it would slip out of a pressing plant or office somewhere and wind up in the hands of some asshole with a blog
8468420 so remember when we let you guys listen to some allegedly ha new guns n roses songs we got our hands on
8468421 well either way the fbi sure does theyve been investigating and talking to me about that event ever since if there are any lawyers out there horny for some high profile copyright law battle drop us a line

8468430 i want everybody to now understand why i am so proud to have joe biden and the whole biden family
8468431 i think hes presented himself pretty well so far what do you think
8468432 we want to make sure that everybody who wants to come and join in the party and join in the effort to take this country back
8468433 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8468434 no longer will the eight most dreaded words in the english language be the vice presidents office is on the phone
8468435 i know it you know it barack obama gets it
8468436 this is the time as americans together we get back up
8468437 these are extraordinary times this is an extraordinary election the american people are ready barack obama is ready this is his time this is our time this is americas time
8468438 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8468439 ive been on the ground in georgia iraq pakistan and afghanistan and i can tell you in no uncertain terms this administrations policy has been an abject failure
8468440 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8468441 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8468442 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8468443 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8468444 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8468445 be there because barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8468446 joe biden is right we need more than a good soldier we need a leader with the experience and judgment to serve as commander in chief from day one that leader is john mccain
8468447 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8468448 theres no way im going to vote for one of these two clowns

8468463 con la sabidur a y experiencia de joe biden apoyando la demostrada comprensi n intuici n y buenos instintos de barack obama estados unidos tendr el liderazgo en seguridad nacional que necesitamos
8468464 quiero que todos los que la apoyaron a hillary voten en noviembre por barack obama
8468465 los republicanos dijeron que yo era demasiado joven y demasiado inexperimentado para ser comandante en jefe de las fuerzas armadas
8468466 no funcion en 1992 porque est bamos del lado correcto de la historia y no funcionar en el 2008 porque barack obama est del lado correcto de la historia
8468467 he did a tremendous job to save the bullpen for us
8468468 i like the way he was throwing the ball i think that is the best thing that happened tonight for us for real we were so bad that was the best thing that happened
8468469 i was pretty bad theres no other way of putting it i was just flat out bad i didnt even give us a chance to win broadway did a decent job but my job is to get us into the seventh and eighth inning with the lead or tied and i didnt even get us into the fifth inning
8468470 i feel good but i didnt have command of anything catcher a j pierzynski would call a fastball in and id throw it away my breaking stuff wasnt there it just wasnt there my changeup was up i was just flat out bad
8468471 john did not throw the ball the way we have seen him throw the ball those kind of days you wish it would be a different way i always say pitchers dictate how we play the game unfortunately we did not bring anything to the ballgame
8468472 i dont know what to say i feel good the stuff is still there its a matter of me doing it and i didnt do it
8468473 if they were struggling and they were tired then it would be like wow we have to go to plan b but they seem to be throwing the ball fine both of them danks that was the worst day ive seen him delivering the ball but i dont think it was because he was tired i think he couldnt find the strike zone
8468474 i wish i could fast forward this boston series and get back on the mound in cleveland theres just no other way to put it i was just flat out awful and hopefully i can put this behind me soon
8468475 you have a man running for president on the democratic ticket who believes in selective infanticide joined by a pro abortion catholic with delegates at the convention which are wildly out of step with what americans feel about this serious subject and you have the speaker of the house who doesnt even know what her religion teaches about the subject
8468476 if he obama were to come to you and say help me out here madame speaker when does life begin what would you tell him
8468477 i would say as an ardent practicing catholic uh this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8468478 and saint augustine said at three months we dont know the point is that it shouldnt have an impact on a womans right to choose
8468479 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception
8468480 to misrepresent what the catholic church teaches on the subject and which the catechism has said that from the first century the catholic church has been opposed to abortion that its never changed its teaching on the subject and when she said ive been studying this for a long time one has to wonder about her cognitive abilities
8468481 there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
8468482 the churchs moral teaching never justified or permitted abortion at any stage of development
8468483 is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
8468484 these are the earliest copies of the bible ever found
8468485 the bible is sacred to us and to you and to all the monotheistic religions and therefore the scrolls are national treasures and world treasures and therefore it is our duty to preserve them at least for 2 000 years more
8468486 they show the connection between christianity judaism and how everything evolved from the god the god is one god
8468487 just by applying the latest infrared technologies and shooting at very high detail lots of resolution we are already opening up new characters from the scrolls that are either extremely indistinct or you just couldnt see them before
8468488 to switch over to digital is really the way to go and people were resistant to it initially because it was a new way of doing stuff
8468489 you can see where the ink has broken away and you can see the texture of the animal skin so you can see more detail than you can see with the naked eye
8468490 it shows that the nations capacity to assimilate new immigrants is strong
8468491 its easier to make progress to the next level up
8468492 one of the top five origin countries was england and close to 100 percent of them spoke english
8468493 if youre in the country illegally a lot of the avenues of assimilation are cut off to you
8468494 there are lot of jobs you cant get and you cant become a citizen
8468495 at least thats two less i have to worry about
8468496 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8468497 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8468498 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8468499 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8468500 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8468501 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8468502 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8468503 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8468504 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win

8468511 certainly there were commentators and other pundits at fox news that were useful to the white house

8468513 you know people talk about albert pujols but a sleeper pick might be ryan ludwick
8468514 the whole purpose is to bring attention to the plastic marine debris issue
8468515 so theres a small particulate of plastic little small pea sized fragments was in every sample so we have in 50 years have turned our ocean into a plastic soup
8468516 the solution we think is to end the age of disposable plastic like plastic bags water bottles single use plastics have no use in modern society
8468517 when it was shown to him he was very very pleased indeed
8468518 he could only widen his eyes or something like that but it was explained to him and he was thrilled
8468519 it probably did as much as the injections they were giving him
8468520 doctors dont usually make predictions but they are predicting that within three days they will be able to feed him solids and that should build up his strength
8468521 the coalition will oppose the rudd labor governments punitive 30 per cent increase in the so called luxury car tax
8468522 it is the politics of envy which will increase inflation
8468523 the highest selling so called luxury car is the toyota landcruiser which retails for around 70 000 and are driven primarily by those in rural and regional australia and those with the need for a people mover
8468524 the opposition has decided to stand up for lower taxes on luxury cars rather than for lower interest rates for working families
8468525 we really dont celebrate the misfortune and sentence of anybody but we do celebrate the law the system we live in and we do feel justice has prevailed in this case
8468526 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8468527 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8468528 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8468529 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8468530 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8468531 even in this place in the valley of the dead we can smell blood and shit pain misery and suffering have their own scents as well there are those who make their living detecting the scents and others who feed off it
8468532 no but theyre not going anywhere any time soon either
8468533 how the hell can you say they got off lucky
8468534 they still have their heads their scalps their faces i could go on but mackensies still out there so i wont waste my breath your daughters still alive caroline just think on that
8468535 caroline the lesson you should learn from this moment the lesson you should hold on to is to never ask a question unless you really want to know the answer
8468536 our brave soldiers were killed because of their reckless incompetence
8468537 our brave soldiers were killed by a ruthless enemy in iraq and if senators bayh biden and obama had had their way we would have left iraq in defeat
8468538 passage of the joint resolution that would authorize the use of force against iraq and require the administration to report to congress that diplomatic options have been exhausted before or within 48 hours after military action has begun the president also would be required to submit a progress report to congress at least every 60 days
8468539 one of the principal sponsors of the iraq war resolution
8468540 well sean let me remind you i was one of the principal sponsors of the iraq resolution along with senator lieberman
8468541 the only way to remove saddam i think was through the use of force
8468542 we have to finish the job we owe it not only to the troops who sacrificed their lives but also the iraqi people
8468543 obama continued all of us assume that when we make that commitment that we have to finish the job we owe it not only to the troops who sacrificed their lives but also the iraqi people
8468544 obama in never before aired nightline interview from 2004 praises john kerrys experience disses cut and run proposals from iraq

8468548 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barrack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
8468549 explain that relationship for the voters and explain to democrats why it wont be a problem
8468550 the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when i was 8 years old somehow reflects on me and my values doesnt make much sense to me
8468551 your station is committed to operating in the public interest an objective that cannot be satisfied by accepting for compensation material of such malicious falsity
8468552 must not be empty talk if the united states moves on a road to intensify confrontation with the north it may lead to a situation where the hands of the denuclearization clock may run backward

8468557 one of our broader concerns is what iran is doing elsewhere in this hemisphere and what it could do if we were to find ourselves in some kind of confrontation with iran
8468558 it preserves the capability of hezbollah and the revolutionary guard to mount attacks inside latin america it is very very important to iran and hezbollah right now

8468562 unless the state of texas violates their own election laws congressman barr will be the only presidential candidate on the ballot
8468563 we are up against them constantly in our fight to get on the ballot across the nation when we miss deadlines we get no second chances this is a great example of how unreasonable deadlines chill democracy
8468564 republicans and democrats make certain that third party candidates are held to ballot access laws no matter how absurd or unreasonable
8468565 therefore republicans and democrats should be held to the same standards
8468566 hes already an expert but i guess it doesnt hurt to read up

8468601 were prepared to have an argument if thats necessary you cant simply allow our kids to be in schools which are consistently underperforming
8468602 whats not smart is having underperforming schools year after year decade after decade not even measuring it not even recognising its happening and not even doing anything about it
8468603 what you should measure is if youve got like student populations and you can see one school thats rocketing up the attainment level and the other school thats falling behind then you can go into this school and say whats happening here what are the teachers doing whats the principal doing what are the parents doing thats making a difference
8468604 you can take that best practice to the school thats falling behind
8468605 the real challenge for mr rudd is will he now withhold funding from those state government and non government schools that do not comply

8468697 were prepared to have an argument if thats necessary you cant simply allow our kids to be in schools which are consistently underperforming
8468698 whats not smart is having underperforming schools year after year decade after decade not even measuring it not even recognising its happening and not even doing anything about it
8468699 what you should measure is if youve got like student populations and you can see one school thats rocketing up the attainment level and the other school thats falling behind then you can go into this school and say whats happening here what are the teachers doing whats the principal doing what are the parents doing thats making a difference
8468700 you can take that best practice to the school thats falling behind
8468701 the real challenge for mr rudd is will he now withhold funding from those state government and non government schools that do not comply

8468717 social media is a type of word of mouth marketing so the best way to measure is to look at share of voice online for example we did a push for a tournament for an online game that we created and we got more than 35 press and blog hits about it the amount that we wouldve had to pay for banner ads or email campaigns to get that same coverage of the promotion wouldve been high thats where you can really see the cost benefits and the roi

8468729 the coalition will oppose the rudd labor governments punitive 30 per cent increase in the so called luxury car tax
8468730 it is the politics of envy which will increase inflation
8468731 the highest selling so called luxury car is the toyota landcruiser which retails for around 70 000 and are driven primarily by those in rural and regional australia and those with the need for a people mover
8468732 the opposition has decided to stand up for lower taxes on luxury cars rather than for lower interest rates for working families
8468733 the labor members of a senate committee have decided to rush out a report which endorses labor policy
8468734 the reality is that fuelwatch will not only not put the price of petrol down it will actually increase it
8468735 fuelwatch is nothing more than foolwatch and those labor mps that have decided to endorse it are doing nothing more than following mr rudd
8468736 its a rather unusual step that a senate committee would put out an interim report the purpose of which is to do nothing more than to deceive the independent senators
8468737 fuelwatch is sham it has the potential to push up the price of fuel for motorists its nothing more than a quick fix for kevin rudd the committee has failed to justify its position
8468738 the analysis by the accc has been criticised the committee travelled the width and breadth of the country and struggled to find anyone who would support this hare brained scheme
8468739 certainly the accs work is certainly subject to some considerable question
8468740 fuelwatch is working against independent petrol retailers in western australia in fact many have closed down since the introduction
8468741 there were 200 independent petrol retailers before fuelwatch there are now 17

8468758 our goal has always been to put the best tools in the hands of merchants and affiliates enabling them to do what they do best from an affiliate perspective i feel we have done that in this case by allowing them to focus on things like merchandising and content and not on trying to create a video player or worrying about tracking video content is an area of enormous growth potential as everyone recognizes and the only hurdle for merchants and affiliates alike seemed to be the actual technical tracking so we targeted our efforts there once a video is shot it takes no more than 5 10 minutes to generate a full featured video creative which they can then use immediately

8468779 there are files from all kinds of sources that we want to store and manage files are created by our digital cameras e mail cell phones portable media players camcorders pdas and laptops increasingly computer users are using different folders drives and even different computers such as a laptop and a desktop to store manage retrieve and view files yet managing hundreds or thousands of files is still largely a manual operation in some cases it is necessary to regularly get copies of files from another location to add to primary location in other cases there is a need to keep two storage locations exactly in sync some users manage files manually dragging and dropping from one place to another and keeping track of whether the locations are synchronized in their heads other users may use two or more applications to provide this functionality now there is an easier way synctoy a free powertoy for microsoft windows is an easy to use highly customizable program that helps users to do the heavy lifting involved with the copying moving and synchronization of different directories most common operations can be performed with just a few clicks of the mouse and additional customization is available without additional complexity synctoy can manage multiple sets of folders at the same time it can combine files from two folders in one case and mimic renames and deletes in another case unlike other applications synctoy actually keeps track of renames to file s and will make sure those changes get carried over to the synchronized folder

8468811 the campaign generated so much heat it increased global warming
8468812 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to commander in chief
8468813 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history

8468823 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8468824 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8468825 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8468826 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8468827 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8468828 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8468844 we are moving to a system where we can compare apples with apples he said
8468845 i notice the liberals were saying that they had come up with some of these ideas in the past well thats terrific
8468846 twelve years they were in government 24 reports on boosting quality education in our schools and not much to show for it in terms of real action
8468847 from what we have seen it appears to be essentially a reheated coalition policy much of which has already been legislated he said
8468848 its punitive its saying principals perform or heads will roll she told reporters
8468849 its shifting responsibility for the educational outcomes of the nation onto the shoulders of principals and making them personally responsible when the government isnt adequately funding schools to be able to do the job
8468850 theres no point in the world with comparing a rich school on sydneys north shore with elizabeth north in south australia and how the school is going there she said

8468856 historically australia hasnt been considered a country that has a problem with corruption it was ranked in the top ten nations in the global corruption perception index1 from 2003 to 2007 however australias rank slipped to 11 in 2007 following the australian wheat board oil for food scandal
8468857 recent allegations of corruption within railcorp wollongong council and nsw fire brigades highlight a need for greater focus on bribery and corruption measures in australia
8468858 this report looks at an organisations ability to disclose information on counter corruption programs and performance it would appear that top australian companies are creating anti corruption policies and codes of conduct but most are not transparent in how those policies are governed implemented and reviewed
8468859 companies that report on anti corruption programs show they take responsibility for their and their employees behaviour and understand the negative effect a bribery or corruption scandal would have on their organisation
8468860 australian organisations need to improve reporting transparency to meet international standards and show that they are safeguarding their companies their reputation and the economy against corrupt behaviour
8468861 companies operating in high risk sectors should be adopting a more rigorous approach to bribery and corruption disclosure in particular multinational mining corporations operate in countries that rank poorly in the global corruption perception index and are therefore more susceptible to bribery and corrupt behaviour
8468862 only 12 of the high risk 21 adhere to or employ internationally recognised standards against bribery and corruption and across the asx50 the average score is just 27 this review shows there is much to be done to improve the transparency in reporting of countering bribery and corruption

8469040 from one flip flopper who would say anything to get elected to another mr mccain
8469041 i have known and been friends with senator john mccain for almost 22 years
8469042 but every day now i learn something new about candidate mccain to those who still believe in the myth of the maverick instead of the reality of the politician i say lets compare senator mccain to candidate mccain
8469043 candidate mccain now supports the wartime tax cuts that senator mccain once denounced as immoral candidate mccain criticizes senator mccains own climate change bill candidate mccain says he would not vote against the immigration bill john mccain wrote are you kidding talk about being for it before being against it before he ever debates barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself
8469044 and the tanks rolled into georgia we saw john mccain respond immediately with the outdated thinking of the cold war
8469045 when we called for a timetable to make iraqis stand up for iraq and bring our heroes home john mccain called it cut and run but today even president bush has seen the light he and prime minister maliki agree on guess what a timetable
8469046 four years ago i said and i say it again tonight that the flag doesnt belong to any ideology it doesnt belong to any political party it is an enduring symbol of our nation and it belongs to all the american people after all patriotism is not love of power or some cheap trick to win votes patriotism is love of country

8469094 a nova linha da pobreza de us 1 25 revela que em 1981 havia 1 9 bih o de pessoas vivendo com essa quantia diariamente ao contr rio da antiga margem que considerava que 1 5 bilh o sobrevivia com us 1 00 por dia de acordo com o novo c lculo em 2004 havia 1 4 bilh es de pessoas vivendo com us 1 25 di rios com a margem antiga 985 milh es viviam com us 1 00 salvo a china que vem conseguindo resultados positivos no combate contra a pobreza o mundo continua vendo um aumento no n mero de miser veis nos ltimos 25 anos inclusive na am rica latina at mesmo a ndia que alegava ser um exemplo de crescimento demonstra ter um n mero maior de pobres hoje que em 1981 em termos absolutos o rec lculo da linha da pobreza foi feito a partir de novos dados obtidos pelos economistas do banco e que chegaram conclus o de que a antiga medida de pobreza us 1 00 n o era adequada para avaliar a situa o da humanidade para a entidade a eleva o da linha da pobreza para us 1 25 reflete de forma mais adequada a realidade das popula es a nova medida foi feita com base em estudos que h tr s anos est o sendo feitos pelos economistas do banco mundial um n mero maior de pessoas em 116 pa ses foi entrevistado para que a entidade determinasse a nova linha da pobreza
8469095 o resultado das condi es de vida de cada popula o chocou at mesmo os especialistas
8469096 as estimativas sobre os pre os e renda comprovaram que esses n meros de quantidade de pobres eram muito baixos
8469097 as novas estimativas representam um avan o importante na tentativa de medir a pobreza
8469098 os novos dados confirmam que o mundo provavelmente conseguir atingir a meta de reduzir pela metade o n mero de pobres entre 1990 e 2015 e que a pobreza vem caindo em 1 ao ano desde 1981 afirmou justin lin economista chefe do banco mundial
8469099 mas a not cia ruim de que a pobreza maior que pens vamos significa que precisamos redobrar nossos esfor os principalmente na frica
8469100 mas diante do crescimento populacional esse progresso percentual n o foi suficiente para reduzir o n mero de pobres fora da china

8469122 so this cup of rain water makes you pretty happy
8469123 what to make of michelle obamas use of the terms the world as it is and the world as it should be
8469124 try chapter 2 of saul alinksys book rules for radicals
8469125 in last nights speech michelle obama said something that piqued my curiosity
8469126 she said barack stood up that day talking about a visit to chicago neighborhoods and spoke words that have stayed with me ever since
8469127 and all of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
8469128 the means and ends moralists constantly obsessed with the ethics of the means used by the have nots against the haves should search themselves as to their real political position in fact they are passive but real allies of the haves the most unethical of all means is the non use of any means the standards of judgment must be rooted in the whys and wherefores of life as it is lived the world as it is not our wished for fantasy of the world as it should be
8469129 after college obama moved to chicago to be part of the jerry kellman organization as a community organizer among the primary goals of alinsky was radical socialism and redistribution of wealth alinsky taught his proteges to hide their true goals by any means necessary lying was fine the objective of alinsky and kellman was to turn people against the white establishment
8469130 with the rule of law and individual freedom and liberty pursuit of happiness all of these things capitalism free markets
8469131 under assault by an entire political party and a class a political class of leftists who are everywhere including in the drive by media
8469132 they seek power to deny others liberty they may think theyre doing it all for the common good but they pose a great threat to me for the future of this country as we know it and as you would like for it to remain for your kids and your grandkids and their kids and grandkids
8469133 so we have a candidate who no sane political party would dare nominate a guy like this im not talking about anything other than he has no experience hes got no achievements but his associations with genuine america hating radicals occasionally cause him to say things that lead me to believe hes bought into a lot of what hes heard i think hes bought into it and i think he repeats it i think he is the formation of an indoctrination that has occurred to him his whole life and now he seeks the presidency
8469134 these associations and these ideas the lack of specificity from this guy all we have is what we know and what we know is not flattering so i think its imperative that all of these things be spoken so as you can be informed and people understand that this is not about image its not about hope its not about change its not about all these meaningless vapid nothings presidential elections matter greatly and this one does too if we end up with the wrong group of people running this country from the top down its going to take years to straighten it out and fix it
8469135 for every goal there must be a purpose the higher the purpose the more likely you will achieve it
8469136 i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
8469137 false catechesis then any course of action which seems likely to result in a community breaking communion with the church but continuing to function as a worshipping liturgical community clearly does nothing at all to protect the community members from false catechesis
8469138 yes but they will no longer be catechised in that way by or with the endorsement of the church of brisbane
8469139 the mercury theaters own radio version of dressing up in a sheet and jumping out of a bush and saying boo
8469140 its always important to know what our faith actually teaches
8469141 the future of a community a people a church and a nation depends on the children who will inherit it
8469142 if we prevent our children from being born we remove ourselves from the future its really that simple no children no future
8469143 the promise of tomorrow will be better than their yesterdays and thats in trouble and mccain doesnt know it barack obama knows it he worked hard
8469144 after 7 long years even bush recognizes that barack obama is right
8469145 now you know why i am so proud to have joe biden jill biden beau biden mama biden as my vice president
8469146 emotional needs by signing a non aggression pact with the mullocracy
8469147 off the table he has spoken of impeaching president bush if he attacks irans nuclear installations
8469148 biden said that the best deterrent to prevent pre emptive military action n iran is to make it clear even if it is at the end of bushs final term action will be taken against bush to ensure his legacy will be marred for all time
8469149 seems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for 200 million to iran
8469150 senator kennedy killed that girl the same as if he put a gun to her head and pulled the trigger
8469151 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia
8469152 with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds
8469153 how did it come about that highly sensitive technical information was given to the chinese why did the president ignore the national security experts who counseled against this deal what damage has been done to our national security
8469154 lone ranger work has taken him dangerously close to the neighborhood of what we used to call treason
8469155 indeed some of israels best friends and most articulate defenders can be found in the blogosphere little green footballs atlas shrugs hugh hewitt and debbie schlussel all provide a refreshing alternative to the moral relativism and politically correct anti israel blather of the media
8469156 we are perishing for want of wonder not for want of wonders
8469157 if you can become aware of the miraculousness which i symbolise you can help save the freedom mankind is unhappily losing
8469158 official dignity repute esteem a keen sense of right and wrong adherence to actions or principles considered right integrity to bring respect
8469159 if anyone serves me let him follow me and where i am there my servant will be also if anyone serves me him my father will honor
8469160 he who is not with me is against me and he who does not gather with me scatters abroad
8469161 this people honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me and in vain they worship me teaching as doctrine the commandments of men
8469162 an unprecedented opportunity for a community that is underrepresented on television
8469163 there is no doubt that it was a great missed opportunity to prevent people like you who shaped the minds of the generation to come to israel and perform
8469164 in the long run it is a lousy way to buy something
8469165 at least my mommy likes me enough to do this
8469166 young lady you are not going out of the house in that
8469167 seven hours in the library and no sleep im not feeling stellar
8469168 now some they do and some they dont and some you just cant tell and some they will and some they wont with some its just as well you can laugh at my behavior thatll never bother me say the devil is my savior but i dont pay no heed and i will go on shining shining like brand new ill never look behind me my troubles will be few
8469169 and when youre up on the stage its so unbelievable unforgettable how they adore you but then your wife seems to think youre losing your sanity oh calamity is there no way out does it feel that you lifes become a catastrophe oh it has to be for you to grow boy when you look through the years and see what you could have been oh what might have been if youd had more time so when the day comes to settle down whos to blame if youre not around you took the long way home
8469170 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8469171 as president barack will choose diplomacy first and military force as a last resort but in a world troubled by terror by trafficking in weapons and drugs and people by human rights abuses of the most horrible kind by other threats to our security our interests and our values when he cannot confront our adversaries into partners he will stand up to them
8469172 people all over the world have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8469173 i will never forget the parents of children with autism and other severe conditions who told me on the campaign trail that they couldnt afford health care and couldnt qualify their kids for medicaid unless they quit work or got a divorce are these the family values republicans are so proud of
8469174 to every thing there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born and a time to die
8469175 wouldnt it be cool if you and neil and alton could go riding together find or cook some really great food and just hang out
8469176 if you could have dinner with any famous person historical figure celebrity etc who would it be
8469177 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8469178 right now were sending 5 000 red cross volunteers from across the country down there so were ready no matter how big the storm is the red cross will be ready to help
8469179 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8469180 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8469181 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8469182 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8469183 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8469184 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8469185 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8469186 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8469187 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win
8469188 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8469189 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8469190 ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be the president of the united states
8469191 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8469192 actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8469193 barack obama and i took very different journeys to this destination but we share a common story
8469194 mine began in scranton pennsylvania and then wilmington delaware with a dad who fell on hard economic times but who always told me champ when you get knocked down get up get up my mothers creed is the american creed no one is better than you you are everyones equal and everyone is equal to you
8469195 you can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure
8469196 you learn about the strength of his mind but even more importantly you learn about the quality of his heart i watched how he touched people how he inspired them and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8469197 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running he would have been a senator longer by the time hes inaugurated but essentially once you start running for president full time you dont have time to do much else
8469198 but god demonstrates his own love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us
8469199 the coalition will oppose the rudd labor governments punitive 30 per cent increase in the so called luxury car tax
8469200 it is the politics of envy which will increase inflation
8469201 the highest selling so called luxury car is the toyota landcruiser which retails for around 70 000 and are driven primarily by those in rural and regional australia and those with the need for a people mover
8469202 the opposition has decided to stand up for lower taxes on luxury cars rather than for lower interest rates for working families
8469203 the labor members of a senate committee have decided to rush out a report which endorses labor policy
8469204 the reality is that fuelwatch will not only not put the price of petrol down it will actually increase it
8469205 fuelwatch is nothing more than foolwatch and those labor mps that have decided to endorse it are doing nothing more than following mr rudd
8469206 its a rather unusual step that a senate committee would put out an interim report the purpose of which is to do nothing more than to deceive the independent senators
8469207 fuelwatch is sham it has the potential to push up the price of fuel for motorists its nothing more than a quick fix for kevin rudd the committee has failed to justify its position
8469208 the analysis by the accc has been criticised the committee travelled the width and breadth of the country and struggled to find anyone who would support this hare brained scheme
8469209 certainly the accs work is certainly subject to some considerable question
8469210 fuelwatch is working against independent petrol retailers in western australia in fact many have closed down since the introduction
8469211 there were 200 independent petrol retailers before fuelwatch there are now 17
8469212 we stand today on the edge of a new frontier the frontier of the 1960s a frontier of unknown opportunities and perils a frontier of unfulfilled hopes and threats
8469213 beyond that frontier are the uncharted areas of science and space unsolved problems of peace and war unconquered pockets of ignorance and prejudice unanswered questions of poverty and surplus
8469214 if the point is to islamicize obama for the ignorant wingnut masses why include any photos of ayers he doesnt fit the profile of an islamic terrorist he fits the profile of what he actually is a domestic terrorist they could have easily dirtied this up by not showing his picture or mentioning his name to seed doubt about who obamas mystery pal might be as it is the narrator specifically refers to the weather underground as an american terrorist group beyond that though the left usually loves to point out that domestic terrorists like abortion clinic bombers are every bit as evil as the jihadist movement that so worries hysterical fearmongers like you and me which is true there arent as many of them and they dont have as many apologists but a truck bomb is a truck bomb is a truck bomb morally theyre equivalent just dont point out that equivalence when youre criticizing barack obama that turns it into a smear
8469215 was part of the weather underground in the 1970s they bombed the pentagon the capitol and other buildings hes never apologized for that
8469216 the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when i was eight years old somehow reflects on me and my values doesnt make much sense george
8469217 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8469218 this new series will be of the same caliber as the other two these writers know what they are doing they can write good television youve been with us this long stay with us for the ninth inning itll be worth it and thank you for the five years youve given us
8469219 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8469220 the cause of america is in a great measure the cause of all mankind
8469221 those men have other feelings than us who have nothing suffered
8469222 what we obtain too cheap we esteem too lightly it is dearness only that gives every thing its value
8469223 man did not enter into society to become worse than he was before nor to have fewer rights than he had before but to have those rights better secured
8469224 that whole area is just so vulnerable to an intense storm its like rolling a bowling ball down an alley if it hits its going to knock some pins down
8469225 when you start looking at the details the gulf has an impact out of proportion to the percentages because its close its cheap and its always there
8469226 if it goes into galveston texas and beaumont where the big refineries are it could be catastrophic
8469227 theres limited capacity to absorb damage and repair it quickly
8469228 we have a 64 processor beowulf cluster that does the modeling we can do differential equations and look at satellite imagery
8469229 but these longer range forecasts meh were not that smart
8469230 i think its time for bryce to open his presents blah blah blah
8469231 negotiating under fire preserving peace talks in the face of terror attacks
8469232 hamas politics charity and terrorism in the service of jihad
8469233 when it was shown to him he was very very pleased indeed
8469234 he could only widen his eyes or something like that but it was explained to him and he was thrilled
8469235 it probably did as much as the injections they were giving him
8469236 doctors dont usually make predictions but they are predicting that within three days they will be able to feed him solids and that should build up his strength
8469237 it is of the lords mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions fail not they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness
8469238 i came to work this morning which is option expiry day saying wed be up 40 points and were up 46 at the moment so im happy with that he said
8469239 i think we saw bhp and rio both up in the uk and new york so we had a little bit on our side when we made that forecast and option expiry usually steadies the market anyway
8469240 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power

8469242 a excepci n de las noticias de la noche se ha convertido en un formato generalizado el tener showgirls para seducir a la audiencia

8469244 oh yeah they are doing more its worth my money to join
8469245 we want to show fox they can make money by bringing the buffyverse back to live action and were going to show them how so this means concrete evidence of financial success and examples of buffy in the media put together in a proposal that is signed by as many buffy fans as we can get a hold of once we have a petition signed and growing interest we take this movement to the media outlets to get wider coverage
8469246 buffy fans campaign to bring the cartoon slayer to life
8469247 if i have a meeting and if i can do it via conference call or placeware a web conferencing tool theyd prefer that i do that
8469248 between april and june 2008 the college held 378 meetings which saved 54 000 in travel expenses and 408 days in time as well as 57 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions
8469249 thanks to rising gas prices skyrocketing air travel expenses and other budget crunching developments businesses are scaling back on travel
8469250 2 3 of panel organizations are responding to recent rise in energy gas prices through green telework programs and expanded or new conferencing amp collaboration technologies

8469254 there may be a bit of argy bargy on the way through but i think its time to do this
8469255 were prepared to have an argument if thats necessary you cant simply allow our kids to be in schools which are consistently underperforming
8469256 whats not smart is having underperforming schools year after year decade after decade not even measuring it not even recognising its happening and not even doing anything about it
8469257 what you should measure is if youve got like student populations and you can see one school thats rocketing up the attainment level and the other school thats falling behind then you can go into this school and say whats happening here what are the teachers doing whats the principal doing what are the parents doing thats making a difference
8469258 you can take that best practice to the school thats falling behind
8469259 the real challenge for mr rudd is will he now withhold funding from those state government and non government schools that do not comply

8469261 everything works together for good to those who love god
8469262 play allows children to create and explore a world they can master conquering their fears while practicing adult roles play helps children develop new competencies and the resiliency they will need to face future challenges
8469263 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
8469264 the value of the house thats put on there is also taken into consideration
8469265 but when you remove the opportunity for a lender to take security over land then all theyve got is the building thats going to be put on there and thats not a strong case for a lender to consider when someones asking for a mortgage
8469266 were not aware of any lender that would lend on the basis of building a home on leasehold land which is really the premise of the proposal put forward
8469267 so the question is where would the lender feel comfortable when theres really no security
8469268 he promised communities would be consulted yet heres the plan no ones been consulted
8469269 and these are fairly extensive routes for b triples b triples currently run only on between broadmeadows and geelong thats it at the moment so this is an extensive array of proposed routes for b triples
8469270 its about how we do shift our freight but we do minimise the impact on residential streets
8469271 tales of his miraculous cures from cancer aids and other terminal illnesses abound in italy thousands converge on his services to witness people reputedly possessed with demons writhing in agony on the floor while milingo conducts his mass exorcism dancing singing and shouting
8469272 as he has accused an unidentified cabal of vatican clerics of doing subjected to a trial that he said resembled the
8469273 are there men of the curia who are followers of satan
8469274 certainly there are priests and bishops i stop at this level of ecclesiastical hierarchy because i am an archbishop higher than this i cannot go
8469275 from somewhere or other the smoke of satan has entered the temple of god
8469276 i have not heard that anyone has seen him leave we must pray that he will go away
8469277 i have an obligation to carry out what the lord wants and thats what im doing
8469278 could not be considered a bishop of the catholic church
8469279 milingo has betrayed the zambian people and the catholic church if it is in the name of jesus and the glory of god he acted then it is incomprehensible that he was married by a man whose followers consider him the messiah
8469280 archbishop milingo is a good bishop and his contention that there are satanists in rome is completely correct anybody who is acquainted with the state of affairs in the vatican in the last 35 years is well aware that the prince of darkness has had and still has his surrogates in the court of st peter in rome

8469348 it is clear to everyone that water is a very scarce resource on this island the fact that the albany development will site its golf course on top of the island s largest water lens is indefensible lined or not the golf course will impact the islands largest remaining water resource golf courses require fertilizers herbicides and fungicides to keep them green and healthy despite the most stringent protocols during heavy rains run off from the golf course will pollute the freshwater lens

8469356 mccain bush republicans have been wrong again and again they cant win on the issues so they go into the gutter
8469357 you dont decide who loves this country you dont decide whos a patriot that flag doesnt belong to any ideology or party it belongs to all of us
8469358 i was a girl who wasnt allowed to take a drafting class in high school the world has changed
8469359 for me its all about legacy i wish that there were 48 hours in each day so that i had the stamina and time to expedite all of my ideas accordingly i receive credit for my accomplishments but i tend to think that im just getting started i prefer to move under the radar i stay away from negativity and never stop for anyone in my heart im a product of the culture im not fabricated or premeditated ive been through a lot if i was to ever slow down it would be purely by choice while other individuals are talking drinking smoking or focusing on women im in my own space striving towards a higher plateau we must preserve our culture as djs entertainers enthusiasts purists supporters and so forth actions speak louder than words the time is now
8469360 sacking principals turning over staff closing schools that churning and instability that will occur in that process is not going to help students and may in fact damage communities
8469361 the plans that kevin rudd has put forward simply wont make a systematic or system wide difference to education
8469362 within the worlds emerging economies millions of new businesses are demanding just the technology they need at the prices they can afford from a vendor they can trust
8469363 we have high hopes for broad adoption in the 20 countries
8469364 a good move because its not only in emerging markets where there are high growth rates but also among small and medium businesses
8469365 given dells history this represents a tactical move to build out its channels and reach out to more customers
8469366 the key thing that we did is we focused on the functionality that was required and then we didnt add features that werent going to be used
8469367 a really good way to describe this is that small and medium enterprises in emerging countries have basic needs internet access office productivity tools basic accounting those kinds of things and they have a limited budget
8469368 its just a matter of whether they can reach consumers
8469369 its very conceivable that two thirds of revenue for dell will come from outside of the united states five years from now
8469370 i want to express my anger and frustration as a man with the women i feel are miseducated misinformed and ill prepared about their responsibilities in getting and maintaining a relationship with a man of quality
8469371 heres a little secret ladies men never really ask for anything
8469372 my mother used to say walk them home from school grab their books give them gifts blah blah blah yada yada yada
8469373 i went like that for maybe two years and i probably lost every girlfriend that came along
8469374 once i started being myself and saying look im not going to do this this or that for women the phone didnt stop ringing
8469375 a search of the address in derbyshire is under way and is expected to take several days
8469376 its that kenyan mind set you help your relatives all your relatives
8469377 but i keep telling people that barack will inspire people as opposed to giving them a handout
8469378 this is something that we never dreamed could happen in our lifetimes
8469379 its scary i dont want to get my hopes up
8469380 a lot of africans dont feel worthy as if we have nothing to contribute
8469381 just goes to show people what one of us can do
8469382 as an african you feel you get a late start here but obamas dad came here as a student like us
8469383 there are all sorts of crazy things and rumors like that going around
8469384 some people over there just dont realize things here dont work like that
8469385 car makers recently held the hydrogen road tour 08 to publicize h2 powered road cars but a lack of fueling stations meant long stretches on flatbeds is the world ready for the h2 car
8469386 when you see the abuse of power youve got to speak
8469387 we not the senate were all my father cared about he decided not to take the oath of office he said delaware can get anothe rsenator but my boys cant get another father however great men like ted kennedy mike mansfield hubert humphrey men who have been tested in their own right convinced him to serve he was sworn in at my bedside
8469388 four years later we me my brother and my dad married my mom jill
8469389 some people poke fun at my dad for talking too much what some people dont know is that as a young boy he had a severe stutter the kids called him dash now he speaks with a clear and strong voice he says what needs to be said and he does what needs to be done
8469390 i have something to ask of you be there for my dad as hes been there for me
8469391 wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears
8469392 hes currently scheduled to spend a solid two hour block from 9 00 to 11 00 p m pushing lies distortions and manipulations about barack and university of illinois professor william ayers
8469393 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8469394 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves
8469395 at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8469396 i would say this is the biggest response weve ever got from a campaign or a candidate
8469397 this is really unprecedented with the show the way that people are flooding the calls and our email boxes
8469398 he got into the files just yesterday so we wanted to have him on to find out what he found and if at all possible we wanted to get the obama campaign to get their side of the story
8469399 thats why the uproar is kind of amazing because we wanted the obama campaigns take as well to kind of balance it out
8469400 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama mr clinton told the democratic national convention in denver
8469401 president obama will choice diplomacy first and military force as a last resort
8469402 people around the world have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8469403 what good is voting if all i can choose between is and a turd sandwich
8469404 no matter how much you try to link bush and mccain they are not the same
8469405 senator mccain has proposed substantial tax cuts offset only very partially by proposals to broaden the tax base
8469406 more government debt eventually translates into higher interest rates which discourage business investment and consumers demand for homes and such durable goods as automobiles or alternatively into increased debt owed to foreigners which mortgages the nations long term economic future
8469407 someone tell me based on this image alone why i shouldnt
8469408 my income dropped to below the standard deduction so now i pay no taxes thanks obama
8469409 within the top 5 only the top 1 will actually see tax increases and those tax increases will be minor
8469410 i want to pay more so my boss will be happy
8469411 your obama tax cut is you will probably not get an obama tax cut
8469412 im going to reduce the cost of your daily beer by 20
8469413 i only saved a dollar too its unfair that he got ten times more than i
8469414 why should he get 10 back when i got only two the wealthy get all the breaks
8469415 we didnt get anything at all the system exploits the poor
8469416 john mccain would tax you xxx xx more than barack obama
8469417 but if there were no wal mart where would you buy groceries you should just be thankful that they provide you with all the shopping lanes and food you will need
8469418 you tax us when were born you tax us when we die you tax us when we eat you tax us when we sleep get off our backs
8469419 my income dropped to below the standard deduction so now i pay no taxes thanks obama
8469420 pretty soon you may actually have a 50 hour minimum wage but a cup of joe will also cost you about 50
8469421 in about 6 weeks the minimum wage will go up to 50 per hour
8469422 so according to your interpretation of obama nomics we will all have to work for about an hour for a cup of joe pretty soon
8469423 happy with your obama tax cut consider donating to the obama campaign

8469427 non ho detto che non mi piacciono gli omosessuali semplicemente la devono smettere di chiedere dei diritti speciali
8469428 non ho niente contro gli omosessuali per prego per loro perch finiranno allinferno per via del loro
8469429 there may be a bit of argy bargy on the way through but i think its time to do this
8469430 were prepared to have an argument if thats necessary you cant simply allow our kids to be in schools which are consistently underperforming
8469431 whats not smart is having underperforming schools year after year decade after decade not even measuring it not even recognising its happening and not even doing anything about it
8469432 what you should measure is if youve got like student populations and you can see one school thats rocketing up the attainment level and the other school thats falling behind then you can go into this school and say whats happening here what are the teachers doing whats the principal doing what are the parents doing thats making a difference
8469433 you can take that best practice to the school thats falling behind
8469434 the real challenge for mr rudd is will he now withhold funding from those state government and non government schools that do not comply
8469435 mr rudd has the power now to withhold money from states that have not complied with this and the challenge for him is will he do so
8469436 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
8469437 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
8469438 if we win another such battle we would be completely lost
8469439 rated mr jinnah among 20th century leaders even above de gaulle
8469440 that unlike jinnah general de gaulle not only had the support of giants like roosevelt truman and churchill but he also had an army jinnah had neither and therein lay his greatness
8469441 if three years ago someone had said to me on the streets of new york that somebody named barack obama would be our nominee i would have said they were crazy
8469442 i volunteered for him for two years and most of that time i never thought he would win
8469443 this is something people like me have been waiting for for days weeks years
8469444 hes going to the white house hes going to be our next president
8469445 this is one of most significant events in american history
8469446 i think about all the suffering all the pain all the hurt of so many people
8469447 what you see happening here tonight is the down payment of the fulfillment of dream of martin luther king
8469448 just a few short years ago in georgia alabama mississippi many people of color could not even register to vote and now these people are voting for an african american
8469449 it was an amazing moment not for african americans for americans
8469450 i wanted to be on the floor not only as a democrat as an american but clearly as an african american when i was a little girl i never thought id see this day i never thought id see a viable female candidate viable minority candidate get this far
8469451 when we were kids our parents would tell us we could grow up to be anything we wanted to be we giggled because we knew certain doors were closed after this historic year those gates are now wide open so this is an exciting moment for the entire country
8469452 i was deeply moved and i think that youd have to be a curmudgeon if you dont see the historic nature of this evening gop conservative analyst amy holmes said
8469453 it is a milestone that we witnessed here tonight in our countrys ability sometimes to just say you know the past is the past
8469454 look how hard he had to fight just to win the nomination
8469455 its not just democrats that are going to vote in this election i want to think he can win but i live in the real world
8469456 its demonstrating that this party has come together and were going to be a united group
8469457 we have taken a large step toward reconstruction in this country
8469458 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
8469459 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
8469460 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
8469461 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
8469462 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
8469463 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
8469464 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
8469465 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
8469466 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
8469467 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
8469468 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
8469469 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
8469470 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
8469471 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
8469472 i was too young and too inexperience to be commander in chief he recalled
8469473 when we did the 100th harley davidson anniversary we had so much fun people have been so hospitable and so generous as soon as we open our mouths and they hear the accent they cant do enough for you
8469474 to restore americas standing to what it was eight years ago
8469475 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8469476 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8469477 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win
8469478 i want everybody to now understand why i am so proud to have joe biden and the whole biden family
8469479 i think hes presented himself pretty well so far what do you think
8469480 no longer will the eight most dreaded words in the be the vice presidents office is on the phone
8469481 i know it you know it barack obama gets it
8469482 this is the time as americans together we get back up
8469483 these are extraordinary times this is an extraordinary election are ready barack obama is ready this is his time this is our time this is americas time
8469484 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8469485 ive been on the ground in georgia iraq and i can tell you in no uncertain terms this administrations policy has been an abject failure
8469486 again and again on the most important of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8469487 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8469488 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8469489 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8469490 be there because will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8469491 joe biden is right we need more than a good soldier we need a leader with the experience and judgment to serve as commander in chief from day one that leader is
8469492 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8469493 if these things are not to be undertaken im not just talking about electricity but other reforms certainly theres no role for me in the new south wales parliament
8469494 we will set about detailing an energy plan for the people of new south wales that they can decide on at the next election
8469495 the collapse of globalism and the reinvention of the world
8469496 the time for change has come and barack obama is the change we need
8469497 for eight years george bushs national security decisions and now he offers up four more years of the same failed policies barack obama has proven that he has the judgment to deliver the change we need
8469498 make better health care and benefits for veterans a higher priority than tax cuts for exxon mobil and the had been scheduled to address the convention wednesday but his remarks were pushed to thursday after the program fell behind schedule

8469506 slow strengthening is forecast once gustav moves farther away from haiti and the storm could regain hurricane strength within the next day or two
8469507 regardless of its predicted path it is important for citizens in the gulf coast region to listen to what their local officials are advising over the course of the next few days and to take these simple steps to prepare

8469511 what do we sing about when we sing about the body the chart based on a sample of thousands of songs tells the story the size of the circle corresponds to how often that part is mentioned in a particular genre
8469512 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by making love but one day all of a sudden it just happened i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him just nothing but it was just the best way to go

8469515 wow i wish i was kays husband first she kills him with her vagina and then she shows his penis to paramedics yeah thats how i wanna go too
8469516 when youth are engaged in the political process they take a greater ownership of their community
8469517 by getting young people involved in politics we stand a better chance of keeping them here and benefitting from their talents some estimates put the number of young people who voted in this years primary as more than double 2004
8469518 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8469519 rebuild the american dream and restore americas standing in the world
8469520 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8469521 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
8469522 the campaign generated so much heat it increased global warming
8469523 he has shown a clear grasp of our foreign policy and national security challenges
8469524 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 and it will not work in 2008
8469525 to testify that barack obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary
8469526 after weeks of moaning and groaning about how angry he is about how mad he is at obama he made the strongest case for obama of anyone at this convention
8469527 he thinks he did a great job he wants to get his due from the guy whos succeeding him
8469528 reminded us of what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8469529 he jesus did so as a dependent limited human being trusting in my life and power to be at work within him and through him jesus as a human being had no power within himself to heal anyone
8469530 only as he jesus rested in his relationship with me and in our communion our co union could he express my heart and will into any given circumstance
8469531 to begin with that you cant grasp the wonder of my nature is rather a good thing who wants to worship a god who can be fully comprehended eh not much mystery in that

8469539 the us is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in the dprk democratic peoples republic of korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq
8469540 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities
8469541 the united states will not take north korea off the state sponsor of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for koreas nuclear program
8469542 it certainly is in violation of its commitments to the six party framework certainly in violation of the principle of action for action
8469543 this sudden move was not entirely unexpectable as the us has irked north korea by delaying the removal of north korea from the list of terrorism sponsoring states and south korea and the us did the joint military drill which was seen as a threat to the north
8469544 i do not believe that north korea whole heartedly said they will go back to the starting point in terms of denuclearization process i see it as another card at the negotiation table to urge the us to remove it from the terrorism blacklist as soon as possible
8469545 it was a u s proposal for the date which is 2015 and an iraqi one which is 2010 then we agreed to make it 2011
8469546 iraq has the right if necessary to extend the presence of these troops
8469547 as weve said negotiations are ongoing and we are not going to get into the details until an agreement is concluded
8469548 volumes will remain thin and investors are likely to stay on the sidelines till a clearer picture emerges on the political front

8469551 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8469552 the union uses the tactic of saying immigration was coming and the members of the union would not be taken
8469553 i need a job and got kids i heard that they need some help now
8469554 all them mexicans got fired because they didnt have a pass all these businesses have been taking americans jobs
8469555 that doesnt justify but it certainly explains why they might be hiring individuals who show up and say ill work for you
8469556 these vendors will increasingly be considered for strategic service deals and will augment or in some cases replace todays acknowledged megavendors in this space
8469557 such a shift in the it service landscape is a key trend that application development and sourcing managers need to understand and prepare for investment bank ubs has named infosys and smaller firm satyam as its best bets in the sector

8469560 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8469561 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8469562 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8469563 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8469564 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8469565 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8469566 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8469567 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8469568 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8469569 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8469570 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8469571 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8469572 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8469573 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls

8469635 all of these girls just love you and now youre going to be spending summer break with them you should be over the moon because lets face it youre not exactly some teen idol
8469636 all of uh all of them are so crazy about you your calendars hardly got a day open am i right
8469637 of course it is you barely have time to eat youre so beloved
8469638 you pretend like youre being all noble by not shall we say pursuing any of us but i know that its all just a lie
8469639 why pursue one when you could say no to all and have them all desperate to prove themselves to you
8469640 and you wont change my mind in a million years
8469641 ill rip out your spine if you ever say something stupid like that again
8469642 hey if you werent here things would be a lot more difficult
8469643 im just being a good person is all why should i not try to help you just because you clean toilets
8469644 on august 19 2008 the business provided the following information contact name and title desiree front desk man contact phone xxx xxx xxxx contact email desireexxxxx himuskegon xxxxxxxx com im not sure what happened here but a response was sent back the day that i received it i will go ahead and explain the situation again mr harlow had spoken to rachel she was a gsr but is no longer with us initially about his reservation our system is very clear on what our rate is for each room and it will even add on our taxes for us so we can have the total amount upon booking i had spoken to rachel about this situation and she was very clear with me on what she had quoted mr harlow she said that she was on the phone with him for quiet some time explaining all the details to mr harlow when his wife came to check in there was all this confusion with her on the price i wrote down everything for her seperate room prices taxes all of that and none of that seemed right to her i then spoke to mr harlow and explained the same thing to him he was giving me information that was not even registered in my computer i 100 percent believe that this was a misunderstanding on mr harlows behalf rachel was very clear on what she quoted him and strongly said that she had quoted the direct pricing to him i tried very hard to work with mr harlow on this but after the second time speaking to him he was very rude and was threatning action against our hotel and then hung up on me i stronngly disagree with any sort of compensation for mr harlow we already gave him a discount and feel like this was plenty of compensation for him thank you
8469645 our system is very clear on what our rate is for each room and it will even add on our taxes for us so we can have the total amount upon booking
8469646 i had spoken to rachel about this situation and she was very clear with me on what she had quoted mr harlow she said that she was on the phone with him for quiet some time explaining all the details to mr harlow
8469647 really 339 a minute ago you told me the bedroom was 129 a night and now you are offering me the suite for 339 for the entire weekend
8469648 when his wife came to check in there was all this confusion with her on the price i wrote down everything for her separate room prices taxes all of that and none of that seemed right to her
8469649 i then spoke to mr harlow and explained the same thing to him he was giving me information that was not even registered in my computer i 100 percent believe that this was a misunderstanding on mr harlows behalf
8469650 rachel was very clear on what she quoted him and strongly said that she had quoted the direct pricing to him
8469651 i tried very hard to work with mr harlow on this but after the second time speaking to him he was very rude and was threatening action against our hotel and then hung up on me
8469652 i did not call to argue with you about this i will just dispute the charges with my credit card company
8469653 i strongly disagree with any sort of compensation for mr harlow we already gave him a discount and feel like this was plenty of compensation for him

8469659 finally a guy who can hang with me hes confident and treats me like a real person and hes the only guy whos actually tried to talk to me today instead of whistling from his car
8469660 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8469661 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8469662 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8469663 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8469664 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8469665 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8469666 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8469667 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8469668 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8469669 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8469670 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8469671 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8469672 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8469673 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8469674 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8469675 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8469676 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8469677 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8469678 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8469679 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity

8469682 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8469683 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8469684 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8469685 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8469686 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them

8469691 the labor members of a senate committee have decided to rush out a report which endorses labor policy
8469692 the reality is that fuelwatch will not only not put the price of petrol down it will actually increase it
8469693 fuelwatch is nothing more than foolwatch and those labor mps that have decided to endorse it are doing nothing more than following mr rudd
8469694 its a rather unusual step that a senate committee would put out an interim report the purpose of which is to do nothing more than to deceive the independent senators
8469695 fuelwatch is sham it has the potential to push up the price of fuel for motorists its nothing more than a quick fix for kevin rudd the committee has failed to justify its position
8469696 the analysis by the accc has been criticised the committee travelled the width and breadth of the country and struggled to find anyone who would support this hare brained scheme
8469697 certainly the accs work is certainly subject to some considerable question
8469698 fuelwatch is working against independent petrol retailers in western australia in fact many have closed down since the introduction
8469699 there were 200 independent petrol retailers before fuelwatch there are now 17
8469700 the mums and dads who run grocery stores across australia are having to fight against a taxpayer funded advertising campaign for coles and woollies

8469702 as kids most scanners had been having a great time at school no one objected to their many interests because every hour of every students school day is devoted to a different subject but at some point in high school or soon after everyone was expected to make a choice and thats when scanners ran into trouble while some people happily narrowed down to one subject scanners simply couldnt the conventional wisdom was overwhelming and seemed indisputable if youre a jack of all trades youll always be a master of none youll become a dilettante a dabbler a superficial person and youll never have a decent career suddenly a scanner who all through school might have been seen as an enthusiastic learner had now become a failure

8469708 yall wrong for posting leaks of any artists material so close to the release its becoming bad for hip hop it lends to the idea that all hip hop can be criticized for the things through which it was created

8469714 the change in the al anbar province is real and perceptible
8469715 anbar remains a dangerous place but the ever growing ability of the iraqi security forces continues to move us closer to seeing iraqi control of the province
8469716 the force we needed in the anbar province in 2005 2006 to fight the insurgent at its height is not the force that we need there now to do nation building and to try to bring the government and the sunnis closer together
8469717 are doing a very good job of this nation building business
8469718 its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going someplace else in a much more expeditionary environment where the marine air ground task force really seems to have a true and enduring value then thats where we need to be
8469719 the taliban are growing bolder in their tactics and clearly doing their best to exploit security gaps where they exist
8469720 everyone seems to agree that additional forces are the ideal course of action for preventing a taliban comeback but just where theyre going to come from is still up for discussion
8469721 should our leadership determine that more u s forces are needed in the fight in afghanistan its no secret that the marine corps would be proud to be part of that undertaking
8469722 however in order to do more in afghanistan our marines have got to see relief elsewhere
8469723 lets review the facts white house analysts congressional analysts and the oil industry all agree that offshore drilling wont add one drop to our energy pool in 10 years

8469745 there may be current efforts under way to close down railhead completely
8469746 the end result is a current system used to identify terrorist threats that has been crippled by technical flaws and a new system that if actually deployed will leave our country more vulnerable than the existing yet flawed system in operation today

8469751 i can have any man i want including your boyfriend
8469752 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8469753 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8469754 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8469755 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8469756 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8469757 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8469758 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8469759 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8469760 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8469761 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8469762 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8469763 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8469764 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8469765 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8469766 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8469767 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8469768 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8469769 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8469770 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8469771 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8469772 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8469773 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8469774 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8469775 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8469776 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8469777 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8469778 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8469779 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8469780 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8469781 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8469782 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8469783 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8469784 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8469785 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8469786 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8469787 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8469788 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8469789 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8469790 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8469791 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8469792 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8469793 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8469794 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8469795 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8469796 and him pointing beyond his bedroom door to further emphasize his new word holy
8469797 is his favorite whether its an airplane car bus oh yes he loves him some school bus or lawnmower we have not encouraged this its just a boy thing hes picked up
8469798 the coalition will oppose the rudd labor governments punitive 30 per cent increase in the so called luxury car tax
8469799 it is the politics of envy which will increase inflation

8469832 there may be current efforts under way to close down railhead completely
8469833 the end result is a current system used to identify terrorist threats that has been crippled by technical flaws and a new system that if actually deployed will leave our country more vulnerable than the existing yet flawed system in operation today

8469875 europes relationship with russia has seldom been more difficult than today but this issue cannot wait for a political solution to the conflict addressing this situation should be a top priority for the eu at next weeks summit
8469876 russia is obligated to ensure the safety and well being of civilians in the areas under its de facto control but civilians are clearly not being protected
8469877 this is why the european union should urgently agree on an international presence to ensure security
8469878 i stood in the street with three neighbors they approached us shooting in the air and said you werent happy with a peaceful life now were going to show you they asked for money but what kind of money do we have then they started beating us with the butts of their guns one neighbor had his collar bone broken as a result of the beating he was taken to the hospital they hit me and another neighbor in the face on the ribs and in the kidney area then they went to the next door house and looted it i saw them take away a fridge clothes and other things they loaded the loot on to a cart and forced me at gunpoint to push it

8469918 typically smaller businesses dont have anyone in house who can help with it problems and they basically look for someone to do that work for them and take care of the problem
8469919 these days most small and medium size business are pretty much reliant on computers and in my experience visiting these business you find a lot of things could be done a lot better

8469929 lets say the human cell is a house and insulin is the key to the house without chromium which is the person using the key the door cannot be opened and glucose cannot enter the cell

8469951 e rimasto lo stesso uomo di cui mi innamorai 19 anni fa luomo che quando mi ha portato a casa dallospedale insieme alla nostra prima figlia guidava a passo di lumaca guardando con ansia nello specchietto retrovisore sentendo per intero il peso del nostro futuro nelle sue mani e deciso a dare alla nostra bimba tutto ci per cui aveva lottato e quello che lui non aveva mai avuto labbraccio rassicurante di un padre

8469954 et kulturhistorisk aspekt og en historiefortelling som b r bevares for ettertida
8469955 on numerous occasions ive represented independent directors and audit committees
8469956 i dont believe this is only a trend which is triggered by a crisis but instead reflects the complexity and demands being placed on directors today and the recognition of the fact that board members need additional advice in order to fulfill their very demanding fiduciary obligations
8469957 when directors reach out and say they want independent counsel to assist them its from their desire to do the best job possible
8469958 the case for independent counsel board members increasingly recognize the wisdom of seeking separate legal advice
8469959 since passage of the sarbanes oxley act two clear trends have emerged in corporate governance
8469960 first most directors and ceos have come to recognize the value of an independent board the second trend directors operating in an increasingly regulated and litigious environment are seeking legal advice more frequently as a regular feature of board diligence
8469961 most directors now recognize the significant intersection of those two trends since your company benefits from having independent directors and sound legal advice you should ensure that directors are getting independent legal advice
8469962 looking at it through the eyes of the general counsel i have found that the stronger the general counsel is the more they view this as an opportunity and not a problem
8469963 general counsel have a very difficult and time consuming job they recognize a board may have a different point of view than management this is a very thoughtful way for a general counsel to work with somebody who is looking at it through a different lens
8469964 were going to keep our commitments to afghanistan and iraq as we have pledged to do
8469965 for the sake of our freedom and security we must not relent until this enemy is destroyed
8469966 were gathering better intelligence because now the iraqis are less afraid to pass along tips about where enemy fighters are hiding and where they keep their weapons
8469967 is substantially degraded running out of sanctuaries losing the fight
8469968 has given iraqs elected leaders the breathing room to pass new reforms and theyve stepped up to their responsibilities
8469969 are able to lead more and more operations on their own
8469970 weve brought home all five of the combat brigades and the three marine units who were sent into iraq as part of the surge
8469971 further troop movements will as always depend on what is happening on the ground
8469972 ive had no greater privilege than the chance to work with members of the american armed forces
8469973 i believe that if anyone lacks for inspiration in the war on terror they need look no farther than the men and women who do the fighting
8469974 whether its on cold mountain peaks in afghanistan or the hot dusty streets of iraq they have been magnificent
8469975 and a new generation of warriors is the next chapter of american ingenuity bravery and valor
8469976 we have served those principles and sacrificed for them to the far corners of the earth
8469977 we have thrown back tyrants stood watch on the frontiers of freedom and defended the weak against the violent
8469978 weve done all this not for glory or empire but for freedom because we know that the spread of freedom makes our world safer and brings us closer to the peace we all desire
8469979 in the process weve received more than our share of criticism and we can take it
8469980 is a better place because of the power the influence and the values of the united states of america
8469981 blessed with the finest military any nation has ever fielded
8469982 and may we never take them or their families for granted
8469983 but like any organization in order to make it work youve got to get involved you go to national conventions and you have the cost of going there and time out of your practice
8469984 the amount of money weve spent has been far exceeded in the amount of business weve been able to generate
8469985 i wouldnt be doing it if i didnt think it was a wise investment on the part of my firm
8469986 we go to big companies and say why pay the big prices
8469987 clients are just as anxious to find good lawyers as lawyers are to find good clients
8469988 the only way we saw possible to do that was by joining up with an affiliation of firms
8469989 it was of concern to him because he has clients in different jurisdictions
8469990 its extremely helpful to have another plaintiff attorney say yes ive used this expert witness and yes the expert is good
8469991 when we have cases in the office that we think would be of interest to the public we can add our stories to the newsletter
8469992 determining whether a particular search methodology such as keywords will or will not be effective certainly requires knowledge beyond the ken of a lay person and a lay lawyer and requires expert testimony that meets the requirements of rule 702 of the federal rules of evidence
8469993 was not intended to defend the right to publish and display pornography or to be gratuitously ignorant or to burn flags or to market decapitation videos
8469994 the noble and democratic judeo christian tradition of speech freedom was intended to provide a realm of liberty for the debating of ideas it was to provide a realm of peace and liberty in which people who held differing views could debate them verbally and rationally instead of trying to chop their enemies heads off or slipping poison into their goblet
8469995 the human rights brigade has made it quite clear that freedom of the press and artistic licence are non issues when someone claims hurt feelings its dangerously naive to think they wouldnt trample academic freedom
8469996 an american has rights guaranteed to him under the u s constitution even while abroad but a canadian is a kind of prisoner who must submit to after the fact censorship by the thought police of the canadian state the chinese were able to give similar assurances over the olympics that in effect we wont censor the new york times but what we do to our tibetans and falun gong and christians is strictly an internal matter this
