5750010 tennis home during the us open has now grown beyond queens to be featured prominently in the heart of new york city
5750011 us open soho will provide more tennis to more people in new york city than ever before
5750012 the pop up stores always work well where theres big big crowds and soho has the largest crowds on the weekend of any area in manhattan
5750013 give a jolt to a space that normally stays vacant
5750014 we dont always succeed but its about taking risks and pushing ourselves as educators
5750015 younger children seem more interested in setting short term goals for their learning in the game compared to older children who are more interested in simply playing and the actions of playing
5750016 thus younger children may show a greater need for focusing on small aspects of a given problem than older children even in a leisure based situation such as playing video games
5750017 the big picture is that there are several dimensions on which games have effects including the amount they are played the content of each game what you have to pay attention to on the screen and how you control the motions
5750018 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
5750019 i think his career has shown that when you go every day there are more valleys but depending on how the lineups fall hes certainly in consideration for a second base slot
5750020 its the point in the season where youre going bad and youre falling out of it
5750021 youve really got to bear down and take some pride we had a couple games this homestand that were pretty embarrassing
5750022 we just feel very confident when he takes the mound
5750023 hes throwing strikes velocity is good hes mixing his pitches hes just having a tremendous second half
5750024 i like jo jo but dang there comes a time when youve got to be in charge on the mound
5750025 not at all those guys have put up numbers before
5750026 whether quentin has done it in the minor leagues and alexei has done it in cuba these guys are capable of being great ballplayers and they are doing a heck of a job for us this year
5750027 our pitching was going good for quite a while and we were struggling with the bats
5750028 now it seems like were getting 12 or 15 hits a night and the pitching is starting to struggle or has been struggling for a little while
5750029 his ankle is still a little tender but at that point of the game we took him out not because of the ankle
5750030 i didnt really have good stuff i had to throw a lot of pitches
5750031 the position were in winning series is what were shooting for
5750032 i dont care who youre playing or how many people are in the stands im just glad that our young players are playing hard
5750033 thats part of my job driving in runs and youve got to have guys on base to do that
5750034 its a testament to those guys im just trying to be a complement to the puzzle
5750035 youre not going to win them all but obviously thats one of the better teams in the american league east and the american league for that matter
5750036 well just have to pick up the pieces and claw our way through this
5750037 it would be the biggest mistake of his life if he goes on the mound hoping to show the rangers something
5750038 i started to feel it right before the all star game
5750039 but thank god my arm is ok its just my neck
5750040 if the storm continues its current track and the road conditions are safe we will play the game
5750041 i think everybody in here will do everything possible to make sure it doesnt happen again its not in joes hands any more its in nobodys hands but ours
5750042 it bothers me we dont need to be talking about this stuff
5750043 we feel pretty good with ourselves were not going to quit and we got back into it
5750044 with our ballclub you feel like youre going to find a way to get a big hit and tie the ballgame we just couldnt come up with one
5750045 we need to get back to playing how we played the first month and start scoring some runs it was nice to get out early tonight
5750046 ten days is a long time and i had a couple days where i wasnt doing anything so today was just about knocking the rust off
5750047 he was walking around trying to stay loose but pitching coach rick anderson and i looked at him and told him no chance
5750048 it was stiff and tight and it was getting tight after that last swing
5750049 ill see how he feels tuesday but this is something i am not really interested in playing around with i am not going to go out here and go through this every night
5750050 this team will hit because weve all done it before
5750051 but until we pick it up well have to make sure we are at least getting the clutch hits
5750052 theyre trying you just got to keep on being positive with them bring them back to where they were before
5750053 i dont want to lose obviously its not easy but the effort its there guys want to catch the ball they want to hit the ball they want to throw strikes theyre just not doing it right now
5750054 we have our backs up against the wall and every game is very important
5750055 we all know how good their pitching staff is and how theyve been playing us so its going to be a challenge
5750056 but you certainly have to come back the next day and continue to do that
5750057 he got off to a rough start similar to what weve seen the last couple of games
5750058 but he seemed to find his command in the third and at least got us through the game long enough to where we didnt have to go too deep into the bullpen
5750059 there are going to be balls where you square up that are going to be outs and then you are going to get some breaks and sometimes it doesnt
5750060 right now i feel as good physically as i have all year
5750061 im in a good spot where i can go out there and make my pitches every time
5750062 i could throw it for strikes on both sides of the plate
5750063 he had much more life on the ball and was down in the zone much better
5750064 were certainly in a good place right now with a lot of confidence
5750065 its our only choice to try to come to the field and win
5750066 everybody goes through it well go out on the road and try to turn this thing around
5750067 we had a tough series in houston and to come in here and win three of four was pretty good
5750068 the supervised injection site undercuts the ethic of medical practice and sets a debilitating example for all physicians and nurses both present and future in canada
5750069 this is a profound moral issue and when canadians are fully informed of it i believe they will reject it on principle
5750070 junkies and pushers dont belong near children and families they should be in rehab or behind bars
5750071 there is growing evidence that harm reduction efforts can have a positive effect on the poor health outcomes associated with drug use
5750072 is it true that supervised injections offer positive health outcomes i would not put it this way insite vancouvers safe injection site may slow the death spiral of a deadly drug habit but it does not reverse it i do not regard this as a positive health outcome
5750073 minister is off base in calling into question the ethics of physicians
5750074 we have an opinion based on scientific evidence the minister has come to a different conclusion
5750075 ive never seen such an offensive performance by a health minister
5750076 how dare he come to a meeting of professionals and scold them about their perceived ethical failings
5750077 last week the governments four week moving average of first time claims for unemployment increased to its highest level since april 2002
5750078 this suggests that job market conditions are likely to continue to deteriorate in the months ahead employers are unlikely to build their employee workforces given the slowing economy the end of the tax rebates and all of the factors potentially affecting consumer spending in a negative way including energy prices housing and the consumer credit crunch as a result employed americans worries about their personal job situations may tend to increase as the remainder of this year unfolds
5750079 on the other hand the sharp drop in oil and gas prices over the past 30 days has had a positive impact on consumer confidence
5750080 as a result the real question for the economy looking ahead including the all important christmas shopping season seems to be whether declining gas prices even though they remain far above year ago levels will be enough not only to offset further deterioration in the jobs market but also to increase consumers real disposable incomes enough to significantly stimulate consumer spending at this point it appears the downward momentum in the jobs market may be hard to reverse in time for the christmas holidays
5750081 i am resigning from the office of the president for the sake of the country and its people
5750082 the biggest hurdle in the way of democracy has been removed the dreams of my mother shaheed benazir bhutto have come true
5750083 i am sending my resignation to the speaker national assembly as i am stepping down after consulting my legal advisers and close political supporters
5750084 this is not a time to show bravado but to get serious as the countrys dignity is at stake
5750085 no charge sheet can stand against me not even a single charge can be proven against me as i have full trust in allah almighty and i did everything with the belief of pakistan first
5750086 impeachment is their right and to face it is my right
5750087 we held elections twice the senate national assembly and local governments all completed their terms this is the essence of democracy
5750088 i publicly announced support to the government and offered to share all my experience with them to help address the complex issues it was confronting however the coalition considered me the problem and not the solution
5750089 the honour and dignity of the country will be affected and in my view the honour of the office of president will also be affected
5750090 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5750091 i leave my future in the hands of the people
5750092 to err is human i hope that people will ignore my shortcomings if any
5750093 certain vested interests began an atmosphere of confrontation and of vendetta they blamed me of hatching conspiracies from the aiwan e sadr
5750094 had it been a conspiracy we would not have done it
5750095 whosoever says that our policies for the last nine years were faulty and unsatisfactory should not damage pakistan
5750096 forget about the past and focus on the future the government should find solutions to the problems and take the country forward
5750097 the new york police department violated core constitutional rights when it arrested a group of peaceful demonstrators who were lawfully protesting against the commencement of the iraq war and those who stood to profit from it
5750098 we are gratified by the citys decision to compensate these individuals whose targeted arrests were without probable cause and intended to quell future protest in new york city this lawsuit and this settlement vindicates our clients rights to assemble and speak their mind free from the fear that they will be punished for their views
5750099 my question is why did the nypd send over 100 police in riot gear along with vehicles to block the street and disrupt the flow of morning rush hour traffic all to stop a legal peaceful protest when there are far more important matters they could be pursuing and why did they fight us in court so doggedly when they knew the evidence proved that we were arrested without any police orders to leave
5750100 we hope our victory helps convince the city to stop violating peoples rights as a matter of policy and stop wasting taxpayers money doing so
5750101 it should also serve as a reminder that washingtons illegal war in afghanistan and iraq is also being fought at home against its own citizens and in the name of war profiteers like carlyle and halliburton we intend to continue our resistance until this stops
5750102 as mark twain once said when one has tasted watermelon he knows what the angels eat i encourage my colleagues to join me in acknowledging the wisdom of mark twain by supporting this resolution
5750103 we also recognize that we have more to do and we will do so both in the remaining weeks of this years congress and next year when we will have expanded democratic majorities in the house and the senate working with president barack obama
5750104 the democrats in charge of this congress have been heavy on fluff and light on substance
5750105 resolutions are fine but why arent we also passing legislation to lower gas prices what about health care reform and runaway entitlement spending
5750106 not only do you create heat stroke awareness month every year after that you recognize the importance of heat stroke awareness month you never move on to substantive legislation

5750159 the ghanaian parliament has finally approved vodafones takeover of 70 of ghana telecom paving the way for the mobile giants first foray into west africa remarkably the approval after spirited but unsuccessful opposition by some members of the ghanaian parliament finally draws the curtain on the era of arun sarin as ceo vodafone is to pay 900 million for the stake and has pledged to invest a further 500 million in network infrastructure in the country in return the global mobile giant gets ghanas incumbent fixed line telco and the countrys third largest mobile operator onetouch
5750160 for vodafone the deal is a major turning point in recent times the company has seemingly set its sights on the big global markets where a combination of high growth and a sizeable addressable market can guarantee good returns it has recently waded into turkey china and india and ghana hardly matches the same profile
5750161 but therein lies the point as the pool of high quality acquisition targets lessens vodafone is using the ghana deal to set out its vision for the future and its readiness to compete on the african turf indeed the deal has effectively ended any speculation of a pact between vodafone and vodacom on expansion in sub saharan africa by entering ghana vodafone has taken its first steps into west africa signalling to france telecom that there is competition at hand
5750162 apart from the geographical significance the deal effectively plunges vodafone into africas fixed telecoms market for a company that until recently has traditionally regarded itself as a mobile only player running a fixed network in africa is not going to be an easy proposition with the likes of mtn and zain reluctant to wade into fixed services on the continent france telecom had seemed to be the only multinational telco prepared to buy into africas fixed telecoms turf vodafone has now followed suit and by buying an incumbent it will have to grapple with poor fixed infrastructure and political innuendos
5750163 in the light of these undertakings vodafone must be commended for its boldness in pushing ahead with the deal ghana is the ideal test bed for a push into sub saharan africa the country is english speaking relatively stable and growing steadily vodafone can thus leverage its global expertise and deep pockets to drive growth in the market
5750164 interestingly too vodafone has been fairly generous with its offer although we initially commented on the companys hastiness in announcing the deal before placating ghanaian parliamentarians quite why the deal is bad for ghana as adduced by opponents is not clear vodafones offer values the company at 1 3 billion for that price it gets to control ghana telecoms 1 4 million mobile customers about 17 market share 380 000 fixed line customers and 15 000 broadband clients vodafone also said it will take over the ghanaian governments fibre networks in comparison nigerias nitel which operates in a much bigger market was valued at 1 5 billion when it was sold to a local conglomerate in july 2006
5750165 with the ghana deal done vodafone will certainly shift its focus onto new targets already the mobile giant is reportedly in talks about upping its stake in polands polkomtel and resolving the impasse with its co shareholders beyond that new opportunities will continue to beckon and the new ceo vittorio colao will soon need to convince the companys shareholders about the viability of a new acquisition
5750166 a very powerful flashlight directed at the moon would theoretically create a bright spot on its surface by simply turning the flashlight sideways the flashlights beam streaks across the sky at speeds far exceeding the speed of light this evidence has long been known and dismissed since the bright spot cannot be used for superluminal or faster than light communication between the earth and the moon the fast motion of the bright spot is simply a geometrical artifact similar in some ways to the point at which the two blades of closing scissors intersect the theory of relativity does not concern such purely geometrical objects

5750210 these results confirm that the diy market received a reprieve from some combination of better weather fiscal stimulus and a floor in demand
5750211 awful crappy i wish i had never married i thought the sex would be better i thought there would be sex i had no idea that men had that problem for some reason i thought it would be bigger are you not supposed to be able to feel it
5750212 the continued celebration of the week is something of a totem for old cold warriors who believe that the victories of 1989 91 are still sadly unconsummated
5750213 the evils of soviet communism and nazi fascism were defeated and freedom spread around the world as new democracies emerged
5750214 voice the joy over the liberation of these people from the bourgeois fascist boot
5750215 it is absolutely clear that when the captive nations week was first initiated in 1959 the united states congress followed the logic of the bi polar confrontation when both superpowers with all their might tried to weaken each other using all possible means that often contradicted the international law however since then the fundamental changes took place in the world the end of the global fight for dominance brought the u s russia relations to the new level of cooperation the captive nations resolution lost its meaning
5750216 and even where democratic processes were encouraged from outside and at first sight seemed to work perfectly they turned out to be quite unstable and ephemeral so it is in the former soviet republic of georgia its rose revolution turned into an aggressive nationalistic regime that fiercely oppresses opposition in ukraine the orange revolution resulted in an endless struggle for power between different political forces that heavily rely on populism which led to high inflation rates and greatly undermined countrys economic capabilities the same can be seen in kyrgyzstan as the tulip revolution brought the country which provides assistance to the international coalition to combat terrorism into a deep political crisis
5750217 we dodged a bullet with the storm so thats leading to some selling
5750218 if this storm had happened a couple of weeks ago it would have driven prices higher the momentum of this market is definitely on the downside as people realize that demand is very soft
5750219 especially since there is a clear lack of buying momentum

5750224 receiving the body and blood of christ unworthily is a sacrilege
5750225 if it is done deliberately in mortal sin it is a sacrilege
5750226 public officials who with knowledge and consent uphold actions that are against the divine and eternal moral law for example if they support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives a person who commits sin in this way should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
5750227 the numbers only point in one direction higher fed interest rates the problem is the timing those numbers are kind of impotent and so is the fed
5750228 the economys simply not in a position where the fed can raise rates
5750229 so you try to make sure they know that youre intelligent and not horrible then you try to be rugged and sexy but only after smart and lovable
5750230 id love to have that blind confidence that total oblivion to how the world sees you
5750231 this morning a la honda resident reported a suspicious person in the highway 35 84 area near alices restaurant
5750232 it took a little while to get the plans out and just how we were going to do this
5750233 a year ago we didnt even have the equipment to move to the units
5750234 in the end he also became the man who couldnt deliver bush was very slow to realize that he either had been had by musharraf or that musharraf was not up to the task historians will debate this for years
5750235 the new pakistani general hes just been elected not elected this guy took over office
5750236 it wasnt a personal relationship but musharraf tried to play it effectively for domestic advantage
5750237 we pretty much played the musharraf card ad nauseam eventually to pakistans detriment
5750238 so far ive found him to be a man of his word
5750239 the fundamental question i have for president musharraf is will these elections be under emergency rule or law because if they are its going to be hard for well itll be hard for those of us who have belief that hes advanced pakistans democracy to say thats thats still the case
5750240 president bush and vice president cheney backed a discredited dictator which has undercut our ability to work with the new government to eliminate the terrorist sanctuary that has re emerged in pakistans tribal areas
5750241 president musharraf took his country a long way in turning it back from the extremism that was starting to characterize it at the time of sept 11 2001 he also kept his promise to try and help a transition to free and fair elections we didnt agree with everything he did especially the state of emergency but he did take off the military uniform the elections were free and fair
5750242 if we dont get an unexpected shock that pushes commodity prices back up this might be the worst inflation news that well get for a while
5750243 it is certainly above expectations here but i think weve probably seen for the near term anyway the worst of the inflation readings
5750244 on voyait des rochers de plus dun m tre de diam tre emport s par le courant et des arbres entiers
5750245 we have a very strong investigative team and very determined to finally put this case to end although it may not be as soon as we would have thought
5750246 if you can put this into perspective thats 80 more people that are alive compared to the same time last year so this isnt some little fluctuation
5750247 its a very small tear and its clinically not bad
5750248 its high up on his hamstring where the muscle meets the tendon and its a blow to us
5750249 this is a really shocking story its very sad actually im sure theres a lot more to it than were hearing because these kind of random acts of violence are very rare in owen sound
5750250 the racial statement is in the action of beating this guy
5750251 what are you going to do to close this quarter
5750252 he was an ordinary american who served his country in war and when he returned served his community and country for the rest of his life
5750253 i know of no one who did so much so often and so well
5750254 im proud as punch i was able to do my part
5750255 im not a hero the heroes are the guys buried beneath the crosses in france and elsewhere
5750256 not only did they save the country but after the war they came back and built the country

5750261 ravis work embodies the synthesis of fields and types of multidisciplinary research that will be necessary if chemical engineering is to make major contributions to the fields of nanotechnology and biotechnology
5750262 i cannot think of a more deserving candidate for this award
5750263 ravi is clearly at the very top of the group of dynamic young people in our profession
5750264 interfacing bioactive molecules with nanomaterials or nanoscale scaffolds is a promising approach for designing potent therapeutics and functional nanocomposites
5750265 new advances are coming faster than ever its an exciting time to be conducting research in this area
5750266 what has been achieved here puts everything else in the shade
5750267 i wanted to build something that would last and to do that you have to go slowly
5750268 no longer can we be accused of being the millionaires of the regional league we can instead take on the role as the sympathetic village team
5750269 we havent been going flat out in competitions until now weve been trying to keep out of the limelight
5750270 our strategy was to launch the initial attack and then defend ourselves against attacks from other teams
5750271 i didnt think about three gold medals even today i just thought about the sprint itself
5750272 they came and said they didnt want to have any favoritism it was the fairest way to do it
5750273 watching all week on television back in the olympic village has been very emotional for me
5750274 i was an absolute mess just because i so wanted to do it too
5750275 so many people have been worried and caring about me
5750276 i feel sorry i could do nothing but pull out of the race
5750277 i didnt feel right when i was warming up before the race i knew my foot would fail me i felt painful when i was just jogging
5750278 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5750279 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5750280 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5750281 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5750282 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5750283 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5750284 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5750285 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5750286 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5750287 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5750288 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5750289 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5750290 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5750291 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5750292 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5750293 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5750294 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5750295 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5750296 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5750297 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5750298 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5750299 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5750300 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5750301 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5750302 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5750303 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5750304 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5750305 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5750306 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5750307 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5750308 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5750309 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5750310 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5750311 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5750312 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5750313 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5750314 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5750315 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5750316 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5750317 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5750318 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5750319 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5750320 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5750321 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5750322 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5750323 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5750324 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5750325 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5750326 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5750327 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5750328 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5750329 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5750330 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5750331 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5750332 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5750333 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5750334 i just reviewed this dog of a manuscript for the journal of
5750335 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5750336 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5750337 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5750338 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5750339 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5750340 being ignorant is not so much a shame as being unwilling to learn
5750341 blogging is not easy you may experience unexpected droughts of inspiration difficultly maintaining a schedule or succumb to the pressures of always needing fresh content
5750342 as any expert on web publishing will tell you the single most important thing you have to do to build a new blog is to post regular content
5750343 what i was told was that 90 of the disconnects are initiated inside the phone which would exonerate at amp t most of the disconnects are being generated by crashes in the driver code for the 3g chip which comes from the chip vendor not something apple written and outside of apples direct control
5750344 wow once society got fed up with a dependence on oil we got off that drug a lot faster than anyone predicted
5750345 this was a major group of terrorists in suicide bomber form an attack on the coalition forces base and it was a major operation of the afghan national army commandos who succeeded in eliminating 10 suicide bombers before they could do anything
5750346 in its fight against terrorism france has been dealt a harsh blow
5750347 my determination is intact france is resolved to pursue the struggle against terrorism for democracy and freedom
5750348 the initial patrol was reinforced with quick reaction forces close air support and mobile medical teams
5750349 during the engagement a large number of insurgents were killed
5750350 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5750351 this is a planning took where all things are going
5750352 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5750353 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items

5750355 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5750356 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5750357 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5750358 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5750359 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5750360 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5750361 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5750362 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5750363 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5750364 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5750365 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5750366 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5750367 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5750368 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5750369 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5750370 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5750371 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5750372 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5750373 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5750374 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5750375 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5750376 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5750377 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5750378 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5750379 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5750380 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5750381 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5750382 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5750383 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5750384 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5750385 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5750386 the fake news anchor may be the antidote to fake news which has a habit of showing up in american newspapers
5750387 they have used fringe scientists and fake experts to muddy scientific debates on global warming stem cell research evolution and other matters
5750388 fewer sales compared to a year ago in the four most expensive major markets vancouver victoria calgary and toronto
5750389 who felt that their corporate relocation company actively managed the relocation
5750390 llamadlo como quer is no s ni c mo llamarlo
5750391 ahora mismo trago por un cent metro el que le dej fuera de los tres ltimos tiros qu le voy a hacer puedo decir muchas cosas malas de m mismo pero voy a decir las buenas
5750392 hoy no lanzaba hoy no hab a feeling con el disco lo ponemos as y sale m s bonito qu les voy a decir
5750393 siempre que pierdes que sales as con la mochila se pierden oportunidades las pierdo pero yo soy un luchador soy un t o currante he demostrado que soy un gran disc bolo y aunque no est ah metido y aunque no est con una medalla colgada la gente que me quiere que est conmigo sabe que soy un luchador

5750396 korea is a good team because they won all their previous games and they pitched well today
5750397 but we tried different pitchers because the final stage is more important than today
5750398 ah he doesnt even drive that fast anymore scoffed the head coach of canadas trampoline team
5750399 his insurance rates went up he got a lot of tickets
5750400 but its not like my 11 year old car can get much over 100
5750401 one of my favourite parts of competition actually confessed burnett
5750402 the tension the anxiety of waiting for the scores to pop up
5750403 were over the moon this is awesome said ross of the second trampoline medal in two nights for his sky riders club in toronto coming on the heels of karen cockburns silver on monday in the womens event
5750404 heading into this event we figured 15 of the 15 guys could possibly make finals jason was a little lucky to make the top eight but today we decided to go big and see how it goes he went big he was great the second element in his routine was the hardest of any athlete here today
5750405 a 41 wouldve made me really happy said burnett who owns the federation internationale de gymnastique competition record for dd at 17
5750406 the 40 7 was great but i knew it could be caught by the chinese
5750407 i remember him as a little kid in the gym watching matt turgeon 2000 olympic bronze medallist and jason saying thats cool
5750408 and matt remember used to hold the unofficial dd before jason took it from him
5750409 well the first time i sucked but i tried gymnastics and i was just better on the trampoline i guess it was the right choice
5750410 i think what was the most amazing thing marvelled cockburn joining in an impromptu celebration of family friends and teammates in the press mixed zone as burnett entered wearing his medal
5750411 for someone in his position he handled the pressure so so well
5750412 i just walked right on past him to the bedroom and got my gun
5750413 i said what are you doing in my house he just kept saying he didnt do it
5750414 i just hope i broke up the burglary ring because they have been hitting a lot of places around here
5750415 to err is human and more than likely everyone will have some kind of embarrassing situation in their career lives to greater or lesser degree
5750416 i think its so important whatever the scenario that the person immediately take some kind of action to find out what people are doing and saying and to make an effort to stop the rumour mill that might be happening
5750417 at least its getting off their chest in that room rather than it festering
5750418 the person whos made a poor judgment isnt the first person in the world to do this or the last
5750419 when you look at women and children whose hands and legs have been cut off but who was it who amputated their limbs not charles taylor it was sierra leonian people who did that i love him very much and do not believe he is the evil genius they say
5750420 sorry to wake you doc but i have a 5 year old male en route from a community hospital who has an open fracture of his right femur according to the transferring physician he will need to have a reduction in the operating room tonight while were waiting for you well start morphine for pain relief and some ancef an antiobiotic for infection prophylaxis

5750423 as we are now moving towards the later stages of the consultation
5750424 my worry lines are growing in that this is the worst possible economic climate to be doing anything like this i have got serious worries about whether the department is going to be able to deliver on the proposals even within their own consultation document
5750425 we are concerned that many individuals and their families struggle to cope with changes in peoples behaviours worrying changes without knowing what it is or what to do
5750426 and that is linked to i have to say a poor level of awareness amongst professionals who ought to be in a position to provide some advice
5750427 if we are not seeing substantial improvements in the care being offered to people who have currently got dementia and improved responses to people who are worried they have something wrong with their brains in two to three years time then we will have serious reason to complain
5750428 we may be framing things differently but we are working towards the same kinds of ends
5750429 i think that what the government is doing through the dementia forum is making some progress on a number of fronts
5750430 someone nipping in for 15 minutes to stick a meal in the microwave is not sufficient for a person with dementia
5750431 thats very different to a support oriented service where someone would spend a bit more time and help them do things for themselves and maintain their skills
5750432 the audit we have done shows that people do not get told an awful lot about dementia in their training
5750433 in what they do get told there seems to be an emphasis on the theory rather than the practical
5750434 one of the brilliant things the government did was announce earlier this year that every new nhs premises is expected to be dementia friendly
5750435 at that point in peoples lives when they have first got that diagnosis they need a lot of information they need time they need counselling
5750436 as people progress through the illness the support should follow them
5750437 its up to organisations like us to listen really carefully to people with dementia and their carers about what they need
5750438 we have still got an awful lot to do but there is a good sense of general direction about what needs to be done
5750439 its to get people who are actually involved in the care and the researchers to talk to each other about what has made a difference in everyday life
5750440 this play helps you to understand what it feels like for a person suffering from dementia and having to move into a care home

5750453 tavis smiley presents america i am the african american imprint

5750455 its important to know that there is a back story to barack obama he didnt just fall out of the sky theres a back story that made this moment possible
5750456 so much black history and so much american history thats come out of the great city of pittsburgh

5750534 techdirt reminds us of long standing deals that make social networks into ad publishers for search engines namely microsoft facebook and google myspace
5750535 businessweek is also focusing on the failure of ads on myspace
5750536 bw points out that myspaces division saw an 87 surge in q4 2007 but taken with techdirts points this may only prove that the only people profiting from social network advertising are the networks themselves

5750659 bei rund der haelfte von druckern und multifunktionsgeraeten geht die druckfunktion out of the box wenn ich auch closed source herstellertreiber hinzuzaehle die manchmal schwierig zu installieren sind laufen etwa 70 aller geraete
5750660 exzellent wir sind in intensiver zusammenarbeit mit dem gesamten hplip team 6 sie stellen mir als einziger hersteller testdrucker zur verfuegung ich habe ihnen im gegenzug viel beim treiberdesign geholfen nahezu alles ist freie software die auch die distributionen aufnehmen closed source plugins laden sich bei bedarf automatisch aus dem internet alle ein bis zwei monate kommt eine aktualisierte version hp unterhaelt ein bugtracking system auf launchpad net
5750661 der hersteller liefert freie ppd dateien fuer all seine postscript und pcl geraete updatet oft und leistet offiziellen linux support er hilft auch mit der infrastruktur von open printing der hersteller sorgt auch dafuer das der treiber sicherheitsfunktionen der drucker wie locked print user code document server und so weiter unterstuetzt ricoh beliefert uebrigens auch seine oem partner gestetner infotec lanier nrg savin und in kuerze infoprint vormals ibm mit treibern
5750662 lexmark hat nur ab und zu tintendrucker treiber fuer linux programmiert und die in eher maessiger qualitaet
5750663 dell liefert jede menge drucker mit proprietaeren protokollen gluecklicherweise sind viele modelle eigentlich samsungs die mit dem third party treiber splix 7 funktionieren auch einige xerox drucker sind verkappte splix faehige samsungs aber ansonsten produziert xerox fuer die praxis unbrauchbare cloused source treiber einen kontakt zu treiberentwicklern fuer den europaeischen und den us markt herzustellen ist mir bisher nicht gelungen
5750664 erst recht gehen scanner und fax bei multifunktionsgeraeten nicht zum glueck spielen diese printer am markt keine grosse rolle
5750665 in allen druckerklassen gibt es viele propritaere treiber da diverse distributionen diese nicht aufnehmen laufen die geraete nicht out of the box zudem sind die treiber auf den herstellerseiten oft schwer zu finden binaertreiber lassen sich als userspace software aber dank lsb distributionsunabhaengig paketieren also versuche ich dem problem beizukommen indem ich auf open printing ein automatisches downloadkonzept eingefuehrt habe bei den meisten druckern und multifunktionsgeraeten klappt damit plugnprint heute
5750666 bei patentkonflikten insbesondere wenn geraete komponenten von zulieferern enthalten dauert es mit den linux treibern etwas laenger gegebenenfalls schreibt der hersteller ein clsed source plugin das wird aber nur bei weniger als 10 aller geraete nootig
5750667 die palette gut funktionierender geraete ist sehr breit daher empfehle ich mehrere hersteller und typen abhaengig vom einsatzzweck
5750668 hp fuer den einfachen unkomplizierten fotodruck epson mit gutenprint fuer alle benutzer die die volle kontrolle haben moechten und hohe technische und kuenstlerische ansprueche haben

5750670 made the correct read but hesitated he reloaded and went somewhere else
5750671 but you certainly have to come back the next day and continue to do that weve got a tough way to go here
5750672 it worked out better than i thought it would not that i thought it would go badly it was like starting all over again i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years but thats a good thing i felt like i threw the ball well moved around ok ten days ago i was doing yard work
5750673 it seems to me sen obama would rather lose a war to win a campaign
5750674 i have never suggested that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition
5750675 i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
5750676 i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain when i look out at this audience i see people of different political views you are democrats and republicans and independents but you all served together and fought together and bled together under the same proud flag you did not serve a red america or a blue america you served the united states of america
5750677 there is more to patriotism than a lapel pin or an american legion cap on your head
5750678 patriotism is holding onto and advancing the ideals of liberty and justice just because you didnt serve in the military doesnt mean youre not a patriot and just because you did serve doesnt make you a patriot

5750683 the more conservative element of the christian population is slowly coming to grips with what an obama presidency might be like
5750684 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5750685 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5750686 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5750687 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5750688 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5750689 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5750690 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5750691 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5750692 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5750693 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

5750700 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5750701 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5750702 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5750703 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5750704 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5750705 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5750706 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5750707 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5750708 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5750709 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5750710 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5750711 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5750712 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5750713 who are open to doing something on the production side
5750714 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5750715 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5750716 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5750717 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5750718 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

5750728 the vacillation of data from one month to the next indicates a housing market in transition
5750729 the rise in pending home sales was broad based with all four regions showing gains this is welcome news because a rise in contract activity is necessary for an overall housing recovery with a tax credit now available to first time home buyers increases in home sales could be sustained with the momentum carrying into 2009
5750730 provisions to stem foreclosures are helpful but a greater lift to the economy should come from higher mortgage limits enhancements to the fha loan program and the first time home buyer tax credit
5750731 these are excellent tools that will help buyers get into the market to take advantage of the unprecedented drop in home prices in many areas as well as a wide selection of inventory to make an investment in their future
5750732 buyers entering the hardest hit markets in some cases with multiple bid offers may have put a floor on prices

5750735 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5750736 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5750737 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5750738 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5750739 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5750740 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5750741 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5750742 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5750743 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5750744 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5750745 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5750746 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5750747 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5750748 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5750749 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5750750 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5750751 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5750752 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5750753 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5750754 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5750755 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5750756 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5750757 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5750758 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5750759 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5750760 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5750761 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5750762 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5750763 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5750764 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5750765 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

5750771 fortunately i had a little bit left in reserve from the good position i had throughout the race to conserve energy and i think that was the difference in the last 200m

5750773 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5750774 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5750775 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5750776 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5750777 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5750778 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5750779 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5750780 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5750781 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5750782 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5750783 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5750784 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5750785 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5750786 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5750787 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5750788 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5750789 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5750790 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline

5750792 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5750793 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5750794 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5750795 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5750796 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

5750832 this is a gripping tale of two saviors two men whom god chose to rescue his people two men anyone familiar with history would call heroes among their people two men who represent the best and worst the human experience has to offer this tale is about samson and jesus
5750833 this unique book is a conversational commentary on the life of samson with an eye to our final savior jesus samson is an example of how most of us squander the opportunities god gives us to play a significant role in his story we are an angel in the flame a metaphor of our potential in christ as a messenger of gods love engulfed in his spirit and no matter our choices god still accomplishes his purposes through our lives
5750834 an enigma among the saints who spot the pages of scripture
5750835 as the flame blazed up from the altar toward heaven the angel of the lord ascended in the flame

5750931 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it

5750976 no person has to be a slave to anybody but must rebel against all of the principalities and powers that make human existence subhuman
5750977 the black church in america was founded on the belief that god condemned slavery and that christian freedom meant political emancipation
5750978 came into being when the black clergy realized that killing slave masters was doing the work of god
5750979 those who want to know who god is and what god is doing must know who black persons are and what they are doing
5750980 in america the holy spirit is black persons making decisions about their togetherness which means making preparation for an encounter with whites
5750981 to receive gods revelation is to become black with god by joining god in the work of liberation

5750989 provides no final revelation but calls us to a path whose goal it the word jesus shows in terms of promise
5750990 we cannot use jesus behavior in the first century as a literal guide for our actions in the twentieth century to do so destroys christian freedom the freedom to make decisions patterned on but not dictated by the example of jesus
5750991 in order that this world may remain what it is
5750992 in order that it may transform itself and become what it is promised to be
5750993 of the kingdom of god that is coming to earth

5751024 we assume that a parent after expiration of paid leave in the form of a grant would be able to incur a debt with the commonwealth which provides funds as a partial income replacement for up to six months for each child
5751025 the amount borrowed for one child is assumed to be approximately 14 000 which is the hourly national minimum wage received full time for six months this is doubled for two children
5751026 a cap could be imposed per household to limit the possibility of a large debt on the scheme and the government would determine the size of the cap
5751027 instead of paying employees who take leave employers could receive a subsidy or tax concession

5751040 i want gary glitter to be controlled whilst hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
5751041 gary glitter is an evil sex pervert who preys on children
5751042 now after serving time in vietnam for attacking girls as young as 10 the shameless old has been is on the prowl again
5751043 the authorities should stop him travelling altogether by tearing up his passport
5751044 gary glitter is a persistent offender responsible for a catalogue of sexual crimes against children
5751045 on his return to the uk the authorities must assess the level of risk he poses to children and make sure he is carefully managed and supervised in the community to keep children safe from harm

5751107 we can no longer continue to do the same old things that gave us a reputation for fair value we must reposition ourselves floor to floor offering exciting brand names excellent sales help and frequent sales we need sales staff who know the merchandise and understand customer preferences buying expertise is also critical because fashions and consumer tastes never stay the same we have five strategic goals convert non selling space into revenue generating selling space build up underdeveloped merchandise categories invest aggressively in private brands like polo nautica and tommy hilfiger reduce costs through use of advanced computer systems to project sales and manage inventory improve productivity of sales associates buyers and department heads
5751108 our business has really grown in the last two years we are carrying more specialty and designer clothing lines and have added items we hope will appeal to moderate to high income customers when i came here four years ago i found too many of the human resource operations being performed by the operations manager pat hartlake and one of the department heads rich jenkins since that time i have attempted to set up procedures and policies to assure proper staffing of the store i spend most of my time just managing the human resource department i think it is important to keep abreast of the performance of workers and i like to observe their work habits regularly i also spend a good deal of time on selecting applicants for the sales floor in our business and the employee or one who is in between jobs if a better job came along they would snap it up immediately for example of the 119 part time people hired in the last four months 65 have left
5751109 the main sources of our applicants are newspaper ads and word of mouth by present or past employees we select people based on how well they do in the interview right now i conduct about 25 to 30 interviews a week and perhaps more during the holiday rush i have enough experience in retail to know what it takes to be a good salesperson we place a lot of weight on their motivation personality and drive little or no useful information is gained from high school or college university records or references i do check their application forms for an indication of job stability though
5751110 the training of new salespeople occurs every two weeks and every week during the holiday season
5751111 when i came here discipline was a continual bone of contention between the employees and supervisors
5751112 while we hire our salespeople at the minimum wage we do perform an annual evaluation of their performance to determine merit increases
5751113 for our sales support staff we have supervisors basically evaluate the employees quality and quantity of work
5751114 i have a good working relationship with the human resource department but it took some time to develop that relationship
5751115 let me give you an example of what i mean a few weeks ago i was faced with an employee situation which was evolving to the point where i felt termination was necessary i went to the human resource department to discuss the case to be sure i had covered all bases with all the new laws today one needs to be careful in making decisions they never seem to be able to produce answers to questions without hedging i had to wait almost two weeks before i got any help from them in the meantime the situation with the employee continued to deteriorate i can understand their reluctance to terminate sales staff because of the difficulty in recruiting new people in a way however the old system seemed to be a lot less complicated department managers knew how to handle situations that came up in their departments dont get me wrong i know that as we continue to grow were probably going to need an even larger human resource department

5751144 it will cost us money halving the size of the bin does not half the waste in a household
5751145 the councils must be aware that their responsibility is to provide a service to the general public not to punish us or fine us but to get us to work with them so we can see recycling rates shoot up
5751146 smaller bins create problems in that if you do the same round with smaller bins you still need to do the round as often and often residents like that because it can be weekly
5751147 but then what happens is the truck is doing the same round consuming the same fuel polluting the atmosphere to the same amount but now only half full
5751148 we will collect the 140 bin weekly our residents were concerned about odour and flies weve listened to them and we wont go ahead with alternate weekly collections

5751155 i gilberto gil brazilian citizen world citizen and minister of culture of brazil develop my work in music in the ministry and in all the dimensions of my existence under the inspiration of hacker ethics i am concerned about the issues that my world and my time pose to me such as the issue of the digital divide of free software and also the issue of regulation and development of audiovisual content production and distribution by any media for any purpose
5751156 in the audiovisual sector the economic environment is being rearranged and the ownership concentration is growing big telecom companies are acquiring smaller companies from the movies media journalism and entertainment sectors generating mega corporations eager to conquer new markets these companies are able to maintain powerfull relations with their own rich governments while also promoting interest based relations with its poor countries hosts they perform political strategies to take down what they call barriers and fight against ownership concentration regulations in their home countries it makes sense it is important to mention those strategies are performed by highly competent and proactive state bureaucracies making use of all kinds of resources
5751157 the motion picture association of america mpaa threatened brazil with commercial retaliation if the government continued its plans to create ancinav
5751158 we need to relocate what is now centralized in the hands of few the majors of the cultural industry havent left anything for the peripheries thats why today the role of the brazilian state in formulating public policies is to empower the micro manifestations so that they become able to occupy the public spaces while being protagonists of the promotion and protection of diversity
5751159 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition

5751188 we are living at a moment in which the massive outward migration of the affluent that characterized the second half of the 20th century is coming to an end

5751191 if the first and lowest operation of pain shatters the illusion that all is well the second shatters the illusion that what we have whether good or bad in itself is our own and enough for us the third shatters the illusion of the self sufficiency the full acting out of the selfs surrender to god demands pain this action to be perfect must be done from the pure will to obey in the absence or in the teeth of inclination
5751192 if its meant to happen itll happen sooner or later
5751193 suffering is not good in itself what is good in any painful experience is for the sufferer his submission to the will of god and for the spectators the compassion aroused and the acts of mercy to which it leads
5751194 when i think of pain of anxiety that gnaws like fire and loneliness that spreads out like a desert and the heartbreaking routine of monotonous misery or again of dull aches that blacken our whole landscape or sudden nauseating pains that knock a mans heart out at one blow or pains that seem already intolerable and then are suddenly increased of infuriating scorpion stinging pains that startle into maniacal movement of a man who seemed half dead with his previous tortures it quite oercrows my spirit
5751195 i have seen great beauty of spirit in some who were great sufferers i have seen men for the most part grow better not worse with advancing years and i have seen the last illness produce treasures of fortitude and meekness from most unpromising subjects

5751240 diabetes mellitus is a syndrome of disordered metabolism usually due to a combination of hereditary and environmental causes resulting in abnormally high blood sugar levels hyperglycemia blood glucose levels are controlled by the hormone insulin made in the beta cells of the pancreas the two most common forms of diabetes are due to either a diminished production of insulin in type 1 or diminished response by the body to insulin in type 2 and gestational both lead to hyperglycemia which largely causes the acute signs of diabetes excessive urine production resulting compensatory thirst and increased fluid intake blurred vision unexplained weight loss lethargy and changes in energy metabolism all types of diabetes have been treatable since insulin became medically available in 1921 but there is no widely available cure for any form of diabetes type 1 diabetes can only be treated with injected insulin with dietary and other lifestyle adjustments commonly being part of the treatment type 2 is usually managed with a combination of dietary treatment tablets and frequently insulin supplementation insulin can also be delivered continuously by a specialized pump which provides subcutaneous insulin through a temporary catheter diabetes and its treatments can cause many complications acute complications hypoglycemia ketoacidosis or nonketotic hyperosmolar coma may occur if the disease is not adequately controlled serious long term complications i e chronic side effects include cardiovascular disease doubled risk chronic renal failure retinal damage which can lead to blindness nerve damage of several kinds and microvascular damage which may cause impotence and poor wound healing poor healing of wounds particularly of the feet can lead to gangrene and possibly to amputation adequate treatment of diabetes as well as increased emphasis on blood pressure control and lifestyle factors such as not smoking and maintaining a healthy body weight may improve the risk profile of most of the chronic complications in the developed world diabetes is the most significant cause of adult blindness in the non elderly and the leading cause of non traumatic amputation in adults and diabetic nephropathy is the main illness requiring renal dialysis in the united states

5751255 just the other day i was standing in line at the grocery store and there was a guy next to me thats all he wanted to talk about we cant get away from it everywhere we go everybody wants to talk about kentucky
5751256 were putting down big south logos on our floor instead of the atlantic sun logos
5751257 last season we tried to play as many big south schools as we could play so we could get a feel for the league we tried to get as much tape on those teams as we could get our hands on this move is going to be hard and it might take a few years for us to get settled but were doing as much as we can to prepare
5751258 im looking forward to playing those guys twice every year
5751259 they give us a goal to shoot for winthrop is definitely the team to beat until somebody can top them on a consistent basis theyre going to be the kings of the court in the big south and they ought to be they deserve it theyve been beyond spectacular
5751260 but they have six of their top seven leading scorers coming back i know that what they try to do is try and spread you out defensively and they really rely heavily on their ability to shoot the 3
5751261 as for getting his rebounds back i dont know yet but the good news is that every one of our returning guys wanted to come back to campus early we havent had that problem in a long time usually they wait until the last minute and take as long as they can
5751262 theyll remember presbyterian coming in here theyll remember high point unc asheville all those people theyll be fired up
5751263 were a team thats been built on our ability to guard
5751264 thats not going to change thats our primary staple were going to work hard at it every single day because thats what were all about
5751265 i think at his time hes in the best physical health hes been in since he was high school

5751273 that the united states would be obliged to defend poland in case of an attack with greater speed than required under nato
5751274 this is the old trick used by conservatives use the crisis of the moment to support a pre existing agenda
5751275 the iraq war was the most serious hoax on the american people but it was preceded by the push to deploy anti missile weapons after the attack of september 11 president bush used that tragedy to increase spending for anti missile systems and to pull out of the anti ballistic missile treaty the fact that terrorists dont have missiles and that the attacks had nothing whatsoever to do with the anti missile systems didnt matter the tactic worked the democrats in congress folded least they look weak 60 billion and several broken treaties later we still dont have an anti missile weapon that works and osama bin laden is cavorting safely in northern pakistan they are at it again this time using the russia georgia conflict to justify a project they fear is slipping away for the past two years the administration has been insisting that the weapons were aimed at iran not russia suddenly the line has shifted led by senator john mccain whose foreign policy seems to have been completely captured by the neoconservatives they have left one dying host to infect another
5751276 the us does not need a rush to deploy a technology that doesnt work against a threat that doesnt exist
5751277 the senate and the house armed services committees have wisely restricted any funding for missile systems in poland or the czech republic until both parliaments approve the plan and the proposed weapons republicans may try to strike that language from the bill in the senate this september this is a test for the democrats are they strong enough to stand by their convictions will they expose this placebo defense and the hypocrites who push it or will we see the traditional democratic dive on defense september will tell us a great deal about whether the new obama led party is serious about charting a new course
5751278 this is not just about missile defense this is about demonstrating to russia that america is still a nation of resolve and were not going to let russian expansionism intimidate everyone

5751282 we placed a renewed focus on the business space starting in the early part of 2007
5751283 our direct marketing comes down to doing the basics very well at a greater level our loyalty efforts come back to sales rep resentatives and dedicated customer care representatives they have the relationships with the decision mak ers and they do a great job of answer ing questions and helping maximize products and services
5751284 the package is part of a larger campaign effort in the business space to talk in a relevant way about the products and services we are putting forward
5751285 we have such a wide variety of products and services many of which most consumers have never even heard of but they are relevant to a very niche audience
5751286 overall our b to b strat egy is really about identifying the right customer set and making sure that we put all of the relevant infor mation in front of them
5751287 the sales team is critical in terms of both meeting with potential cus tomers and identifying customer needs
5751288 it also pro vides additional data points that make our lists better and stronger
5751289 the services were talking about in the b to b space when you move beyond the small office can be com plex
5751290 they need to be tailored to individual businesses based on size location and need so the leads we generate are passed on to account managers who meet with the customer sit down and have that conversation when you think about the specialized nature of our products and the customization that off the shelf products need theyre best served in a face to face meeting
5751291 for us the core of driving loyalty in the b to b space is providing great service in both device function and customer service
5751292 our efforts in the direct and crm space are designed to build those meaningful relationships and offer great products and service to new customers and prospects
5751293 we wanted to send prospects something with some heft that would make it through and actually get opened
5751294 the b to b side is very much connected with the sales force its very much a relationship driven program
5751295 theres a looming cloud that decreasing album sales are somehow decreasing the music experience but in reality whats happening is that artists are just finding new ways to reach their fans
5751296 there are so many artists out there people are somewhat jaded from having too many options
5751297 you have to offer things that are more compelling that allow the consumer to get to know the artist and have the artist interact directly with fans
5751298 those younger fans are not as engaged with e mail
5751299 the tie between mobile and online is going to become more and more relevant
5751300 combining the web with offline real world events is important and the mobile phone is at the heart of that effort
5751301 three or four years ago we were managing mailing lists and trying to get press interviews but when a band has hundreds of thousands of fans on a social networking site posting an online bulletin can be more relevant than an e mail list
5751302 now its more about complete creative integration the goal is to become part of the sites that people go to
5751303 at the end of the day the record company is our client and results arent as tangible as they used to be
5751304 i could show you how popular a band is compared to another through video streams downloads and engagements but this may not correlate directly to record sales
5751305 online promo tion can actually lead to increasing numbers in the traditional space usership in the digital music space has only gone up
5751306 were still a maturing industry and its exciting to see how its going to change
5751307 costco is trying to do cool new things combining the ways that they communicate with customers across memberships and promotions
5751308 leverage is giving costco a way to talk to customers in a way that is micro targeted and timed correctly so rather than being interrupted by commercials the communication only happens when consumers log into their leverage account
5751309 we are excited to welcome pc tools into the symantec consumer family and believe the combination of our two companies will provide additional value and choice for consumers worldwide to better enable and protect their digital life
5751310 by adding pc tools we build on the market leading success of symantecs consumer offerings and firmly position ourselves for continued incremental growth in a rapidly expanding market
5751311 the mpa board expressed to me that they were interested in doing something to demonstrate mpas commitment to supporting the retail side of the business and that publishers are committed to supporting the retail channel
5751312 this is just a test and we wanted to test a retailer that we felt was a good sample there were a number of criteria like scale budget and demographics meijer is from the middle of the country geographically and demographically so we thought it would be a good sample
5751313 you want people to discuss your brand with their friends
5751314 this was a chance to advertise between consumers not just in front of them
5751315 it wasnt a standard display banner that said click here
5751316 it asked which friends youd like to take along on a virtual joyride and included the names and photos of some of the users friends in the ad

5751321 when nazi germany seized control of czechoslovakia in 1938 appeaser extraordinaire neville chamberlain referred to it as
5751322 the unsatiable appetites of an expansionist power led by a coldly calculating mass murderer
5751323 the insatiable appetites of an expansionist power are those of an expansionist islam which early on set its sights on the balkans
5751324 one cannot at the same time recognize kosovos independence from serbia and reiterate that georgias territorial integrity must be respected as regards south ossetia and abkhazia
5751325 if one recognizes serbias territorial integrity in kosovo he should better keep silent on georgias territorial integrity
5751326 one cannot act as if nothing happened in south ossetia bombing of civilian population massacres of minorities and murders of russian peacekeepers committed by the tbilisi authorities on the other hand what nato did in yugoslavia including killing civilians destroying bridges on the danube and tv stations in belgrade denies it the right to criticize russia for any present or future actions
5751327 it makes sense on several levels for envy to launch in austin
5751328 theres a really big film and music community and theres also a really good college crowd that goes out a lot a lot of people seem to stay after college and there really isnt anything like envy in the city
5751329 hopefully it will capture their interests because the magazines that usually target that age group are not edgy
5751330 the timing is perfect because people both need and desire to do good things and give back and help the environment they want to make changes in their own environments and their everyday experiences but still want to read a magazine
5751331 when i started as a carer i knew it was a hard job but i had no idea that at the end of it i would feel this upset now im absolutely terrified of getting old

5751333 this is great but it will never work in america
5751334 dikke mensen dreigen de parias van onze samenleving te worden
5751335 op overgewicht rust een negatief stigma waar ook kinderen onder lijden dikke mensen zouden lui zijn geen zelfbeheersing hebben en onaantrekkelijk zijn campagnes tegen overgewicht die de boodschap hebben dat overgewicht slecht is dat dikke mensen ongezond en ongelukkig zijn en een kostenpost vormen voor de maatschappij versterken het negatieve beeld van dikke mensen nog eens sociale uitsluiting begint al zeer jong
5751336 kinderen nemen die norm over uit hun omgeving bijvoorbeeld van de media vrienden op school en hun ouders
5751337 ik denk dat deze campagnes ervoor zorgen dat ouders en kinderen meer op hun gewicht gaan letten dit is op zich geen probleem alleen de focus zou niet moeten liggen op het echte lijnen maar juist meer op gezonde gewoonten
5751338 nu al lopen op schoolpleinen meisjes van dertien rond die aan de lijn doen volgens een studie van tno heeft acht op de tien meisjes van 13 tot 18 jaar wel eens een dieet gevolgd ook jonge kinderen met een normaal gewicht en zelfs kinderen met een ndergewicht doen aan de lijn
5751339 de menus uit het boek van sonja bakker geen gezond eetpatroon vormen voor kinderen ze bevatten veel te weinig brood weinig groente en veel melk producten verder is een dieet in tegenspraak met de algemeen geaccepteerde uitgangspunten voor de aanpak van overgewicht bij kinderen
5751340 aanleiding voor dit onderscheid is de bevinding dat een voeding met een lager vetgehalte het lichaamsgewicht kan doen dalen het effect op het lichaamsgewicht is bescheiden een voeding met een kwart minder vet doet het lichaamsgewicht dalen met naar schatting gemiddeld twee tot drie kilogram
5751341 voorlichters moeten erg oppassen dat ze andere gezondheidsdimensies geen kwaad doen in hun pogingen obesitas bij kinderen te genezen of voorkomen

5751375 political pollsters love the beer buddy question namely to ask voters which candidate theyd most want to hang out with over a couple of cold ones or a cup of coffee but i prefer to use the godfather or godmother test what that means pick a candidate as if your childs life depended on it while liking the politician should be part of your thought process having a best pal in the oval office isn t enough the decisions made by the next president will help determine whether your children will have to fight in wars how dependent theyll be on foreign oil and whether medicare and social security will be there when they retire vote for the candidate who has the competence and character to guide your child and the country

5751399 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
5751400 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
5751401 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
5751402 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

5751489 russian forces blocked access to the citys naval and commercial ports on tuesday morning and towed the missile boat dioskuria one of the navys most sophisticated vessels out of sight of observers a loud explosion was heard minutes later
5751490 several hours later an associated press photographer saw russian trucks and armored personnel carriers leaving the port with about 20 blindfolded and handcuffed men riding on them port spokesman eduard mashevoriani said the men were georgian soldiers
5751491 im very happy that we can talk about this subject very very happy
5751492 you dont understand theres a room they take us into

5751495 its not fair to owen because he really cares for her and ends up getting hurt
5751496 the population of the country is aging and people now live with chronic diseases longer so its important to understand from a health perspective how people are being treated as they age
5751497 older people with any physical vulnerability are about 13 percent more likely than those without one to report verbal mistreatment but are not more likely to report financial mistreatment
5751498 perhaps the respondents are including fairly routine arguments perhaps about money with their spouse sibling or child in their reports or perhaps older adults are more reticent to report negative behavior

5751503 these results suggest that a portion of corn stover could be harvested for biofuel production without reducing soil organic carbon levels in high yielding systems however since this study did not study the direct impact of stover removal that aspect remains to be evaluated
5751504 i think the key thing is working on the small things things that i can handle and i can control its not getting frustrated just conditioning and getting the work done

5751513 these findings suggest that it is important children first learn how to calculate answers on their own but after that initial phase using calculators is a fine thing to do even for basic multiplication facts
5751514 the study indicates technology such as calculators can help kids who already have a strong foundation in basic skills
5751515 for students who did not know many multiplication facts generating the answers on their own without a calculator was important and helped their performance on subsequent tests
5751516 but for students who already knew some multiplication facts it didnt matter using a calculator to practice neither helped nor harmed them
5751517 teachers struggle with how to give kids immediate feedback which we know speeds the learning process so another use for calculators is allowing students to use them to check the answers they have come up with by themselves giving them immediate feedback and more time for practice
5751518 kids enjoyed them its one way to make memorizing your multiplication facts a more interesting thing to do
5751519 so much of how you teach depends on how you market the material presentation is very important to kids
5751520 many of these students had never used a calculator before so it added a fun aspect to math class for them
5751521 diabetes mellitus is a syndrome of disordered metabolism usually due to a combination of hereditary and environmental causes resulting in abnormally high blood sugar levels hyperglycemia blood glucose levels are controlled by the hormone insulin made in the beta cells of the pancreas the two most common forms of diabetes are due to either a diminished production of insulin in type 1 or diminished response by the body to insulin in type 2 and gestational both lead to hyperglycemia which largely causes the acute signs of diabetes excessive urine production resulting compensatory thirst and increased fluid intake blurred vision unexplained weight loss lethargy and changes in energy metabolism all types of diabetes have been treatable since insulin became medically available in 1921 but there is no widely available cure for any form of diabetes type 1 diabetes can only be treated with injected insulin with dietary and other lifestyle adjustments commonly being part of the treatment type 2 is usually managed with a combination of dietary treatment tablets and frequently insulin supplementation insulin can also be delivered continuously by a specialized pump which provides subcutaneous insulin through a temporary catheter diabetes and its treatments can cause many complications acute complications hypoglycemia ketoacidosis or nonketotic hyperosmolar coma may occur if the disease is not adequately controlled serious long term complications i e chronic side effects include cardiovascular disease doubled risk chronic renal failure retinal damage which can lead to blindness nerve damage of several kinds and microvascular damage which may cause impotence and poor wound healing poor healing of wounds particularly of the feet can lead to gangrene and possibly to amputation adequate treatment of diabetes as well as increased emphasis on blood pressure control and lifestyle factors such as not smoking and maintaining a healthy body weight may improve the risk profile of most of the chronic complications in the developed world diabetes is the most significant cause of adult blindness in the non elderly and the leading cause of non traumatic amputation in adults and diabetic nephropathy is the main illness requiring renal dialysis in the united states
5751522 for years i had struggled with my own personal health battles like so many of us in this great country i did everything medical doctors told me to do unfortunately my health battles were not getting any better thats when i decided to take personal responsibility for my health quality health and well being comes as a result of making good choices for your self and thank god we live in a country that allows us free liberty it is your health and your responsibility and no one cares about your health more than you because of new found studies through modern day technology advances in alternative medicine have made it easier for us to make safer choices of good health than ever before although some but not most prescription drugs have their place alternative medicine is becoming more and more acceptable because they are safer and more effective let me now share with you some important facts that can dramatically change your personal health and well being for the better
5751523 he was going to project a message that said free tibet and some other messages that would have been three stories high in different locations in beijing
5751524 if you were president what would be the first thing you would do
5751525 you dont have to wait until youre president to do that you can come over to my house and mow pull weeds and sweep my yard and ill pay you 50 then ill take you over to the grocery store where there is a homeless guy that hangs out there you can give him the 50 to use toward a new house
5751526 why doesnt the homeless guy come over and do the work and you can just pay him the 50
5751527 though many promising policies have emerged to promote physical activity and good nutrition in communities
5751528 they are not being adopted or implemented at levels needed to turn around this health crisis

5751532 because now that 22 83 was really easy everybody else had to run harder because they didnt get that feeling the first round
5751533 now its rest and still fine tune for the final i really held my form better than i have any other time
5751534 my dad was like oh they should have re started it
5751535 and my mom was like its ok you ran really good they made me laugh and i forgot about it for a couple of minutes when you need a hug always go to mom and its always great
5751536 i couldnt sleep that night i got a really bad migraine
5751537 but now its like settling down i just really tried to relax and focus and block it out
5751538 he told me he was really upset about the no call on the false start but it was one of the best races of my life regardless
5751539 if you go back and time it from when i reacted i had a better time than the winner hes happy with it
5751540 yeah that sounds like their trying to gain some credibility
5751541 lets have a serious debate and lets debate our disagreements on the merits of policy not personal attacks
5751542 i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest
5751543 now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same i will let no one question my love of this country
5751544 i reiterate my demand that russia abide by the cease fire
5751545 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
5751546 seems to be talking out of both sides of his mouth
5751547 mccain in my personal opinion has more experience on foreign affairs than obama and has served in the military i think thats important
5751548 hahaha let go theyd lose a lot of those ki
5751549 obviously well comment from a partisan point of view we will have a press conference and otherwise be available to the media to comment from our perspective
5751550 i always saw myself with the gold medal i really did
5751551 we call her the terminator back home shes been a father and a mother shes such a tough lady
5751552 shes so proud shes so happy shes probably not going to be able to sleep tonight
5751553 she has done so much for us i wish i could just give her the medal right now because thats who it is going to go to
5751554 we didnt have a choice whether we went to church or not one time she took me there without my t shirt she would always have that god factor in our lives
5751555 she gets nauseous half the time shes in the bathroom getting sick
5751556 he wanted to do things his own way we didnt see eye to eye sometimes
5751557 hahaha let go theyd lose a lot of those ki
5751558 what are we going to play when i come over
5751559 eigentlich k nntest du dich mal wieder vors mikrofon h ngen und den leutchen was erz hlen
5751560 this is something every single one of us can do without sacrificing anything
5751561 just lighten up turn the lead in your right foot into gold in your pocket
5751562 were not really eager to embrace mandates but it has turned out that its not possible to drive 55 on the roadways because so many people are speeding around at 80 or 85 mph
5751563 if you want to drive slower drive in the right hand lane the faster traffic can go by on the left hand side
5751564 we really have to educate people about how much of an impact this can make
5751565 its not just a little bit like some detractors like to say this is significant a major amount of energy could be saved
5751566 the driver was devastated because it is a new car and although there was no superficial damage i dread to think what its like underneath
5751567 i cant believe it managed to stay on all four wheels
5751568 i didnt stay to see them free the car but they would have had one heck of a job towing it out
5751569 the only way was to winch it all the way back up
5751570 identical to engines that moved freight cars along the west side from the 1940s to the 1980s
5751571 it is impossible to distinguish evil from good unless one has an infinite reference point which is absolutely good
5751572 this is our third cd our first was a self titled cd with half original and half bluegrass tunes we released purgatory mountain in early 2006 which was our first album of all original music
5751573 the new album greetings from jackass flats is also all original music we recorded the new cd at sound of music here in richmond we love recording our first trip into the studio was tough because we were face to face with what we really sounded like and we struggled to get what we wanted now once we get the tunes written and arranged we cant wait to flesh out our ideas in the studio on the new disc we added some strings to a couple of songs and put down some textured vocals hell were already thinking about crazy production ideas for the next record
5751574 originality has never been a necessary aspect of bluegrass songwriting
5751575 there are some of us who will fight and fight again to save the party we love
5751576 it is the necessary nature of a political party in this country to avoid as long as it can be avoided the consideration of any question which involves a great change
5751577 and youre giving a treat penny ice and cold meat to a party of friends and relations
5751578 then none was for a party then all were for the state
5751579 was terminated not for the gender neutral condition of infertility but rather for the gender specific quality of childbearing capacity
5751580 it makes sense to conclude that the pda was intended to cover a womans intention or potential to become pregnant because all that conclusion means is that discrimination against persons who intend to or can potentially become pregnant is discrimination against women which is the kind of truism the pda wrote into law
5751581 a modern day fairytale of heroes villains love manchester united and what it means to lead your country
5751582 simply keeping a lid on 90210 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night and letting all our constituents see it at the same time
5751583 this is about a publishers commitment to its author to get one of a very few pro obama books out into the marketplace in the shortest amount of time
5751584 our initial order was based on the book being available to all booksellers simultaneously an even playing field
5751585 they are not going to bully us and the book will be a huge success in spite of their boycott
5751586 if i ran 9 6 shutting it down i would be too
5751587 that was a great showcase of what the final will be like
5751588 there is no doubt you dont give athletes full due process
5751589 you have to maintain the credibility of the spectacle so you need to deal quickly with any investigation of doping
5751590 if you get a positive test you have already lost
5751591 our legal team will make certain that the rights of an athlete are preserved and due process is followed
5751592 my private life is my private life i have to keep something private you guys know everything else
5751593 i look forward to getting home and being able to spend some time with her
5751594 thank god this one man show which was behind all the major scandals of the past nine years is over
5751595 i failed you im a loser i violated the national constitution with impunity now im outta here
5751596 people for the most part welcomed musharrafs decision to step down after nine years as chief executive
5751597 however the public was also aware of the fact that his resignation will lead to a tough period for the nation it seemed that the masses were expecting such an announcement with dozens of television shops in saddar packed with people eager to witness what turned out to be musharrafs final speech the actual announcement led to scenes of exhilaration with people congratulating each other and a few shopkeepers distributing sweets
5751598 although it is unlikely his resignation will bring any major improvements in the political scenario or ease the publics sufferings we are hoping against hope that the coalition government will work to alleviate the misery of the masses
5751599 i am delighted that we have been relieved of this dictator who with the support of the u s imposed unlawful policies in the country for nine years
5751600 to avoid an impending impeachment ending a weeks long political standoff and bringing the curtain down on eight years and ten months of turbulent rule musharraf said he had made the decision to avoid confrontation between state institutions that could make a military intervention possible after viewing the situation and consulting legal advisers and political allies with their advice i have decided to resign today he said he said he was ready to face impeachment but that the process would create tension among the parliament the judiciary and the presidency
5751601 it is not a time for individual bravado to me pakistan was always first it remains so and will always be first
5751602 overstayed his welcome partly because he believed the political coalition that has governed pakistan since last februarys elections was fragile and would crack soon
5751603 partly because the u s particularly vice president dick cheney was loath to let him go
5751604 believed he could play out a final tactical victory in the fluid situation between the army pakistani politicians and the taliban
5751605 civilian government should be able to concentrate on two main tasks fixing the economy and crafting a strategy against the taliban ultimately finding a better way of arresting the talibanization of pakistan
5751606 achieved sweeping gains to become the second largest group in pakistans national parliament
5751607 t heir next test will come in the coming weeks when the election to the presidents post is decided
5751608 bilawal bhutto chairman of the ppp has already staked his partys claim to the post what kind of a presidency would it be would sharif get his way and strip the presidency of its power to dissolve parliament none of this is clear
5751609 ppp could lose ground because they did support general musharraf
5751610 to go back to sharifs pml n that would give sharif a huge advantage
5751611 r ecent visitors to pakistan have felt that while the war against the taliban may be a priority in the rest of the world it was not really so inside the pakistan establishment
5751612 i leave my future to the people of pakistan let them be the judges and let them do the justice
5751613 after nine years in one of the worlds most dangerous political jobs he and his family must soon return to a civilian world teeming with politicians separatists and islamists who would like to see him jailed or dead
5751614 his own choice would be to stay in a house that he is building on his five acre farm on the outskirts of islamabad but he risks prosecution by his political enemies if he stays in pakistan a risk that will increase if the government reinstates the judges he dismissed last year he would also be a certain target for the islamic militants who have already made three attempts on his life as president he was protected by a relatively well trained army now he will be entitled to protection only by the police whose shortcomings were exposed by benazir bhuttos assassination last year if the government does not grant him military protection as well as immunity from prosecution he will probably be forced overseas d iplomatic sources say he is unlikely to move to britain not least because of the security threats from al qaeda and the taliban
5751615 it is considered too sexy for us its not good for viewers in malaysia
5751616 we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are good role models
5751617 rebuilding the liberal party after the 2007 federal election defeat was always going to be difficult
5751618 lucky charms include among other things our own hanuman http www time com time politics whitehouse photos 0 27424 1811278 00 html
5751619 we have two cages in aaran cove and 14 in hardy cove which are both about nine km from st albans
5751620 by december of this year we will have about 500 000 rainbow trout in our cages
5751621 we have grow out sites in ontario and nova scotia but we needed more farms to produce more product for our customer base we were buying fish from nova fish farms so we decided to buy the company in 2007
5751622 the coast of bays has the best trout growing conditions in newfoundland as the water temperatures are suited to the venture in addition the environment provides protection against ice and storms
5751623 as our market base grows we definitely expect our volumes to grow in the province we dont grow fish that we dont already have a market for we establish relationships with our customers on how they want their product and our farming and processing goes from there
5751624 in ontario and nova scotia we have our own hatcheries grow out sites and processing plants
5751625 this is the way we like to set up an operation so a cwf hatchery and processing plant could be in the cards for newfoundland
5751626 were very concerned about the environment if one of our grow out sites became polluted or unsatisfactory for use by some other reason we stand to lose millions of dollars
5751627 were not in the game to lose money like that
5751628 r yan pile the self conjure up subliminal self once
5751629 shes okay outside of if ethical self doesnt reckon would i myself market they a mad round
5751630 he just worked hard and took care of his daughter
5751631 thats not jonathan he would never not come home never not without calling
5751632 weve had a number of people fall off that cliff for different reasons
5751633 im not trying to minimize the situation where people go to the area where they probably shouldnt be going anyways but its like driving down a road where you probably shouldnt be going too fast without a guardrail
5751634 he rappelled from the railing to the fall zone to investigate the entire area for anything we could not see from the ground
5751635 joe had i think a very tough job with all the family there he was behind the yellow rope keeping us calm talking and communicating with us he was fantastic
5751636 before she passed away family members told her when she gets to heaven to please find jonathan
5751637 they found him within an hour of her passing so we kind of feel like she might have led them there
5751638 you gotta grab on to whatever you can right now to get through
5751639 the damage that i saw was consistent with a tornado touchdown
5751640 its clear that the damage was in a very linear fashion
5751641 id say get out of a mobile home because its like a cracker box
5751642 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
5751643 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
5751644 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
5751645 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
5751646 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
5751647 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
5751648 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
5751649 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers
5751650 met ons telefoonnummer achter de ruit mag de politie hoedanook niet takelen

5751768 my father passed away from cancer five years ago in october and thats why i put everything in the cancer benefit in memory of my dad
5751769 i went to see a friend of mine out in stephenville and asked her if she would help me she came down one year and helped me go door to door the next year i sent some tickets out to her and some tickets to florence gray of shoe cove i met florence in st johns and i asked her then if she would help me sell tickets which she did
5751770 both ladies raised over 100 for me i met another lady from seal cove debbie loveless and she offered to help me i have a lot of friends who wanted to help
5751771 they could only give me 2 000 tickets because they had to balance everything out and the quilt had to be showcased at the cancer benefit once i got to the benefit i only had 130 tickets to sell by 3 30 p m i never had the single ticket left
5751772 i had three baskets and said that i would stay there and raise more money because i knew that i could raise more money i made another 100 on the baskets that i had made i know that i could have sold another 1 000 tickets that day
5751773 i never went to morrisville and i only did about three per cent of the houses in conne river and thats where im from thats where my dad lived and thats where all of his brothers and sisters are from i just never had any tickets left to finish conne river i stopped selling my tickets three and a half weeks before the benefit and i had about 130 tickets left
5751774 there was nothing under 25 from each house everybody bought those tickets like crazy i had people phone me from milltown people call from morrisville and people even called me from st johns and i couldnt even put any tickets in the mail for them i have a list of people that called me and they didnt want a single book they wanted five books
5751775 i beaded a quilt the first year and it took me seven months to bead i had seven blocks and i painted each block i had four blue roses on each block and i had preying hands in the middle by the time the quilt was finished it had cost me 980 i passed it into the cancer benefit and they made 3 500 on that quilt and do you know what a friend of mine won it and gave it back to me i started to cry when i passed it in because it was a special quilt
5751776 i had white beads on the quilt and each bead represents the days from the time my dad found out he had cancer to the day he died thats why i wanted it back and i said to myself i dont care how much i have to pay i want that quilt back but my friend won it and gave it back to me it was a miracle
5751777 all we know is that some person s cut four hydraulic lines slashed a tire and put sand in the fuel and transmission tanks in the towns loader
5751778 to be successful the police cannot work alone in no instance do the police work alone during investigations we need the public to be involved to help the police and to hold people accountable for their actions
5751779 if youre not held accountable theres no consequences and the action will continue were really asking those that have information to come forward and help us along with our investigation
5751780 if anyone knows who did this the town will offer a reward i cant tell you what that reward is until we have our council meeting we will let the public know how much the reward is after the meeting
5751781 i was out of town for a few days and when i got back on monday the foreman told me that the loader had been sabotaged over the weekend when i came to take a look and see what was done i thought that it had to be done by someone sick
5751782 it had to be planned someone came here with a hacksaw to saw off the hydraulic lines and put sand in the fuel and transmission tanks and then sabotaged a 1 000 tire this loader means so much to the town because we use it if theres a waterline break we now have to go outside to bring in a loader and thats going to be costly
5751783 we dont even know if other damage has been done mayor may said
5751784 we wont know what else was done until a mechanic takes a look at it
5751785 theres no pattern that we know of other than the fact that theres a criminal element at work its frustrating to us because theres ongoing crime we havent been able to hold anyone accountable thus far
5751786 however theres no doubt in my mind that members of the public have valuable information and are hesitant to come forward that hinders our investigation because we cant be there all the time unfortunately members of that community are the ones that own that community and they should bring any information forward so we can put it to action and hold people responsible for these things

5751950 what drove us to netsuite was both its lower cost and greater feature set
5751951 we needed our crm data integrated with our accounting and erp data providing a complete solution to provide better all around support to our customers netsuite provided more out of the box functionality at a much lower investment on the order of thousands of dollars compared to the great plains microsoft crm combination netsuite gives us everything in one system and its web based saving our residential program even more money because we dont need to invest in and maintain a client server architecture like our parent company needed for great plains
5751952 after a little more than two years of using great plains and salesforce com we decided we really needed a completely integrated system to gain better visibility so we switched to netsuite
5751953 the problem with great plains was that it didnt allow the operations group to view vendor and customer related information with netsuites integrated platform both our operations group and accounting group are much more effective and efficient without added costs of great plains licenses on top of salesforce com licenses additionally the ability to access our accounting information along with crm data from anywhere in the country is a huge benefit for our company we fully utilize the netsuite accounting functionality as well as sales force automation and email marketing campaigns on a daily basis
5751954 weve been using it for about six months now and its drastically better than microsoft great plains which was too complex with netsuite we can purchase product create orders for customers and then ship collect money and support those customers and pay our bills we can see more metrics across the business because we dont require integration with other systems
5751955 the best thing about netsuite is its ease of use
5751956 great plains required a lot of time effort and help from external developer and consulting resources that added to the on going cost of maintenance we had to use separate applications with it and it wasnt smooth to pass from one application to another with netsuite everything is integrated and we have real time access across all our core business operations

5751977 a change of leadership in washington will not lift this burden in this new century americans and europeans alike will be required to do more not less
5751978 destruction or surrender of something for the sake of something else
5751979 this is our moment this is our time i know my country has not been perfect itself at times we struggled to keep the promise of liberty and equality of all people
5751980 that our wish as well as theirs is that the public efforts may be directed honestly to the public good that peace be cultivated civil and religious liberty unassailed law and order preserved equality of rights maintained and that state of property equal or unequal which results to every man from his own industry or that of his fathers
5751981 the bearing of a load usually used in the phrase beast of burden

5751990 pode dizer se que criou uma segunda f rmula seguida tamb m por um par de outras obras menos conhecidas
5751991 n o um filme de terror naquele sentido em que nos assusta pelo que mostra ou por imagens demasiado gr ficas mas por aquilo que n o mostra
5751992 assusta porque n o nos explica nada e apenas nos vai mostrando uma sucess o de acontecimentos que adensam o mist rio criando muito devagar e sem pressas nenhumas um clima de medo e tens o insuport vel que nos d lentamente cabo dos nervos
5751993 n o uma hist ria para assustar momentaneamente em segmentos para nos fazer saltar da cadeira mas sim para provocar medo e transportar o espectador para o mundo que a pouco e pouco vai criando e que leva o filme a terminar de uma forma extremamente atmosf rica que s nos d vontade de ver uma sequela quando o filme acaba
5751994 conta a hist ria de um grupo de jovens que se come am a suicidar depois de passarem in meras horas obcecados com um misterioso website que encontram na internet
5751995 apesar de conter uma atmosfera bem semelhante em alguns momentos mais um filme sobre a morte enquanto dimens o paralela do que pr priamente ter algo a ver com um filme do romero

5752045 the idea is that renan directly comes to valencia but we are discussing this question with the cbf brazilian fa who have to liberate the player
5752046 its just a question of time he is glad and signing for valencia is very important to him besides this happens at a good moment as he has been a starter in brazils olympic team
5752047 with rookies likely to fill four and possibly even five places on the team i believe nick faldo will be looking at experienced players for his two picks

5752058 it means the world to me to retain the armband
5752059 it was a little bit of a surprise because of the form rio has shown for manchester united and what they have achieved over the last couple of seasons
5752060 i was standing next to rio when the coach announced it and he turned to me and shook my hand that shows the quality of the man
5752061 i think i showed to the manager what kind of captain i am at the end of last season he gave me a boost by giving me the armband against the united states when i scored and i am now delighted to have the chance of captaining a winning england team
5752062 johns big personality is why i chose him but rio is also important for the team which is why i made him vice captain

5752223 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5752224 that is john mccains prerogative he can run that kind of campaign and frankly thats how political campaigns have been run in recent years but i believe the american people are better than that i believe that this defining moment demands something more of us
5752225 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election but one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
5752226 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain when i look out at this audience i see people of different political views you are democrats and republicans and independents but you all served together and fought together and bled together under the same proud flag you did not serve a red america or a blue america you served the united states of america
5752227 so lets have a serious debate and lets debate our disagreements on the merits of policy not personal attacks and no matter how heated it gets or what kind of campaign he chooses to run i will honor senator mccains service just like i honor the service of every veteran in this room and every american who has worn the uniform of the united states

5752235 gary glitter is a persistent offender responsible for a catalogue of sexual crimes against children

5752441 the first and most important key on email archiving is to understand that you need one however since it administrators in smes are often overworked and required to do tasks that an administrator in a large business would never dream of doing it comes as no surprise that many that do rely on end users to manage it themselves this can cause even bigger problems as human error is probably the most critical security vulnerability facing storage environments in small and medium sized enterprises

5752462 direi algumas palavras sobre as expectativas inflacion rias que muitos economistas v m como fundamental para a din mica da infla o h entretanto muito que n o entendemos sobre elas sua determina o e suas implica es vou dividir minha an lise em tr s t picos primeiro necessitamos entender melhor quais os fatores que determinam as expectativas inflacion rias da sociedade tal como discuti com mais detalhes em uma conversa no national bureau of economic research transcorrida no ltimo ver o 10 07 2007 ainda que existam muitas evid ncias que as expectativas t m se tornado mais bem ancoradas do que h algumas d cadas elas permanecem imperfeitamente ancoradas seria de bastante proveito para os pr prios formuladores da pol tica monet ria que conhecessem mais acerca de como as expectativas inflacion rias s o influenciadas por ela mesma pela sua comunica o e por outros fatores econ micos tais como os choques nos pre os de petr leo a crescente literatura sobre o aprendizado em modelos macroecon micos parece ser um ve culo til para abordar muitos desses t picos no modelo tradicional com expectativas racionais estrutura econ mica fixa e objetivos pol ticos est veis n o h papel para aquele aprendizado por parte da sociedade nele existe normalmente uma nica taxa de infla o de equil brio no longo prazo que perfeitamente antecipada a sociedade n o realiza infer ncias a partir das comunica es ou das a es dos banqueiros centrais o fato por m que a sociedade tem apenas informa es incompletas tanto acerca da economia quanto dos objetivos dos formuladores da pol tica fatores que podem ali s mudar ao longo do tempo considerar a possibilidade de aprendizado por parte da sociedade mais realista e ademais tende a gerar conclus es mais razo veis a respeito de como as expectativas inflacion rias mudam e em particular de como elas podem ser influenciadas pela a o e pronunciamentos da pol tica monet ria humildade faz falta para o nosso banco central a segunda categoria de quest es envolve os canais por meio dos quais as expectativas inflacion rias afetam a infla o presente a via fundamental a das expectativas para as negocia es salariais ou h outros mecanismos relevantes um achado algo perturbador sobre este problema foi revelado por uma pesquisa entre empres rios acerca de decis es de como eles formam seus pre os conduzida por blinder e outros asking about prices n y 1998 apenas uma pequena parcela dos entrevistados afirmou que a infla o agregada esperada afetava seus pre os como podemos conciliar esse resultado com nosso forte pressuposto de que as expectativas s o centrais para explicar a infla o talvez as expectativas afetem a infla o presente por meio de algum canal que seja relativamente indireto a crescente literatura sobre fixa o desagregada de pre os talvez possa lan ar alguma luz nessa quest o finalmente um grande conjunto de quest es gira em torno de como o banco central pode monitorar da melhor maneira poss vel as expectativas inflacion rias do p blico existem muitas medidas de infla o esperada incluindo expectativas colhidas junto a pesquisas em domic lios previs es de economistas profissionais e informa o extra da de mercados de ativos indexados infla o infelizmente as informa es sobre as expectativas dos pr prios formadores de pre o s o muito limitadas especialmente a dos empres rios qual das expectativas desses agentes a mais importante para a din mica inflacion ria e como os banqueiros centrais podem extrair melhor a informa o relevante a partir das v rias medidas dispon veis
5752463 the white house isnt a place to learn how to deal with international crisis the balance of power
5752464 joe biden sees the presidency as a pulpit from which america sets an example for the world the ads narrator said 20 years ago
5752465 he belives that developing nations once saw america as more than a place they saw us as a kind of people
5752466 he loves the attention he receives at the ceremony and takes his time inspecting the troops
5752467 the candidates want to stoke the speculation with nods hints and winks to get as much visibility as they can for the ultimate announcement
5752468 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the fox news sunday
5752469 if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else
5752470 its highly unlikely any of those choices are going to decisively impact the election
5752471 chinese girls are willing to work harder and eat more bitterness than the boys
5752472 its an eyesore i dont believe were going to find anyone to tackle that jail
5752473 put it out there and see what bites you get we have the right to refuse an offer
5752474 yeah it sounds fine i mean its a shame the mics arent in the audience cos it doesnt sound like youre getting many laughs oh and david odoherty says that line when a mobile goes off
5752475 i dont have enough material left to do another show next year
5752476 they did ask us to remix wonderwall when that first came out but basically we didnt know how to do it
5752477 yeah that would have been good to do it was a fairly big song
5752478 when noels name comes through on your phone the command has been issued it was exciting to do it and im glad they like it
5752479 we chucked loads of bits out and did it how we would want it to sound
5752480 there is no deal with the president and he had himself resigned
5752481 the coalition will now have to apply themselves because they will have no excuse
5752482 we are living at a moment in which the massive outward migration of the affluent that characterized the second half of the 20th century is coming to an end
5752483 changing mores of the young and by soaring gasoline prices
5752484 my perception of the value of privacy has changed if you know your neighbors them knowing when youre supposed to be home and not supposed to be home is ok
5752485 laat me gaan laat me gaan geef me ruimte om te leven
5752486 if god created everything then god created evil and since evil exists and according to the principal that our works define who we are then we can assume god is evil
5752487 what kind of question is this of course it exists have you never been cold
5752488 in fact sir cold does not exist according to the laws of physics what we consider cold is in reality the absence of heat every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy absolute zero 460 f is the total absence of heat and all matter becomes inert and incapable of reaction at that temperature cold does not exist we have created this word to describe how we feel if we have no heat
5752489 once again you are wrong sir darkness does not exist either darkness is in reality the absence of light light we can study but not darkness in fact we can use newtons prism to break white light into many colors and study the various wavelengths of each color you cannot measure darkness a simple ray of light can break into a world of darkness and illuminate it how can you know how dark a certain space is you measure the amount of light present isnt this correct darkness is a term used by man to describe what happens when there is no light present
5752490 of course as i have already said we see it everyday it is in the daily examples of mans inhumanity to man it is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world these manifestations are nothing else but evil
5752491 evil does not exist sir or at least it does not exist unto itself evil is simply the absence of god
5752492 ohh godll forgive me for what im gonna do tonight its not that bad
5752493 im going to have cute boobs till im 90 so theres that ill have the best boobs in the nursing home ill be the envy of all the ladies around the bridge table

5752499 this problem has been further compounded by the lack of software infrastructure necessary to centrally compile data for radiology departments that have multiple digital capture devices
5752500 our results suggest that complete and accurate reject analysis in digital radiography is possible but it requires that quality assurance software tools and associated network infrastructure be combined with rigorous data entry protocols to ensure the integrity of the analysis
5752501 positioning errors and anatomy cutoff were the most frequently occurring reasons for rejection accounting for 45 of rejects at the community hospital and 56 at the university
5752502 comprehensive digital radiography qa requires that a mechanism be put into place to force technologists to enter reject data information into a database preferably before another image can be scanned
5752503 standardized terminology and definitions for qa deficiencies must be established along with the associated training to eliminate inconsistent and inappropriate labeling of rejected images
5752504 these tools facilitate access to the objective data necessary to analyze and report on reject statistics and digital radiography equipment utilization across an entire institution

5752539 she was a good student well liked by her peers and teachers
5752540 our thoughts and prayers are with the dunlap family at this time
5752541 she was very sweet extremely talented probably more than she ever knew
5752542 i feel awful for her family to have to go through such a loss because she was such a good kid
5752543 she was an amazing soccer player and could always make anyone laugh
5752544 madison was never afraid to be crazy and fun and im really going to miss her
5752545 its not you its us the problems company wide and were trying to fix it as fast as we can
5752546 no no theyre not just starting theyre working on it now im sure itll be finished this afternoon
5752547 a burnt offering of a motor home is surely worth one computer
5752548 barrack obama is a bi racial senator from illinois running for president
5752549 yes sure as long as you make it clear that this poem is not meant to be serious
5752550 dad every home i can see into has the olympics on
5752551 deep economy the wealth of communities and the durable future
5752552 i really felt that the child study team listened to what i had to say and respected my position but we just cant seem to reach an agreement and we need a judge to resolve this
5752553 the child study team refuses to listen to me even though the law says that im a member of the individualized education program team 1 they have absolutely no respect for any of my concerns about my child

5752555 quando sono arrivati i soccorritori hanno trovato una spiaggia deserta
5752556 what if this story featured a romantic interest for the doctor
5752557 at the end of the day i would say the only way the consumer jumps in is if its subsidized
5752558 wed have to see a price point of somewhere around 200 to really show that theyre rim going after the apple market the iphone market or at least be more in the same ballpark
5752559 ouch and here i was still hoping that it would come in at 299 like the 16 gig iphone 3g silly me
5752560 it really comes down to what you need more in a phone while the bold certainly has improved media and other consumer features it really is a business device at the end of the day
5752561 the iphone 3g is a consumer device that happens to play nice with a lot of corporations and we honestly think you wont find many people dropping their blackberrys for an iphone theyll carry both as long as they can afford it
5752562 so some enterprise user who is very internet centric would certainly want to take advantage of the bold on the other hand somebody who may use it more for email applications for the most part the appeal isnt there
5752563 we believe investors should see rims growth outperforming peers in 08
5752564 only a half to a third of the medication was actually absorbed
5752565 the best thing would be to take your medication with water two hours before consuming fruit juices to prevent or reduce the chance of this drug interaction
5752566 i think that this is the tip of the iceberg
5752567 i think that there may be many other types of foods that could also possibly cause an interaction
5752568 to be able to fight my way back to the podium that was hard that was so hard this was a harder race than sydney was
5752569 i just felt like i was in the zone out there today everything went the way i wanted it to
5752570 i think the home crowd advantage gave the chinese gold medal winner a bit of a boost and that was enough to bump jason down into second place but to me he did the best routine today
5752571 i still cant believe it this silver medal is worth gold for me especially with the year i had
5752572 i kind of battled my way back i thought i had the momentum so i may as well try and put it away and if they want to beat me they were going to have to dig deep
5752573 i didnt know how to react i was kind of just standing there in a bit of daze thinking i cant believe this just happened
5752574 and to win the silver medal and like i said to represent canada was thrilling for me
5752575 the course was just spectacular it was a very very difficult course it was very hot and it was a hilly tight course but a particularly hilly run course so coming up that hill especially the fourth time the depth of your fitness really shows
5752576 to come back and to battle back a couple of times and to have just the wonderful preparation the wonderful team we have to all come together like that it was just spectacular
5752577 you are not pretty enough smart enough out going enough
5752578 you are too quiet you are too loud stop being you

5752587 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
5752588 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
5752589 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
5752590 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
5752591 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

5752601 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
5752602 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
5752603 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law

5752642 obamas shifting stance on space exploration is indicative of his inexperience on issues important to voters
5752643 lets be honest obama is only embracing nasa now because of his political problems in florida
5752644 something that is elemental and a vital part of our space program
5752645 i think weve got to sort out our priorities better in other words we cant do everything
5752646 to maintain a robust program of human space exploration and continue our nations pre eminence in space
5752647 considering obamas shifting positions he cannot be trusted to fully support nasas mission to mars
5752648 the only thing barack obama knows about sending a man to the moon is that its a good applause line
5752649 they realized that something needed to be done for these brave individuals beyond the brass bands and ticker tape parades they wanted to provide tangible support for the severely wounded to help them on the road to heal both physically and mentally
5752650 many of these men and women have been physically active throughout their lives soldier ride offers these brave individuals the chance to get on a bike and prove to themselves i can still do this soldier ride is not about politics its not about the war its simply about the soldiers
5752651 we are putting together a welcoming ceremony and dedication to see them off on their lake havasu city ride
5752652 we want these heroes to know lake havasu city supports them and truly thanks them for their sacrifice
5752653 what more of a lasting impression can we make on these men and women who gave so much of themselves for our country than by immortalizing them in this memorial to those who serve in our armed forces
5752654 wed like to present the soldiers with their bricks and have them lay them in the memorial walkway during the ceremony
5752655 we want everyone from the community to come out and show their support
5752656 both at the ceremony and after cheering them on as they ride along the route what an amazing way to really show our support for these heroes
5752657 there are a lot of people and organizations helping us out with this
5752658 the freedom bridge committee is really stepping up the school district has also pledged their support the lake havasu citizens police academy alumni association is taking part and so are many of the veterans groups the hampton inn is hosting the riders and the london bridge resort is helping with the dedication ceremony on wednesday morning the police department is helping set up the course and plan the event as well a lot of people are making this happen and it would be great to have as many residents as possible out there wednesday morning
5752659 one hundred percent of that will go to the wounded warrior project to help with their mission
5752660 if this helps me know more about market prices and find more dealers to sell to it wont take me more than a few days to make back the money i am spending
5752661 and computer penetration is practically zero this is a totally new market to be explored
5752662 they are still at the investment and ground laying stage
5752663 in cities people consume at home and produce at the office so you have two different it markets
5752664 farmers are not just consumers and if you treat them like urban consumers you miss something they are willing to spend money to increase their production
5752665 the ability of lenovos countryside strategy to open up and enter deep into new markets also depends heavily upon support from local governments at all levels
5752666 we hope local governments will improve the it infrastructure and help find the right providers of agricultural information
5752667 if they can do that we can bring pcs to the villages and people will see the benefits
5752668 they are expanding into the countryside very fast and we will work with the telecom operators
5752669 it looks easy enough to use but im afraid id break it
5752670 among other uses this will make possible great advances in telemedicine which will bring high quality medical treatment to remote areas and in distance education connecting students and teachers separated by great distances
5752671 costs depend on the context of the community radio station you are trying to build
5752672 we are pleased to welcome tim back to thunder bay where he started his extensive municipal career

5752683 the best thing would be to take your medication with water two hours before consuming fruit juices to prevent or reduce the chance of this drug interaction
5752684 i think that this is the tip of the iceberg
5752685 i think that there may be many other types of foods that could also possibly cause an interaction
5752686 the nomadic life has become so difficult and there are so many rules and regulations which have become a noose around us

5752737 corsis approach to politics is both destructive and self destructive

5752746 vous ne pouvez pas leur dire a na pas de sens vous devez respecter a

5752751 when we started my dad would be up at 4 a m on the mornings i had 5 30 practice
5752752 it was like a storybook marriage but sometimes chapters go in different directions
5752753 he said he didnt want me to go to barcelona because i hadnt been around this is his world and im just watching him travel through it people ask me how hes doing where hes swimming next and its hard to say that i dont know
5752754 well throw e mails back and forth every now and then
5752755 this is his glory his time to shine and i want him to get everything he wants
5752756 im just on pins and needles every time michael hits the water
5752757 this was a case that impacted the entire community and it was a fund set up for the kids
5752758 it is important that we bring closure to that part of it because there are a lot of people that are affected and hurting because of this

5752761 martin jol hat gro es interesse an unserer arbeit gezeigt
5752762 its very significant to us because its usually a large portion of our work
5752763 probably the single largest segment of non oak ridge work there is
5752764 even the ability to communicate images into the operating room if you go back years ago you didnt see that
5752765 more and more people are moving to our area from the north and the northeast and in retirement
5752766 honestly those are the people who use hospitals its usually not much young people its people who are older and retired
5752767 most of these developments are approaching 20 years in age and most of these are long term residents they are members of the community and neighborhood stability affects everything we do
5752768 if we dont do anything then were definitely going to lose those units
5752769 a lot of these buildings are in gentrifying communities they are important in that they provide affordable housing and they keep these communities diverse
5752770 otherwise were looking at neighborhoods only for the rich and wealthy
5752771 when you lose project based housing that results in a net loss of affordable housing for the community
5752772 that subsidy ends at a cliff and theres nothing for the tenants
5752773 a deals a deal if they want to come back to me to negotiate a fair means to make a living and a profit then ill stay in
5752774 we want to make sure that those are the first ones saved

5752782 took our eye off the real enemy osama bin laden
5752783 john mccain would know far more than we would about what a total 180 looks like
5752784 one of the pieces of the puzzle that bring us victory
5752785 we are going to look up one night and see this 100 billion space station going by with no americans on it
5752786 that just makes me shudder the only way that you cannot have a gap is to continue to fly our existing system and that is the shuttle
5752787 i intend to set our priorities at nasa and to make sure existing programs are scrutinized and make sure theyre most effective
5752788 but space is still the last frontier i believe the american people will support it
5752789 weve had a lot of our poll workers sign up and complete the course but were always excited to see new faces who are interested in learning more about the election process
5752790 for every class there has been two or three who have been interested in working at the polls
5752791 the goal is not just to have poll workers but poll workers who have a working knowledge of election law
5752792 this course will go a long way toward reaching that goal
5752793 it makes a big difference in understanding why we do what we do
5752794 just like many organizations in our community the board of elections has benefited from civic minded senior citizens willing to give of their time to work the polls years after year
5752795 were hoping that other age groups will follow this example and work with us in upcoming elections
5752796 little johnny would just fight me i tried to teach him once and he just fought with me he does much better with the teacher
5752797 r e a c h f o r h e a l i n g through therapeutic movement
5752798 theres been a great response already to the letter but frankly every senator should sign on because its irrational to say no to proven american energy during this energy crisis
5752799 youre going to see a lot of people talk about the possibility of a shutdown but as to how far it goes it depends a lot on things you cant predict right now
5752800 its pretty clear and explicit that they havent gotten to the end of the game here that theyre not saying if the drilling ban extension is in the budget resolution that theyre going to shut down the government
5752801 republicans dont want to shut the government down they want to open up american energy so we can lower the price of gas at the pump
5752802 if republicans want to threaten to shut down the government in order to push policies such as offshore drilling that wont help until the year 2030 then they should go right ahead
5752803 the entire republican party will pay a terrible price in the elections in november for such a silly and desperate stunt
5752804 it becomes a struggle from them they get to the store and theyre out of the box
5752805 we had them on order for the entire month of july
5752806 its just going to get worse later in the year

5752813 ill go ahead and get the court order i want the placenta i should have it its part of the baby and i want to do this
5752814 what is this policy and why are you continuing to deny women their placenta

5752820 the tunnelers relied on the strength of their arms on their skill with a sledgehammer and a crowbar and were aided with gunpowder for blasting
5752821 gibraltars had very important guns that have formed part of its history finding out the story behind each of these guns is a history lesson in itself

5752830 surely then the real aggression in yugoslavia began with the western recognition of slovenia and croatia the territorial integrity of a state yugoslavia that was voluntarily created and which had existed since december 1918 was swept aside in 1991 new state recognition policy proved to be an inventive method of destroying long standing sovereign independent states when several rich and powerful states decide to take a sovereign independent state apart through the policy of recognition how is this state supposed to defend itself there can be no deterrence or defense against this form of destruction

5752837 you always have dreams that you cross the line first but they rarely become reality i just ran across the line thinking i won

5752894 het lijkt erop dat in vele gevallen de belangrijkste reden voor de verliezen van de banken in de kredietcrisis het onvermogen was om risicomanagement en interne controlesystemen met elkaar in verband te brengen en op elkaar af te stemmen essenti le schakels ontbreken vaak in de drie eenheid risk governance and control
5752895 het juist de interne beheersingssystemen die steeds meer bepalen wie de winnaars en de verliezers zijn in de mondiale financi le sector

5752906 depaoli thank you for taking my question this was a great year for the pirates in terms of acquiring talent for the future via trades and a splendid draft class i would have liked to have seen one or two more guys signed such as zachary wilson drew gagnon tanner scheppers or that palmerio kid great blood lines that being said i guess we cant be too greedy however what i am somewhat worried about is next season by the time things are said and done that bucs will have one of the top draft picks once again and i worry that this year was just a splash in the pan honestly nothing has given us the impression that it will be but i just want to see them continue on this path what do you think and will the pirates draft for need next year such as middle infield or catcher or do they go with the best talent available regardless of where that prospect plays
5752907 for basically three decades sports drinks were growing at a pace that no one knew how large the category truly was
5752908 it still does not appear to have maxed out by any stretch however growth has slowed due to proliferation in the broader non carb category

5752922 the windows engineering team proper is jointly managed by jon and me jon manages the core operating system which is among many things the kernel device infrastructure networking and the engineering tools and system all of which are both client and server i am part of the windows client experience team which develops among many things the shell and desktop graphics and media support
5752923 windows 7s feature teams sound a lot like parts of windows with which you are familiar
5752924 because of the platform elements of windows we have many teams that have remained fairly constant over several releases whereas some teams are brand new or represent relatively new areas composed of some new code and the code that formed the basis of the team some teams do lots of work for server such as the vm work and some might have big deliverables outside of windows 7 such as internet explorer
5752925 some of the main feature teams for windows 7 include alphabetically applets and gadgets assistance and support technologies core user experience customer engineering and telemetry deployment and component platform desktop graphics devices and media devices and storage documents and printing engineering system and tools file system find and organize fundamentals internet explorer including ie 8 down level international kernel amp vm media center networking core networking enterprise networking wireless security user interface platform and windows app platform
5752926 it takes a set of people to build windows and it is a big project the way that i look at this is that our job is to have the windows team be the right size that sounds clich but what i mean by that is that the team is neither too large nor too small but is effectively managed so that the work of the team reflects the size of the team and you see the project as having the benefits we articulate
5752927 adequate margin of safety exists for bpa at current levels of exposure from food contact uses

5752929 fda has determined the appropriate no observed adverse effect level noael for its assessment of bpa to be the noael for systemic toxicity of 5 mg kg bw day 5000 g kg bw day derived from two multigenerational rodent studies
5752930 despite more than 100 published studies by government scientists and university laboratories that have raised health concerns about a chemical compound that is central to the multibillion dollar plastics industry the food and drug administration has deemed it safe largely because of two studies both funded by an industry trade group
5752931 the fact that industry generated data to support the safety i dont think is an unusual thing
5752932 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health
5752933 for this to come out on a friday afternoon just before california takes action it definitely raises some eyebrows
5752934 the fda cannot be trusted interference with and suppression of credible science information to the public for the benefit of large corporate interests is what our current federal government is all about
5752935 shoppers are clearly taking advantage of the short term price cuts and promotional deals that all of the major supermarkets have been running to help keep spending within their family budgets

5752994 by pioneering new business models the pc has quietly remained the single leading platform for games not only in terms of consumer usage but revenue generation
5752995 the most fascinating thing about pc gaming is its ability to attract such a diverse audience both demographically and geographically the real key has been the rapid growth in penetration of broadband connected pcs in all markets around the world broadband connected pcs are the key driver of growth for pc gaming dfc intelligence estimated that by the end of 2007 less than one third of households in the top 20 markets for games had a high speed internet connection that clearly indicates that there is still plenty of growth to come the initiatives of the pcga will be a key enabler of growth as they will help the industry identify key trends and opportunities in this rapidly emerging market

5753006 we believe its essential for all nato countries to stay the course so that we accomplish our objectives of creating a stable environment in afghanistan that is not a threat either to its people or people elsewhere in the world

5753051 f r eine durch die bestimmungsgem e ingebrauchnahme der sache entstandene verschlechterung m ssen sie keinen wertersatz leisten

5753055 indessen enthalten die 355 ff bgb nur allgemeine vorschriften f r alle gesetze nach denen dem verbraucher ein widerrufsrecht einger umt ist speziell f r den fernabsatz ist in 312 c bgb n her festgelegt zu welchem zeitpunkt und in welcher form die widerrufsbelehrung mit dem in 1 abs 1 nr 10 bgb infov niedergelegten inhalt zu erfolgen hat die erf llung der informationspflichten nach 312 c abs 2 bgb hat in textform zu erfolgen und zwar bei waren darum geht es hier sp testens bis zur lieferung an den verbraucher 312 c abs 2 s 1 nr 2 bgb diese regelungen zur widerrufsbelehrung im fernabsatz sind als spezialregelungen zum zeitpunkt und zur art und weise der belehrung ber die rechtsfolgen des widerrufs anzusehen und gehen in ihrem anwendungsbereich 357 abs 3 s 1 bgb vor somit kann der antragsgegner sich die haftung des k ufers f r verschlechterungen in der weise erhalten dass er innerhalb der online auktion entsprechend der anlage 2 zu 14 bgb infov ber die rechtsfolgen des widerrufs informiert sofern er noch sp testens bis zur lieferung der ware dem verbraucher die widerrufsbelehrung in textform zukommen l sst
5753056 es handelt sich bei den vorschriften welche die belehrung des verbrauchers ber widerrufsrechte regeln um marktverhaltensregelungen zum schutze der verbraucher weshalb eine unterbliebene falsche oder unzureichende belehrung nach 4 nr 11 uwg unlauter ist letztlich geht es ja auch nicht um einen versto gegen 357 abs 3 satz 1 bgb sondern um einen solchen gegen 312c abs 1 bgb i v m 1 abs 1 nr 10 bgb infov f hrt die regelung des 357 abs 3 satz 1 bgb dazu dass die belehrung ber die wertersatzpflicht als teil der von 1 abs 1 nr 10 bgb infov geforderten belehrung ber die rechtsfolgen des widerrufs hier die wertersatzpflicht bei verschlechterung der sache falsch oder irref hrend bzw nicht transparent i s v 312 abs 1 satz 1 bgb ist liegt eine unzureichende und damit wettbewerbswidrige belehrung vor

5753080 we get together for dinner or whatever whenever were in the same city
5753081 having been through this eight years ago and to be able to fight my way back onto the podium that was hard that was so hard
5753082 i wanted to discourage him and put it out there that if youre going to beat me youre going to hurt way more
5753083 jan just went and the way he went he was just going anyway he would have done it with 20 metres to go or from there so i made him make a decision early
5753084 i could see him on my inside there and i gave it one more crack just to see if i could break him but then you just start tying up and that hurt a lot
5753085 canadians want medals and i got called arrogant and i got called cocky and i thought wait a minute

5753100 if you are producing in europe and transferring your products to the us then you have a huge cost disadvantage
5753101 they both followed the wrong strategy of focusing on volume growth rather than price increases but they are now both changing clariant introduced this strategy six or 12 months before ciba allowing them to increase prices six per cent in the second quarter
5753102 the climate is now very good for price increases because customers know that raw material prices are increasing
5753103 market share is not a key point but to maintain profitability in the near future clariant is in a healthier position it has more strategic options and a stronger balance sheet to reposition itself in the market
5753104 we now believe that an unidentified male rented a room from the couple on or about august 1 this year
5753105 mr yang informed his mother that the new lodger was a student and that he came from the jinzhou area of the northern seaport city dalian
5753106 we have no further information to identify the lodger and enquiries to trace him have so far failed
5753107 we urgently need to identify this unknown lodger who could have vital information to assist the murder investigation and to eliminate him from our enquiries
5753108 enquiries are continuing into allegations of internet betting scams and the obtaining of fraudulent university qualifications however our enquiries thus far do not reveal the couples involvement in major criminality and their lifestyle and finances are not what could be expected of anyone involved in organised crime
5753109 the levels of violence used in the killings is completely disproportionate to the level of minor fraudulent activity discovered on the couples computer thus far
5753110 we must not lose sight of the fact that xi zhou and zhen xing yang are victims of a senseless killing and their parents and friends are left devastated and unable to comprehend what has happened
5753111 we know little of who this lodger was we do not know whether he had yet moved in and whether he lived there at the time of the killings
5753112 none of his personal possessions were found in the flat
5753113 the sequence of events we have is that xi zhou and zhen xing yang who was known as kevin had advertised the flat on the internet and we have spoken to one witness who responded to the advert and went to view the flat at the end of july
5753114 she reached an initial agreement with kevin to rent the room then within a few hours had second thoughts about the length of the tenancy and told him she did not wish to take up the offer
5753115 she was then given three days to vacate her current address so at the end of august she rang kevin to ask whether the room was still up for rent
5753116 he telephoned his mother in china on august 4 to say hed rented out the room to a student from dalian
5753117 the trouble we have now is that we do not know whether the lodger was a real lodger who that person is or whether they were ever in the address
5753118 if they have moved in then they may know things about the victims lifestyles arguments they may have had or visitors to the flat
5753119 it is very important that we speak to this man
5753120 as to potential motives for the killings some people may wrongly have assumed that they brought it on themselves and that may be stopping people from coming forward
5753121 but they were not involved in high level stuff there was no printing press for forged documents no racketeering
5753122 they did not have a jet set lifestyle were living in a small flat in the west end of newcastle involved in low level stuff which does not point towards justifying why these murders have happened
5753123 but it would not have been difficult for anyone looking at the website to see here was a young couple living in newcastle who may have been worth a few pounds
5753124 or whether or not the government needs a new mandate
5753125 we did establish a fixed date for the next election that said in this minority parliament two of the parties the bloc quebecois and the ndp have indicated for some months now that they want an election immediately
5753126 liberal leader stephane dion has indicated that the government should be defeated but hes not sure when hell do that because he doesnt have good enough polls i dont think thats a particularly responsible position
5753127 fixed election date idea more before he put it in
5753128 jons expert knowledge of the industry and impressive ability to expand and grow our business organically make him a terrific asset to mv
5753129 i remain in awe of his talents and enthusiastically await what the future holds for mv with jon as its chairman
5753130 the chinese knew that according to olympics bylaws they are required to provide a synagogue and kosher food and they knew there would be a rabbi but since judaism is not one of the religions recognized by the chinese they didnt really know how to operate
5753131 only after i made it clear to them that i understood my appointment was not an official government appointment did the chinese agree to meet with me
5753132 the understanding respect and consideration they have displayed has been above and beyond there are no words to describe how grateful i am

5753143 in early may 2003 a sensitive source gave coalition forces a box of chemicals he claimed the iis m16 preparation division was researching the chemicals were meant for assassinations or to assist in kidnapping
5753144 we havent made that label in at least 20 years
5753145 clearly this local business owner simply wanted to support the american security pacs goals which are to help support congressional candidates who believe in a strong national defense
5753146 but i have never spoken to him about the pending bill or about compound 1080
5753147 like thousands of other bills that have not been debated congressman rogers has not reviewed or taken a position on this legislation or acted in any official capacity to address the issue
5753148 i am shocked to know that anyone would accept money from a company that continues to make a product that is so dangerous

5753165 moftware will bring otterbox business to india and open up exciting opportunities worldwide its a very new market and there is lots of potential for expansion
5753166 for us this is beyond just a great opportunity for expansion we know that otterbox products are truly unique so adding them to our offerings on the fommy co in website for the indian consumer was an easy decision
5753167 since our recent partnership our presence here in the us continues to expand through moftwares many domestic retail and distribution channels
5753168 we are eager to work with moftware to explore the potential that otterbox has in these new markets
5753169 moftware is our largest customer and primary distributor in india through fommy com and fommy co in otterbox will definitely have a more international scope
5753170 i feel theyre still our heroes even if they lose
5753171 it is an honor to play in this olympics tournament
5753172 we get an entry because china is a host i think we look at this as a chance to practice and this as a learning opportunity most of the chinese players are very young and they do not have the experiences of the international tournaments
5753173 but it is difficult because the game of water polo is not very popular here
5753174 we still have a chance to win in the second round
5753175 we have lost enough times already we should have a win

5753193 we would like to thank those people living near the scene and the wider alton community who have shown tremendous spirit in offering shelter and comfort to all those involved
5753194 many rallied round last night to help those affected by the crash and gave support to residents evacuated from their homes most of whom will not be returning until the coach is removed the community pulled together and at one stage the village hall was opened to provide shelter
5753195 throughout last night and today great support has been shown to assist police and other emergency services and we would like to thank residents

5753203 the aca has discussed the situation with its executive and our position is we cant recommend to our players they should tour pakistan for the champions trophy
5753204 we feel for the pakistan cricket board and the people of pakistan but it is the job of the aca to make recommendations to our members based on whether it is safe to tour unfortunately in this case we dont believe it is safe
5753205 we have not heard anything officially from cricket australia and until we do we are not in a position to make any comment
5753206 what we have done is to very clearly outline to each of these stakeholders the plan that we have in place for the champions trophy in pakistan
5753207 understandably there are safety concerns and thats what we are engaged in and we are dealing with
5753208 the ecb has received a briefing from us and have gone into a board meeting they will consider our briefing among other reports that they may have on whether they will participate or not but that is a decision for the ecb as far as the icc are concerned the safety and security is satisfactory for hosting the tournament in pakistan
5753209 its something i would not be able to tell you at this point
5753210 i wouldnt be able to tell you what would be in the minds of the icc board when it sits to consider such an eventuality it would be great for the best teams to attend and every one of the best players to come
5753211 i think weve got to a position where its very difficult to do it to the position where we could stage a successful world class event
5753212 at this point in time there is no discussion about a late move it is speculative until member boards or teams clearly indicate what their view is as far as we are concerned the tournament continues in pakistan
5753213 every single day our security advisors update themselves and in turn us on the changing political environment in pakistan the advice on the current development is that the status quo remains unchanged if anything it is a step in the right direction and im quoting their words

5753222 the idea is that renan directly comes to valencia but we are discussing this question with the cbf brazilian fa who have to liberate the player
5753223 its just a question of time he is glad and signing for valencia is very important to him besides this happens at a good moment as he has been a starter in brazils olympic team
5753224 i would just point out that mr chretien almost never attended olympics when he was prime minister for 13 years
5753225 as you know i havent attended olympics in the past and i indicated a long time ago i had no intention of attending this one

5753247 i dont see anything in the statement that says there will be a half per cent cut
5753248 we will assess it if the rba makes that decision and we will just look at where we are
5753249 like the rest of them banks we have also incurred additional costs and we have had to pass some of them on
5753250 we certainly welcome that news and would even say rate rises had gone too far too quickly
5753251 they may have over cooked it last time so hopefully they can undo the damage
5753252 i think there will be a cut next month of 0 25 of a per cent and probably another one in november
5753253 and i think probably there will be another three rate reductions next year

5753314 we willen nagaan of er mogelijkheden zijn zonder het centrum teveel te belasten want de nieuwe opzet kan leiden tot veel overlast je moet ook een goed alternatief bieden voor de warenmarkt die gewoonlijk uitwijkt naar de parade
5753315 om te beginnen heb je weinig van deze attracties bovendien komen ze pas echt goed tot hun recht op een aparte locatie je kunt denken aan het burgemeester loeffplein en het kerkplein maar daar is te weinig ruimte
5753316 its not how that customer fits into brand x its about how brand x fits into that customers life
5753317 mostly white mostly christian and red state all the way
5753318 all we have to do is figure out who we are and where were heading in life
5753319 because of the complexity of the transaction in the sense of the different regulatory environments its taking longer than expected for us to make an announcement
5753320 but hopefully this chapter will come to an end in the next four to six weeks either way whether positively or negatively
5753321 we are not in the business obviously of merging or buying a commercial bank at three four or five times book value and 20 times earnings we would be sellers at these valuations
5753322 so i think if the deal were not to happen we would be faced with one or two alternatives either we divest from bank audi and effectively give the cash to the shareholders and make an irr internal rate of return of 30 or 35 percent
5753323 or we maintain it for another day where maybe the integration of the two organizations becomes more achievable
5753324 our share of the six month earnings is about 11 million annualize that then you should look at more or less 50 pct of that
5753325 we are hoping this is a platform for ultimately a greater presence in kuwait

5753328 strange you seem over pleased with yourself in just the exact amount as ever
5753329 only small ones and that damned jhonsons net almost overflowed with big fat fish glittering in the sun mocking my poor luck
5753330 you are being overly dramatic im sure youll have your luck tomorrow
5753331 i suppose you are right it just has been an awfully poor week
5753332 i see your point friend but i think youre over reacting so its a lousy week everyone has them
5753333 it is as if the whole world is trying to depress
5753334 he sat on a little barrel near the road he already missed his wife and meal a few more moments wont change a thing by now
5753335 then you shouldnt let it move on and forget about this one lousy week
5753336 sometimes i wish i could die and get myself some peace
5753337 maybe i could kill it while everyones asleep tell the little one he was hit by a cart
5753338 i suppose it will be polite to give you mine in exchange knowing my name can do no harm considering the fact that within minutes from now you will cease to exist
5753339 you are a prey and i was sent to kill you you may feel yourself honored that a head brunch son is here to kill you not many win this privilege so are you ready to die
5753340 now troublesome prey sit still and let me kill you
5753341 what do you want from me what have i done
5753342 you freak you monster what have you done with my family
5753343 your oh so precious lives with your family and friends
5753344 your lives are so short so meaningless what is there for you to cherish
5753345 thats enough hand me your life and be over with it
5753346 you humans are such miserable creatures with your short meaningless life the bloodshade family was once human until it had discovered the secret to everlasting life
5753347 you can with a special method take peoples lives and make them your own by that you extend your years by the number of years of an average mortal make it hundred of mortals make it thousands of them and you have all the life you could care to have
5753348 the bloodshade family keeps every generation living for hundreds of years but in order to do that we must kill
5753349 you poor mortal were chosen and i never give up on my preys

5753362 i spent the early summer in austria training in salzburg
5753363 red bull sent me over they have a hockey club and they just wanted me to come over and train and see how i liked it i gave it a shot and really liked it it did me a lot of good and im in great shape now
5753364 then i went to buffalo for the development camp i met up again with the guys i know from last years development camp im back home now in new jersey and training here for the rest of the summer
5753365 hes an offensive defenseman who flew onto the charts this year
5753366 he has to become like a lot of kids going from juniors to the professional game he thinks offense but you have to be capable defensively hopefully his skating agility and his defensive awareness will improve he needs to work on his pivoting his turning to skate backwards his first couple of steps anyone can skate a straight line todays game is about wiggling around making tight turns skating in a phone booth you have to be able to maneuver get a little space and throw a puck on net
5753367 i would take it as a compliment if they are grooming me to be the power play quarterback of the future but im not sure what they have in mind for me just yet
5753368 i do have a lot of confidence that they will develop me in the right way i will hold up my end and im confident they will too i know they are dedicated to making me the best i can be and ill do my half
5753369 that contract that brian campbell signed with chicago showed how great he is and how much he was wanted to be mentioned in the same category is great but i have a lot to work on hopefully one day ill be there i would love to fulfill the sabres plans for me
5753370 its going to be a shame having to move to montreal and not having the same family
5753371 i went out to newfoundland and had a great billet family that supported me so much i will always be grateful to trevor budgell and renee spurrell for what they did for me they just had a son in november jake i got really close to them we will keep in touch and they are coming to new jersey for a few weeks this summer
5753372 i was just turning 17 and it gave me a different route instead of college going to canada especially st johns that was really out there but that was what i wanted to do i will do whatever it takes to make it to the national hockey league and play for the buffalo sabres
5753373 the guys on the team were great we had a lot of local players so we got to learn a lot about newfoundland it was so great in st johns the people were unbelievable i did really well there away from hockey i finished my senior year in high school in my first season there after the season i was able to come back to moorestown and graduate with my class that worked out really well i took university courses last season a couple of business and economics classes
5753374 i do have a lot of confidence that they will develop me in the right way i will hold up my end and im confident they will too
5753375 im guessing im going to be playing another season of canadian major junior
5753376 under the rules my only options are to play in buffalo or verdun im going to give it my best shot to make the sabres more realistically ill play one more year of juniors my ultimate goal is to make it to the nhl so i want to play where it will do me the most good if i dont make the sabres this year nothing is going to stop me from training really hard and being dedicated to improving my game and my team if i fall short in september ill know what i have to work on and i will get better
5753377 i didnt start playing until i was 10 or 11 years old
5753378 i had some friends who were playing and i started with the jaguars first in voorhees and then in evesham i was born in willingboro and grew up in moorestown went to the moorestown schools
5753379 i played five or six years for the jaguars and my freshman and sophomore seasons for moorestown high school i then played my junior year in high school for the little flyers and coach wayne sands in aston pa they wouldnt let me play high school so i just focused on the little flyers
5753380 its great to see i love to see the kids in the middle schools who are coming after us i just want to see the sport grow here and i wish there were even more people getting into it
5753381 its good to see people at the higher levels in hockey taking us more seriously

5753408 generally a vendor sells an appliance to have a special purpose solution that is optimized to do a particular job sounds like falconstor has decided that its a better strategy to unbundle the software from the hardware and use off the shelf components plusses are you can use anyones hardware in theory minuses are configuration complexities potentially lower performance less ability to add special value
5753409 but if falconstor is getting out of the appliance business one has to ask why was the strategy failing

5753418 hiv infection of monocytes increases their capacity to cross even an intact bbb hiv infection in the gut releases lps into the bloodstream allowing it to erode the bbb and hiv infection of the cells of the bbb makes them more sensitive to the deleterious effects of lps
5753419 so we hypothesized that the combination of hiv infected monocytes and elevated lps levels would amplify the ability of hiv to cross the bbb and get into the brain
5753420 clearly hiv infected monocytes uniquely benefit from the lps that is present in high amounts in the blood of hiv infected people

5753438 as im sure you might know the hills season four is premiering tonight and you dont need to guess where ill be at 10 p m i know the characters didnt have much of a say in the naming of their show but the hills just doesnt seem appropriate anymore since their 30 minutes of air time is filled with a plethora of drama dont you think they deserve a more theatrical title
5753439 i bet youve got some sick viewing party planned complete with socal inspired cocktails and a spencer and heidi dartboard right
5753440 after a decidedly ho hum season 3 im finding it hard to muster up the same levels of excitement
5753441 ok maybe the second half of season 3 was a little lacklustre but from the buzz ive been hearing about lauren conrad amp co season 4 definitely has more promise with the ridiculously spoiled and inexplicably elite hollywood gang
5753442 id go so far as to guess even the people on the hills arent that into the hills anymore
5753443 oh come on everyone knows the hills is totally set up what are they calling it oh yeah scheduled reality and perhaps its getting difficult to relate to l c s everygirl problems when we know shes walking down a red carpet every other night but true hills fans dont care whether or not its real they just want to live vicariously through posh people
5753444 is lo as big of a bitch as they make her out to be
5753445 other exciting news it seems as if maybe heidi might be realizing spencer is really the biggest db ever
5753446 i knew i was going to do a live blog on my reactions to this season of the hills when i read the quote in last week s entertainment weekly where mtv exec toni disanto said it s almost becoming like a novel at this point like this generation s a tale of two cities or oliver twist proving that he s never read a dickens novel
5753447 i really wish this show would get a new theme song or at least reinvent this natasha bedingfield song this season it s so outdated

5753467 we feel that everything is in place squad wise player wise now we have to deliver
5753468 but the numbers that we have the youngsters coming through we are better off than we have ever been
5753469 we have senior players now reaching their peaks everything is in place but injuries are really damaging us
5753470 everything else has been painstakingly put together we just need those top players to be with us everyone gets injuries but not the amount we have constantly had to cope with
5753471 we have had the heart ripped out of our defence when we have been moving along in the right direction
5753472 we can now field an under 21 side that is not far short of 100 senior caps wales have never been able to do something like that in the past
5753473 we aim to get as much as we can out of this match the under 21 game is more important on the night but we start our world cup qualifiers next month so we need to make the most of every opportunity to play together
5753474 but we are missing five important players james collins danny gabbidon joe ledley craig bellamy and lewin nyatanga for this one and once again we are suffering major injury blows
5753475 even the biggest nations in the world would struggle if they kept losing half their best team game after game
5753476 collins though is back in training at west ham while bellamy is likely to be fit around the time we play azerbaijan in a fortnight in our first world cup qualifier collins may also be ready for that if what we hear is correct
5753477 we have maybe nine first choice players missing through injury or the under 21 requirements but we are still able to field a decent side
5753478 that would not have been possible when i took over we struggled to find enough players for the bench then but the strength in depth is there now we are a bit thin on the ground at the back for this one though
5753479 but under 21 coach brian flynn and myself have worked very closely right from day one on this and i do feel now that everything is in place but we have to be a lot more fortunate with injuries and withdrawals
5753480 if we continue like this it is going to make a difficult job even more difficult
5753481 for us this is our last friendly before the world cup games and we want to get some confidence from this one to take into the new qualifying campaign
5753482 the manager has been working towards this campaign since he took over he has always been talking about bringing in young players and now we have got to a stage where we have to deliver
5753483 we are all ready for this the talking stops now we have played together long enough

5753507 i talked to a clinton delegate here in maryland he told me they have been instructed to vote for hillary for president on the first ballot to make things more interesting there is a movement to swing 160 delegates from obama to clinton if that happens clinton could re establish her campaign and face john mccain in the fall
5753508 the group p u m a for public unity my a claims that 15 delegates have switched from obama to clinton in july there is still the possibility of a floor convention vote to fully seat the delegations from michigan and florida which would benefit senator clinton
5753509 the question is will it be an easy nomination for obama or one of the grandest political ambushes ever pulled off on the voting floor of the convention

5753515 look whos talking gloria arroyo started the mess in mindanao island she had already given up large vast of tracts of lands to milf in the so called memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain her treacherous act has unnecessarily put filipino soldiers and the police in harms way gloria arroyo is the problem its about time to kick her out
5753516 what i cannot stomach in the statement released by this antipatica gloria is i am with you in peace we are all in this together how can she say that teka muna she is not with us in peace she created this war to begin with and put us in this mess we are not all in this together
5753517 come to think of it if the milf is saying that the ones causing the recent bombings explosions etc in mindanao are not authorized by them then who is causing it only someone who is desperate to stay in power someone who wants to declare a state of emergency hmmmm who could that be

5753536 in the minds of most people you rarely spend money to get nothing done
5753537 but in government people often spend vast sums of money to make sure nothing happens at all
5753538 you put the dysfunctionality and the sharp partisan issues together and the failure to get a bill is easy to describe
5753539 but to say nothings happened because of this money i dont agree with that
5753540 maybe they know who their friends are and they have other means of influencing them

5753556 weve all read about the infamous it girls the young women whose time in the limelight is defined as much by their very public personal struggles as by their achievements and accolades
5753557 however the winners of the it girl essentials contest exemplify a whole new generation of women who are concerned active and effective in their communities and in their world
5753558 i am passionate about childrens rights and about bringing that message to all corners of the world
5753559 it is important for young women to be confident and realize how much they can affect the world if they put their mind to it
5753560 ortho womens health amp urology is dedicated to recognizing young confident reliable women who are leaders of their generation
5753561 the panel had a very difficult decision to make with hundreds of applications submitted many of these young women have accomplished so much already and most are not even 25 yet
5753562 traveling to a new country that youve never been to before is full of exciting adventures and challenges
5753563 ive been taking ortho tri cyclen lo for the past 3 years and with the instability of traveling its crucial for me that my birth control is reliable
5753564 as a doctor i am glad to see that these women are taking the time to be aware of their birth control options
5753565 with so much going on in their lives a reliable birth control pill that may provide more predictable periods as well as a low rate of breakthrough or unexpected bleeding is important women should talk with their healthcare professional about the best option for them
5753566 given soa enables loosely coupled approach to services and reuse what happens is when you interact with partners consumers and providers any exemptions you had about the control are about to change
5753567 most importantly trust in the environment changes dramatically so trust based identification and identity management is key
5753568 enterprise boundaries are expanding therefore managing trust becomes important applications are no longer within a firewall so in that context identities need to be trusted mediated and managed
5753569 in an soa environment identities are not limited to user alone but service themselves services start to have or need to take on identities themselves because services in a composite application environment one service may invoke another service a shipping service may be invoked by an order processing system so in this context services take on identities so the life cycle of services as well as users need to be taken into account when considering identity
5753570 theres greater focus on application and information assets because information such as medical records or financial information could potentially be exposed outside protection measures need to apply to manage and enforce the data whether its data in transit or data at rest
5753571 compliance needs to be a key driver that for the ability to know who accessed what and who has access to what and things like that to provide audit reports such as with compliance this is important in an soa environment the challenge is around these audit reports and logs are not the systems you control but it could be in other systems effort becomes more important
5753572 in the adoption of soa people are thinking about individual services how to reuse them but theyre moving to where its a model where multiple services could be composed to traditionally security measures that oriented towards a single application or a service but then we compose these multiple technology services into business services and policies need to be managed at a very high level and not just at technology like a web service level but holistic business service level the policy driven approach is going to become more important and theres lot more work to be done in this area

5753615 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
5753616 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
5753617 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
5753618 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
5753619 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
5753620 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
5753621 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
5753622 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
5753623 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
5753624 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed

5753626 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
5753627 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
5753628 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
5753629 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
5753630 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

5753718 we used to have this season from october to april where we had a chance for a storm
5753719 when you pull the storm track north it takes the storms with it
5753720 during the period its raining less it also tends to be warmer than it used to be
5753721 were starting to see the impacts of climate change in the late winter and early spring particularly in the southwest its a season specific kind of drought
5753722 were used to thinking about climate change as happening sometime in the future to someone else but this is right here and affects us now the future is here
5753723 its very rare that you get this distribution by chance
5753724 this is huge victory against one of the most egregious rollbacks of environmental protections in our nations history
5753725 as one of the first rollbacks of the bush administration this rule helped set a pattern of limiting the application of environmental laws to benefit polluters and denying the public the right know about pollution in their communities
5753726 public health should be a top priority not polluters profits todays decision will give states back the tools they need to hold polluters accountable and help ensure that everyone has clean healthy air to breathe
5753727 we are delighted that lonnie bunch will be joining us at the centennial
5753728 his presence demonstrates that our celebration in october has both national and statewide significance and it will highlight the importance of this historic place
5753729 lonnie bunch is a peerless pioneer in preserving and archiving african americans roles and contributions to american history we couldnt ask for a more esteemed scholar to put this african american town in its proper historical perspective
5753730 it is only appropriate that we commemorate the 100th anniversary of allensworth with the full participation of those scholars activists and leaders who recognize the historical significance of allensworth and its founders vision for california
5753731 this centennial celebration promises to be memorable for generations to come
5753732 i find the story of allensworth one that is instructive historically significant highly inspirational and important for all of us to remember
5753733 at a time when most black americans struggled to overcome bigotry poverty and the limitations created by segregation colonel allensworth and the other pioneering settlers of this community refused to accept a life of despair discrimination and limited opportunities because of this allensworth became a beacon of possibility whose influence and fame transcended the borders of california this is a story the nation should be proud of

5753735 the bottom line is that u s families raising children with disabilities are reporting severe hardships at rates that are chilling including families that are solidly middle class
5753736 we were shocked to find such high rates of hardship among upper income families
5753737 these results suggest that state and federal policies that are in place to help families with disabled children are not going nearly far enough
5753738 they are not eliminating deprivation and these findings are particularly troubling now when the nations economy is struggling families raising children with disabilities are likely to be hardest hit during this economic downturn
5753739 these families struggle to provide adequate care for their disabled children
5753740 trees planted in cities have a valuable role in the fight against climate change
5753741 urban trees remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and conserve energy when strategically planted to shade buildings which reduces greenhouse gas emissions at power plants
5753742 john mccain has had trouble being honest about his real record on renewable energy so unfortunately its not surprising that hed also continue to repeat mistruths about offshore drilling
5753743 meanwhile senator mccains allies held congress hostage to their pro oil agenda all summer while gas prices skyrocketed
5753744 increased by more than 361 percent yet gasoline prices have also risen dramatically there is simply no correlation between the two
5753745 this is one problem we cant drill our way out of
5753746 im aware that off the coast of louisiana and texas there are oil rigs as we well know and those rigs have survived very successfully the impacts of hurricanes
5753747 as for offshore drilling its safe enough these days that not even hurricanes katrina and rita could cause significant spillage
5753748 we withstood hurricanes rita and katrina and didnt spill a drop
5753749 ive talked to the actual people that do the work that are in the business that say within months and certainly within a very short time we could have additional oil supply for this nation so we ought to drill now

5753762 we knew that we needed to win this race and more in order to close down valentinos advantage so this makes the championship very difficult for us
5753763 anything can happen in racing but 50 points is a big gap against such a strong and consistent competitor
5753764 anyway i never throw in the towel nor does anybody at ducati and we will keep fighting until the end
5753765 misano is a home race for the factory and there will be lots of ducatisti there so my main thought now is to stay positive and bounce back with a good show for them in two weeks time
5753766 obviously we are all disappointed with this result because our pace in practice was good everything went very well this morning and we felt we could push out in front
5753767 things were going according to plan until the crash i was doing the same lap time over and over and i was quite happy with the pace i was running the crash came out of the blue that corner was an easy one but i lost the front and it happened very quickly very suddenly and i didnt manage to save it

5753865 the proposal allows for extremely limited domestic energy exploration but it appears to cement the now temporary off shore drilling ban permanently into statutory law while only allowing four states georgia north carolina south carolina and virginia to opt in
5753866 this is not even a half hearted attempt at more drilling its a quarter hearted attempt
5753867 the source of funding for the remaining 55 billion has yet to be determined but will likely take the form of tax hikes elsewhere that will only further harm the american economy and family budgets
5753868 instead of concocting ineffective political compromises a better course would be to repeal the domestic exploration ban now in its entirety and speed leasing efforts both on and off shore
5753869 this method would actually promise substantial supplies down the road and would not perpetuate any of the tax and spend proposals that have wasted so many taxpayer dollars over the past 30 plus years
5753870 hard pressed american families should recognize this compromise for what it really is the same old broken package wrapped up with a bipartisan bow

5753890 today nato demonstrated that it originated in and it is still from the time of the cold war it doesnt matter what their propaganda says
5753891 georgian president mikheil saakashvili got the right to start a war against the small people of south ossetia just because georgia had nato aspirations
5753892 the us was greatly involved in the preparation of this georgian aggression and here in brussels they were afraid to engage in a frank discussion with russia in the presence of their european allies
5753893 if the european union had not moved tbilisi would have been captured
5753894 russias actions were never intended to destroy occupy or force regime change in georgia
5753895 we will keep our very good bilateral contacts with nato members and hopefully there will be a better time sooner or later when nato understands that the world is very vulnerable and that bloc approaches are no longer possible

5753949 in 2002 president bush signed a born alive bill into law obama had said he would have supported that bill the national right to life committee says the language in the bill was the same and accuses obama of a four year effort to cover up his full role in killing legislation to protect born alive survivors of abortions looking at the bills the language is similar but the obama camp says while there were concerns about undermining illinois abortion law
5753950 a provision makes clear that it does not affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion obamas campaign points out that that added provision in that 2005 bill was a measure he had wanted in the past
5753951 well 2003 the national right to life committee will say the language is very similar but what the obama camp pointed out is that it lacked a provision to protect roe v wade that was the measure that was added two years later so that is the explanation why the campaign said and obama has said that he opposed that 2003 law
5753952 said the federal version he supported was not the bill that was presented at the state level
5753953 acknowledged that he had voted against an identical bill in the state senate and a spokesman hari sevugan said the senator and other lawmakers had concerns that even as worded the legislation could have undermined existing illinois abortion law

5753965 which doesnt actually help you because christianity is not judaism
5753966 once again youre unable to follow the bouncing ball if the magisterium isnt subject to scripture because it decides what it is and what it means then neither is steve subject to it for the same reasons try to pay attention youre so used to trotting out your favourite one liners that you cant seem to think clearly anymore about the issues
5753967 2 your parallel arguments attack the christian position in general by making all revelation subjective by way of the individuals position in the process
5753968 3 a church needs a rule of faith as a principle of unity
5753969 the catholic method is to continually subject oneself to the catholic understanding
5753970 its a principle which puts the overall direction of ones understanding in a continual movement towards commonality
5753971 the limitations of the individuals understanding do not impede this fact because his understanding is not bound to interpret what he finds in any old direction but rather in the direction of catholicity
5753972 protestants of the 21st century are further away from agreeing about anything than they were 500 years ago
5753973 individual protestants are just as likely to have their understand move away from that of their church than towards it leading to continual dispute confusion and church hopping
5753974 who said the only access to scripture is via the magisterium
5753975 thats like saying that because paul makes an infallible interpretation of genesis the only access anybody has had to genesis is via paul
5753976 and its quite relevant to point out that your definition of perspicuity makes sola scripture unworkable its the old bait and switch
5753977 first you claim scripture is perspicuous and then you define perspicuous so that it makes sola scripture unworkable
5753978 trap jesus in on or under a piece of bread
5753979 god cant damn you with a piece of jesus inside you
5753980 4 since you can only receive eucharist if you are in a state of grace it hardly seems rational to talk about the eucharist as primary means for remaining in a state of grace and avoiding dying in mortal sin
5753981 on paper steve honors the authority of scripture but in practice steves authority supplants and subverts biblical authority
5753982 and i was responding to the claim that catholicism is reducible to me and my magisterium
5753983 1 the laity doesnt always have to know the how and why of something to benefit from it if the magisterium keeps good order in the church through a correct understanding of scripture the laity benefits without knowing the details
5753984 2 even without linking dogma to specific verses the laity benefits from the correct understanding for example the laity benefits from the knowledge that it is correct to baptise infants without needing be told what texts might be relevant to that
5753985 pointing out the nonsense of your arguments about the magisterium not being subject to scripture does not lead to parity it just defeats your arguments
5753986 there is no parity between the church of god defining what scripture is compared to steve defining what scripture is that should be obvious to anyone
5753987 having a central authority make judgement cant have epistemological equivalence to every man and his dog making their own judgement
5753988 again the old bait and switch i refuted your argument that the magisterium is not subject to scripture now youre using that as bait and switch to pretend epistemological equivalence that wont wash
5753989 but i do note that your argument gives epistemological equivalence to atheists
5753990 thats like saying that the supreme courts interpretation is equivalent to my own because both must be filtered through my brain but youll find it aint so if you try and disregard a supreme court order the fact is institutions are needed to interpret texts its a fact of life and cant be refuted through some philosophical infinitely reductionist argument otherwise you could make the courts disappear in a puff of logic
5753991 if paul couldnt override other bible writers then clearly he was subject to them since it wasnt within his authority to override them case closed
5753992 as a matter of fact paul was not subject to a higher ot court of appeal
5753993 no my private judgement is with the aim of subjecting myself to a unifying principle which is the spirit led church
5753994 protestant private judgement is merely private judgement that doesnt care whether it leads you into or out of unity
5753995 if it leads you to found a new church with you as the only one in it so be it that is not an equivalent position
5753996 yes scripture is so perspicuous that you need commentaries sermons and internal light to understand it
5753997 but if someone else interprets differently and claims internal light youre left with nothing objective if someone is led astray by a bad commentary cest la vie
5753998 so perspicuity becomes a meaningless catchphrase that proves nothing and helps no one
5753999 the catholic faith itself is an infallible commentary on the bible
5754000 great so prove to me which of those books are infallible
5754001 neatly avoiding the point that the apostles did not limit their teaching to the written torah
5754002 nonsense prove to me that i wouldnt know to baptise infants unless it was written down
5754003 its not an evasion to point out that radical skepticism cuts both ways
5754004 how do you trace every link in every chain in every book back to the apostles or prophets and then do the same for every book which you dont think came from the apostles or prophets
5754005 obtusely equivocating between having teachings and having a list of teachings
5754006 what silliness the magisterium is in continuous contact with the rest of the church
5754007 and there is no reason to believe philip was infallible in his dealings with the eunuch
5754008 it seems to me it is you who is obsessed with infallibility
5754009 the point is someone in communion with the church could give him a correct interpretation
5754010 so is the protestant notion that they have the authority to interpret as individuals
5754011 and when exactly did they have the right to set up a new levitical priesthood
5754012 who would have interpreted the scriptures on how where and when to carry out temple sacrifices a every man and his dog b the levitical priesthood
5754013 people followed the tradition as best as they could grasp it
5754014 notice that the catholic principle of unity did pretty well even without a dogmatic proclamation
5754015 as do you but i have the higher view of providence
5754016 its antecedently absurd as a method for identifying truth since people claiming inspiration disagree
5754017 the aim isnt to prevent dissension but provide an identifiable source of unity for resolving it
5754018 what these supposedly more probably methods are we are not told
5754019 having the canon is worthless without understanding the canon to go half way with this argument is absurd we must believe that the church both has the canon and understands it
5754020 if god wants us to know the canon why dont all christians know the canon
5754021 if you want to nit pick around this kind of argument then suddenly you dont have a canon suddenly maybe your canon is just completely wrong
5754022 you need at some level to identify with the argument of what god is likely to do god is likely to make his word known
5754023 god is likely to make true scriptures clearly distinguishable from false ones
5754024 perhaps but the scriptures themselves have been occasion for both unity and division i dont think you would therefore reject scripture as a point of unity
5754025 again if you have no epistemic advantage in having pauls infallible interpretation of genesis then throw out paul you wont because you know it aint so
5754026 how this helps your case that people can get things right but without a valid reason to do so i cant see
5754027 luke doesnt say he received all his information directly from exclusively eyewitnesses he says his story is
5754028 it renders the claim as verifiable or unverifiable as many other theological claims
5754029 epistemologically however the magisterium is an entity created by the apostles and you arent so you dont get to claim epistemological equality
5754030 whats your definition of sola scripture that scripture is the sole infallible rule of faith for the church but hang on now youre claiming the church doesnt need a rule of faith for its unity and good governance oops there goes sola scriptura out the window
5754031 sorry you need to document your ramblings claiming stuff doesnt cut it
5754032 since paul is your infallible interpretive authority then the only real access you have to genesis is via the paul thanks for confirming what ive been saying
5754033 how does having an infallible bible alleviate the problem of subjectivity of the fallible individuals intepretation
5754034 but we dont allow it to be shaken to the ground because we believe in god leading his people such that we believe the testimony about the prophets we believe the testimony about paul and we believe the testimony about the magisterium
5754035 once we start making up for ourselves which bits we believe we shake our epistemological foundation with our personal opinions so that the church itself topples over
5754036 1 because the magisterium can react to the ongoing situation to clarify enough to retain unity in the church so it works as a rule of faith are you going to claim the church doesnt need a workable rule of faith
5754037 2 the magisterium has an historical and thus objective link with the scriptures via apostolic succession
5754038 thus steves claims about what scripture is and what it means are purely subjective in relational to someone elses claims
5754039 thats compounded with the problem that we dont have access to all the circumstances both immediate and cultural that give the text its full meaning grammatical historical exegesis at best comes up with a range of possible interpretations and the most likely one on a grammatical historical basis even if one could decide such a thing objectively which is itself a doubtful claim is not necessarily the true one
5754040 access to all the circumstances both immediate and cultural that give the text its full meaning
5754041 if we had the examples of the apostles doing gramatical historical exegesis on a consistent basis or even once for that matter then maybe youd have the kernel of an argument
5754042 there is no objective link between the bible and steve
5754043 no the magisterium couldnt override scripture because the magisterium and those writers were both writing under the power inspiration of the holy spirit himself and they had the same authority
5754044 1 notice that genembridges has a canon because of the principle he repudiates
5754045 2 notice that the early church only had an existence and a correct canon because of the same principle
5754046 3 notice that for all the talk by protestants about
5754047 if its not then dozens of heretical groups with and without their own scriptures have equal claims to the truth
5754048 what is unique about catholicism is historical continuity and objective link with jesus and the apostles
5754049 but catholics also have the trump card of being objectively the apostolic church
5754050 so you dont know if youre influenced by instruments of reprobation or of salvation quite a conundrum i hope you luck out in the end
5754051 there are over 3500 articles on the internet search them
5754052 do you believe philip was infallible in everything he said
5754053 if not then his claim to authority with the eunuch was his valid ordination
5754054 2 there is no reason to say he was living under any covenant he wasnt a jew or a christian
5754055 whatever veil he may have had about interpretation was lifted by oral communication with someone from the true church
5754056 not by someone with more scriptures not by someone who had read more scriptures but by someone with oral teachings
5754057 as in all these early church situations the apostles didnt practice sola scriptura they could hardly be teaching what they didnt practice
5754058 in other words all those cases of israel going astray did not invalidate the levitical priesthoods authority right up until a special intervention of the messiah
5754059 that puts in a very high standard of intervention before we should accept the existing authority over the people of god has been invalidated
5754060 first step is first which is acknowledging an authoritative magisterium just like you first have to acknowledge an authoritative levitical priesthood
5754061 again the obsession with infallibility lets start with authoritative and work our way to infallibility
5754062 wir wollen ein paar dinge bereinigen die uns in der vergangenheit als grob ungerecht aufgefallen sind
5754063 the playstation 4 and xbox 720 will arrive in 2011 or 2012 we think

5754065 but we think in three to four years time although there are good reasons why it should be 2010 already but well see

5754096 in nearly 20 years in this business ive never heard sexual orientation mentioned at all in discussing recruitment policies or individuals including people whose homosexuality is a matter of virtual public record
5754097 it took a little while to get the plans out and just how we were going to do this

5754111 lo que m s me ha gustado de estos d as cuando entrenaba en el vel dromo era el respeto que me han demostrado mis compa eros
5754112 sta era nuestra prueba cada vez que corro una americana me acuerdo de l no me gusta hablar del tema pero siempre le tengo en el coraz n y la cabeza

5754114 coupled with last weeks voluntary exit of more than 30 journalists

5754117 i just walked right on past him to the bedroom and got my gun
5754118 i said what are you doing in my house he just kept saying he didnt do it
5754119 i just hope i broke up the burglary ring because they have been hitting a lot of places around here
5754120 i knew he would get some prison time but i didnt expect it to be that harsh
5754121 he was the most visible outspoken voice of community activism in l a
5754122 najee ali has been on the wrong side of the law pretty consistently
5754123 he had the hit and run and now this it all finally caught up with him
5754124 he was going to project a message that said free tibet and some other messages that would have been three stories high in different locations in beijing
5754125 the most earnest exhortation repeated often enough becomes as pat as a television commercial after a while because i know everything the man is going to say and even the tone of voice in which he is going to say it i will very likely dial him out this does not necessarily indicate a lack of sympathy or a disagreement about social aims on my part on the contrary it is possible that i have reached a state of almost total agreement with the contemporary playwright that we have achieved a meeting of minds so absolute as to induce a kind of conversational paralysis i can anticipate every argument every illustration every conclusion he is prepared to offer i am confident that he is not going to come out in favor of lynching and if i am ever going to be honest about it i must admit that the good fellow bores me he is on the side of the angels so am i
5754126 well listen what this loser has to say advance to the next room and enjoy yourself
5754127 such talent and mastery that i did not yet notice no wonder my icy skills failed to harm you
5754128 i am a firm believer in progression just like a spark can set off a bushfire in australia your words can destroy the very home which we live in
5754129 i have a lot of faith but i am also afraid a lot and have no real certrainty about anything i remembered something father tom had told me that the opposite of faith is doubt but certainty certainty is missing the point entirely faith includes noticing the mess the emptiness and discomfort and letting it be there until some light returns faith also means reaching deeply within for the sense one was born with the sense for example to go for a walk
5754130 one time we came in three times in one day
5754131 originally what annasophia was diagnosed with was an interrupted aortic arch
5754132 when its a bicuspid the valve doesnt work as well so she needed immediate open heart surgery
5754133 i brought her in to the hospital for what i thought was stomach virus and she ended up getting very sick
5754134 in one week we went from her needing corrective surgery on the valve to shes never going to survive the surgery and the only option at that point was a heart transplant
5754135 initially we were told the wait could be as long as six to nine months and we all knew she did not really have that kind of time
5754136 we got a call one night that they had a heart for her and it was i cant even describe it
5754137 words cant describe it that feeling that someones just told you you have hope for your child
5754138 obviously its been a roller coaster ride and the emotional impacts on the family hasnt been easy but looking back you wouldnt trade it for anything
5754139 after you deal with the initial phases of anger and sadness frustration it really becomes and she has becomes such an inspiration to me as her father and shes just the embodiment of courage
5754140 when steve brought ethan and emily annasophias older siblings up and we all spent time as a family she was just so much more calm and content and smiled even around the table at breakfast that morning
5754141 she just looked around the table smiling like she knew this was just the way its meant to be
5754142 the president can go everywhere and we are not afraid of anything this icc is ridiculous
5754143 we will not show any respect to it we will just ignore it and disregard it
5754144 i started getting suspicious when the british woman approached leone and started chatting with him
5754145 suddenly she grabbed him by the arm apparently thinking nobody was watching him
5754146 persistent shelling in this area where two weeks ago a large number of internally displaced people sought refuge forced them to move again further inside kilinochchi
5754147 such multiple displacements are also adding to the delays in providing adequate shelter
5754148 many of the internally displaced people who are yet to receive temporary shelter and are thus still living under trees are struggling to seek shelter from the rain
5754149 sri lanka is a unique case of a government maintaining its offices and funding the administration in territories unlawfully occupied by a terrorist group
5754150 plans are under way to settle them in shelters located in safe areas prior to the commencement of the new school term there is absolutely no truth in the reports of internally displaced people living under trees
5754151 terrorists are now fleeing the areas in numbers following extensive military ground and air assaults
5754152 it is hoped that niue as host will take the lead in navigating change to combat the overwhelming effects of climate change and to encourage the pif to raise its stance on the issues of climate change and not just paying lip service but be active and promoting all means of renewable energy recycling re use and so forth

5754159 it took months and months of negotiations to get israel to allow some spare parts through the borders
5754160 what we really need is for things to be modernised we have funding and planning but israel wont allow the machinery in
5754161 its affecting our port its affecting the fishermen its affecting the fish we eat and the people swimming in the sea

5754163 since sanctions it is very difficult to get the ingredients i need
5754164 we have had to cut production drastically to keep going
5754165 i thought things would improve with the ceasefire and that more things would be allowed into gaza but nothing changed nothing changed at all
5754166 i t is a defendants action enabling him to inflict a present injury that constitutes the actus reus of assault there is no requirement that the injury would necessarily occur as the very next step in the sequence of events or without any delay
5754167 assault may occur even when the infliction of injury is prevented by environmental conditions or by steps taken by victims to protect themselves

5754172 weve now seen about 100 000 military aged men missing they may have been murdered
5754173 ethnic albanians in kosovo have neither been nor are now exposed to regional or countrywide group persecution in the federal republic of yugoslavia

5754176 were doing this because its time for us to think differently about how we approach the business
5754177 today the market is much more fragmented with multiple brands and multiple competitors and our own beverage portfolio is highly complex with more than 25 big brands which demands an integrated portfolio approach to optimize the entire breadth of offerings
5754178 i know that any organization change is initially disruptive to our people and our systems however i want to assure you that the entire nab team and i feel very confident that this structure will allow us to reignite profitable growth in our beverage business

5754187 white fue profesor durante a os y dec a que no estaba interesado en formar fot grafos sino en ense ar a mirar dec a que tenemos demasiado ruido interior y que por eso no podemos mirar porque mirar es en realidad encontrar un v nculo entre lo de afuera y nuestro interior
5754188 mi trabajo ha sido siempre una especie de epifan a frente a un tema y creo que en este nuevo proyecto esa epifan a ha desaparecido de alguna manera he sentido que el tema empezaba a convertirse en una c rcel
5754189 tomar fotos fue para m durante a os una forma de entender a mi pa s un pa s en el que muchas veces se me ha observado como un intruso como un gringo y al que por otro lado siempre me he sentido muy ligado en t rminos espirituales
5754190 esos intereses que pueden parecer temporales van sedimentando tu mirada yo llev un curso con robles godoy y qued fascinado con un grupo de amigos convencimos a un publicista exitoso de la poca estamos hablando del a o 66 para que invirtiera una suma muy alta en equipos cinematogr ficos moviolas c maras luces pasamos dos a os buscando dinero para filmar in tilmente llegamos incluso a hacer un comercial para suzuki que pr cticamente regalamos una especie de western filmado en pucusana

5754196 if online researchers can more easily find prevailing opinion they are more likely to follow it leading to more citations referencing fewer articles
5754197 findings and ideas that do not become consensus quickly will be forgotten quickly
5754198 i had to find these damned articles on pcr generated mutagenesis and i am going to make sure i get maximum usage out of them
5754199 say i wrote a paper in 2007 that didnt come out for a year says luis amaral a physicist working on complex systems at northwestern university in evanston illinois whose findings clash with evanss
5754200 this paper with a date of 2008 is citing papers from 2005 2006
5754201 pcr has been used to create mutations in a gene sequence
5754202 no longer demonstrates the hard work put into gathering those references
5754203 narrow ing of the range of findings and ideas built upon
5754204 if we ever come back here we need to check that out
5754205 i will be appointing hopefully later this week a firm of independent consultants to carry out an investigation on our behalf
5754206 these will be consultants who have not been involved in any way with the work to date on the underpass contract
5754207 and the sorts of things i want them to look at will be the whole background intensity of the rainfall to establish clearly the cause of the flooding to look at the design and to look at the construction standards
5754208 we have to realise that it appears that torrential rain is going to occur on a more regular basis the weekend was no freak occurrence
5754209 this means we have to introduce measures to adapt to this situation new strategies are needed to ensure that flash flooding is minimised and that a co ordinated emergency strategy is in place to cope with the consequences of flooding
5754210 i urge the executive to get to grips with the twin issues of improving our response to flooding and adapting our environmental and planning strategies to deal with increased rain in the future
5754211 you must change the nameservers in order to test your domains
5754212 that in the revision of the cases they have demonstrated a series of faults in the judicial system that allowed for the incarceration of innocent people without the minimum judicial guarantees a situation that lends itself to the political persecution of social leaders and a veiled policy of the criminalization of protest

5754274 paternity fraud is a growing concern for men and children everywhere
5754275 it can spawn considerable grief for the men who may or may not be emotionally attached to a child they later discover was fathered by another and possibly unsettling for children who may discover the false nature of their paternity
5754276 paternity fraud is a growing problem for both men who should have a higher level of confidence on the paternity of their children and for the children who need a reliable history of both parents for the maintenance of their physical and emotional health

5754278 the nypds latest plan to track and monitor the movements of millions of law abiding people is an assault on this countrys historical respect for the right to privacy and the freedom to be left alone that this is happening without public debate and that elected officials have had no opportunity to study this program is even more alarming

5754284 could not say when the program operation sentinel would be completed
5754285 the lower manhattan initiative is expected to be in place by 2010
5754286 it is one tool of ensuring that if there is somebody on a terrorist watch list or someone driving erratically or if a pattern develops that raises suspicions it gives them an opportunity to investigate further and if need be track down the drivers or the passengers
5754287 the bottom line is they cant frisk everybody coming into manhattan they cannot wand everyone as they do at airports this is a passive collection of data that is not as personally invasive as what they do at airports
5754288 they know they did something wrong and they were still ignorant
5754289 at first i just wanted an apology now because they want ed to be ignorant and rude i have to take it to the next level
5754290 as the officers were in the lower apartment one of the detectives reviewed the search warrant application and realized it was for the upper apartment
5754291 it appears to be an honest mistake and we certainly apologize to all involved
5754292 we can say comfortably that over 1 100 search warrants were executed last year and 580 to date this year and that with such a high volume and such a fast paced environment it is understandable that mistakes could happen

5754320 wenn ich das alter sehe ray dann sehe ich dass die fasern der menschen energiereich sind wie eh und je der feinstoffliche k rper altert nicht und doch k nnen ltere menschen sich spirituell schwach f hlen weil sich ihr k rper schw cher anders anf hlt und wozu zwingt das alter den menschen den augenblick zu genie en nicht alles auf einmal zu tun und mit bedacht an dinge heranzugehen was f r eine sch ne sache wenn wir solche tugenden auf den sch nsten zeitvertreib der welt anwenden
5754321 ich kannte alte menschen die in hohem alter noch ein intensives liebsleben unterhielten selbst das verliebtsein soll sich anf hlen als sei man jung

5754323 i am very disappointed and i cant understand why world snooker hasnt discussed dates with us
5754324 our dates for the premier league were set in april of this year following consultation with world snooker venues were booked and the seven competing players were contracted in may
5754325 as the premier league is televised live im afraid that we will be sticking to our dates and insisting that the four competing players on the thursday night duly honour their contracts
5754326 its a shame that world snooker made no effort to avoid conflicting schedules and will subsequently be losing four top players from their event
5754327 beim thema sex gibt es einen wesentlichen punkt an dem du dich orientieren kannst der kernpunkt ist einfach die f higkeit den orgasmus deines partners zu w nschen und zu zu lassen das der partner lust erlebt oder lust empfindet ist nicht selbstverst ndlich viele religionen waren darauf aus die sexualit t des menschen unter kontrolle zu bringen und in der lust etwas verwerfliches oder b ses zu sehen aus meiner sicht ist dieser standpunkt f r den energiefluss des k rpers aus reiner energiebilanzsicht sch dlich
5754328 das ist schnell erkl rt die sexuelle energie steigt im menschen an einer anderen stelle auf als die liebe entsteht der fluss der liebe aus dem solarplexus flie t die k rpermitte herunter und steigt am r cken wieder auf er dreht einen kopf breit ber dem kopf wieder um und f llt wie ein kleiner wasserfall in den solar plexus zur ck wenn die liebe also die sexuelle energie ber hrt
5754329 hat die energie bereits eine weg durch den k rper hinter sich wird die sexualit t gehemmt oder gebannt dann wird ein teil der liebe ebenfalls gehemmt oder gebannt der mensch wird schwacher angreifbarer von au en deswegen wird es in manchen religionen oder sekten gemacht den menschen menschliche gesetzen f gbar zu machen
5754330 aus dieser argumentation kannst du aber nicht ableiten dass die menschen st ndig sex miteinander haben sollten damit der fluss der energie nicht gest rt wird
5754331 wenn ich meinem partner erlaube und ihm es w nsche zum h hepunkt zu kommen dann verbinden sich liebe traum und vorstellung miteinander wenn zwei menschen sich lieben ist es wichtig dass sie die grenzen der liebe respektieren d h tue nichts bei dem sich der partner nicht mehr lieben kann w hrend einerseits wir unseren partnern das gef hl geben du wirst geliebt auch mit deiner geschlechtlichkeit tun wir nichts das der partner nicht aus liebe tun w rde denn wenn wir menschen etwas tun das wir nicht lieben dann werden wir uns selbst dabei nicht lieben k nnen der fluss der liebe stoppt wir haben den partner an eine grenze der liebe gebracht
5754332 mann und frau haben einen unterschiedlichen rhythmus d h der mann wird h ufig der dr ngelnde teil sein darf er seinen partner aufgrund seiner k rperlichen befindlichkeit zu etwas bringen wobei dieser sich nicht mag aus spiritueller sicht darf er es nicht er sollte seine sexuelle in virtuelle kinder stecken bis die frau in stimmung ist oder er sollte seinen k rper aus eigenem antrieb genie en was f r menschen schwierig ist deren religion sagt dass selbstbefriedigung eine s nde sei siehe onan aus der bibel
5754333 der dr ngelnde teil der einer religion angeh rt die die einsame lust am k rper verbietet findet sich mitunter mit anspr chen gegen den partner wieder
5754334 statt dessen k nnen wir menschen auf die richtige gelegenheit warten wir k nnen uns darauf freuen wie auf ein gutes essen wir k nnen uns das gute essen vorstellen sexuelle tagtr ume in denen der partner vorkommt k nnen wertvolle anregungen ber die sexuellen w nsche des partners geben ist eine verbindung liebevoll und gewaltfrei und entspannt dann k nnen die partner sich ihre sexuellen tagtr ume erz hlen und austauschen h ufig ist das wovon sie tr umen nicht das wie es sich in einer gelebten wirklichkeit dann anf hlt doch der austausch leitet den prozess des abgleichs ein und f hrt die partner nach und nach in eine sexuelle verspielte welt in der die lust sich st ndig ver ndert
5754335 wie das meer immer wieder an das ufer brandet und doch keine welle der anderen gleicht so k nnen sexuelle phantasien sich im tagtraum erst ruhig hin und her bewegen w hrend das nahende ufer das der sexuellen vereinigung entspricht rollt die welle der tagtraum dem land entgegen und die welle wird gr er und gr er bis sie sich berschl gt und in wei er gischt zerbricht
5754336 sexualit t ist ein lebenslanger prozess der auch in den mittleren jahren und im alter weiter vorangeht und auch hier l sst sich aus spiritueller sicht einiges dazu sagen
5754337 die menschen g be es schon lange nicht mehr wenn wir nicht die f higkeit bes en zu lieben und liebe in anderen menschen wecken zu k nnen die f higkeit zu lieben bedeutet das leben wie es ist anzunehmen nur so konnten die menschheit auch die h rtesten strapazen berleben denn die liebe ffnet kraftzentren spirituelle kraftzentren die den k rper dopen die in ihm mehr kraft und effizienz wecken als ohne liebe wir beide werden im rahmen unserer wanderungen entlang des saumes der unendlichkeit auch den geist der menschlichen gattung besuchen und du wirst sehen dass er ein versprechen mit sich tr gt
5754338 die menschheit wird als art bestehen solange die menschen lieben k nnen wann immer der letzte mensch nicht mehr mit liebe erf llt ist dann wird der geist der gattung mensch sich umdrehen und ohne jede verz gerung diese erde verlassen
5754339 wenn du lernst zu lieben dann tr gst du dazu bei das der geist der gattung in dieser generation auf der erde bleibt wenn du lernst in anderen die liebe zu wecken dann bleibt der geist der gattung solange diese menschen leben
5754340 wenn du lernst den menschen generell die f higkeit beizubringen liebe zu finden dann bleiben wir menschen vielleicht solange die erde lebt und das ist unabh ngig davon ob es krieg gibt oder nicht ob menschen hassen oder nicht ob die menschen wollen oder nicht
5754341 der geist der liebe ist das leben der art das spirituelle wasser der menschen
5754342 ich wei dass du ein intensives liebesgef hl f r mich empfunden hast und ich bringe dir jetzt bei wie du das bei anderen auch erreichen kannst wenn du es denn willst f hle mich mal
5754343 stelle dir mal vor du best ndest nur aus diesem sprudelnden quirligen nass
5754344 lass diese fl ssigkeit deine k rpermitte herunterlaufen und an deinem r cken wieder aufsteigen bis es einen kopf breit ber dir wieder auf dich herunter flie t
5754345 so ray und nun stelle dir vor in anderen menschen fl sse derselbe strom suche ihn sieh ihn
5754346 was ist das f r eine ursache die es den menschen schwer fallen l sst ihre liebe flie en zu lassen
5754347 es sind die feinde der liebe gier unrast macht und trotz jedes dieser vier gef hle kann den fluss der liebe zum stoppen bringen aber jeder der in sich selbst die liebe flie en lassen kann kann andere ber hren und deren liebe wieder in fluss bringen ber hre die solar plexus dieser menschen
5754348 wann immer du jemanden begegnest ber hre ihn kurz und bringe seinen fluss der liebe in bewegung es kostet dich so gut wie keine energie aber euer verh ltnis wird bestens sein und nun zum eigentlichen thema sex

5754358 why do you cry i have gifted you with consolations honors and glory which have been denied to the millions of your countrymen i made you the youngest war correspondent presidential assistant mayor vice governor governor and senator of the republic and i recall you never thanked me for all these gifts i have given you a full life a great wife and beautiful lovable children now that i visit you with a slight desolation you cry and whimper like a spoiled brat
5754359 i went down on my knees and begged his forgiveness i know i was merely undergoing a test maybe in preparation for another mission i know everything that happens in this world is with his knowledge and consent i knew he would not burden me with a load i could not carry i therefore resigned myself to his will

5754374 people from the georgian security agencies asked me to block russian sites

5754410 this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one

5754419 ignores her students mostly a very false personality and especially when handing out praise incredibly patronising and not very bright
5754420 not only is the book a better teacher it also has a better personality
5754421 students who post ratings may be regarded as experts who have had significant experience with the professors
5754422 they may also have consulted with a number of other students who share the same perspective so that online ratings may represent a far larger and more representative sample of students than the numbers suggest

5754470 you just cant put forward concepts and knowledge relationships like flinging hash
5754471 no other structure is in the same league as the common sense basis of cyc weve found its knowledge framework to be flexible enough for any customer context
5754472 in the cyc project weve been working to develop the knowledge representations and reasoning capabilities for intelligent software that collaborates with its users although researchers have been using some of the results for a few years now the recent growth of the semantic web presented both a need and opportunity to have a dramatically greater impact opencyc is the language that can tie the disparate parts of the semantic web together
5754473 by representing and sharing knowledge in the same language semantic web applications can be enormously more powerful
5754474 common semantic vocabularies are the missing link for the semantic web blogs cover an incredible range of subjects so meaning based content integration using the huge opencyc ontology can provide an amazing user experience for bloggers and other content authors
5754475 if someone is interested in a product information about components of that product may be relevant
5754476 if someone is interested in a product component they may be interested in a companys competitors who also rely on that component
5754477 we think that a rich ontology like opencyc can enable us to extend iglue with new information or to validate the existing data using logical inference and it has the potential to provide a base for a common semantic infrastructure as a sort of entity yellow pages

5754513 we dodged a bullet with the storm so thats leading to some selling
5754514 if this storm had happened a couple of weeks ago it would have driven prices higher the momentum of this market is definitely on the downside as people realize that demand is very soft

5754526 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks
5754527 behind all of these claims and positions by sen obama lies the ambition to be president whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief

5754531 we should not keep sending our troops to fight tour after tour of duty while our military is overstretched we should not keep spending 10 billion a month in iraq while americans struggle in a sluggish economy
5754532 ending the war will allow us to invest in america to strengthen our military and to finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan and the border region of pakistan
5754533 this crisis underscores the need for engaged u s leadership in the world
5754534 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed american leadership means getting engaged earlier to shape events so that were not merely responding to them
5754535 were happy to win the superclasico now weve got to put everything behind us and move on
5754536 rio when he was captain played very well the same level as john

5754561 si deve tener presente che specialmente in assenza di un vero spazio di libert per valutare la moralit di un atto occorre conoscere con particolare cura le reali intenzioni della persona interessata oltre alla mancanza oggettiva
5754562 questo ha condizionato seriamente il cammino della chiesa dando adito anche a sospetti accuse reciproche e denunce e ha creato una situazione che continua ad essere una preoccupante debolezza della chiesa stessa
5754563 la moralit dellatto umano dipende anzitutto e fondamentalmente dalloggetto ragionevolmente scelto dalla volont deliberata come prova anche la penetrante analisi tuttora valida di san tommaso per poter cogliere loggetto di un atto che lo specifica moralmente occorre quindi collocarsi nella prospettiva della persona che agisce
5754564 il papa giovanni paolo ii in occasione del grande giubileo ha pi volte esortato i cristiani a far penitenza delle infedelt passate crediamo che la chiesa santa ma in essa vi sono uomini peccatori bisogna respingere il desiderio di identificarsi soltanto con coloro che sono senza peccato come avrebbe potuto la chiesa escludere dalle sue file i peccatori per la loro salvezza che ges si incarnato morto ed risorto occorre perci imparare a vivere con sincerit la penitenza cristiana praticandola confessiamo i peccati individuali in unione con gli altri davanti a loro e a dio conviene tuttavia guardarsi dalla pretesa di impancarsi con arroganza a giudici delle generazioni precedenti vissute in altri tempi e in altre circostanze occorre umile sincerit per non negare i peccati del passato e tuttavia non indulgere a facili accuse in assenza di prove reali o ignorando le differenti condizioni di allora inoltre la confessio peccati per usare unespressione di santagostino deve essere sempre accompagnata dalla confessio laudis dalla confessione della lode chiedendo perdono del male commesso nel passato dobbiamo anche ricordare il bene compiuto con laiuto della grazia divina che pur depositata in vasi di creta ha portato frutti spesso eccellenti

5754726 its naive when people think that youre going to have a couple of politicians get together and solve the conflict in the middle east theres a level of arrogance there
5754727 sometimes politicians get wrapped up in what we can achieve rather than what we should achieve
5754728 there are many many places where a homeland for the palestinians could in fact take place that would be consistent with their roots but there is only one place on earth where the jewish people could have a homeland that is consistent with their roots
5754729 it is a historic reality that jerusalem and the entire land was originally intended to be a homeland for the jewish people the palestinians should in fact have a place and opportunity to settle but it doesnt have to be in jerusalem

5754739 canadian financials have to be treated quite differently were nowhere near the pain of writeoffs that have been endured by u s and european financials

5754741 it will cost us money halving the size of the bin does not half the waste in a household
5754742 the councils must be aware that their responsibility is to provide a service to the general public not to punish us or fine us but to get us to work with them so we can see recycling rates shoot up
5754743 smaller bins create problems in that if you do the same round with smaller bins you still need to do the round as often and often residents like that because it can be weekly
5754744 but then what happens is the truck is doing the same round consuming the same fuel polluting the atmosphere to the same amount but now only half full
5754745 we will collect the 140 bin weekly our residents were concerned about odour and flies weve listened to them and we wont go ahead with alternate weekly collections

5754752 what happened last year was a crime and i was part of this crime against the jewish nation

5754754 and i cant understand why they would put him on a panel the people of gush etzion embraced us when the expulsion happened and it is difficult for me now to see another face i cant understand how they can do this right as were commemorating the third anniversary of the expulsion there has to be a limit to what they can do to us
5754755 we must do everything we can to avoid polarization of our society and the establishment of two states for one people as happened 50 years after king davids regime
5754756 it cannot be that a group of people would show such ungratefulness to the army for what it has done and will so undemocratically boycott an army general for his beliefs i had invested much time and effort into this event and it was a great dream of mine but im willing to pay this price
5754757 i was never too enthusiastic about the event to begin with because of the participation of yossi sarid former head of the anti religious meretz party and the like
5754758 i explained the situation to him and why it was painful for people if he would appear but i told him that i felt the decision was his to make to his credit he understood and withdrew
5754759 but it certainly is not correct to say it was an undemocratic move it was not undemocratic to boycott hacohen and it was not undemocratic to cancel the event

5754768 the main thing im hoping for three weeks away from the semis is that we dont continually limp our way through the next three weeks and struggle when we get there
5754769 to be so good for 20 weeks it would be a shame now to undo all that as it would for the roosters
5754770 were both struggling a bit i think we spoke about five weeks ago about geez were in a good position could be top four and since then weve struggled a bit
5754771 they were brilliant for the first 12 14 weeks and maybe both of us have hit the wall
5754772 three weeks out its time to get some red cordial and have some coffee and do whatever you can to get a bit excited
5754773 we have to stand up and win games big games on the big stage and unfortunately weve let ourselves down in games like manly and brisbane
5754774 we just have to learn to handle it if were going to go good in the semi finals
5754775 unfortunately theres only a few of us who have played semi final football
5754776 the build up to the manly game had a semi final feel about it and maybe shellshocked a few of the boys so hopefully were a little bit more used to it now and we can handle it a bit better this week

5754794 having said that the games about the players and they determine the outcomes of the games
5754795 at the end of the day theyve been hit with some injuries and with that comes a drop in confidence and a drop in form
5754796 and theyve lost a lot of close games the previous year they won them
5754797 but you could argue that in patches during the year theyve played very well and i expect them to be very competitive this week at home

5754810 as one of the judges i was thrilled and inspired to see such a diverse and creative range of proposals for how to make the daily work of scientists easier and more productive we await the semi finalists presentations in december with bated breath
5754811 the semi finalists will be given access to more than half a million life science articles including their images and supplementary files in order to build their tool
5754812 access to such a large and diverse body of work will give them the opportunity to scale up their ideas and really test them to see if they can make something that will change the way life scientists read write visualize even think about data

5754852 we feel for the pakistan cricket board and the people of pakistan but it is the job of the aca to make recommendations to our members based on whether it is safe to tour
5754853 unfortunately in this case we dont believe it is safe

5754855 whilst its not ideal that we go away with a limited preparation its a fantastic opportunity for this group to begin our super 14 2009 preparations
5754856 one of the beauties of this tour is we can take players out of their comfort zone in terms of the travel in terms of the short schedule between games so guys will really have to be vigilant with their preparation
5754857 you dont get any easy games in france so theyll provide us with a different style of opposition to the irish

5754860 its hard not to live in the moment and for me at the moment i havent been able to get what i want out of footy
5754861 so at the moment im sort of frustrated i have been frustrated by what has happened this year
5754862 but my career as a whole has been really successful
5754863 i was waking up and not really looking forward to playing footy as i had in previous years and you just get the feeling it is time
5754864 medical practitioner will tell you these blokes have a mass body index of fat that doesnt match their height
5754865 its important that we get together now to prepare for what will possibly be our toughest qualifier for the world cup because we go into the unknown against uzbekistan
5754866 were going into an environment that were not used to and they had an extremely good qualifying round previously so its going to be tough
5754867 ever since guus hiddink came in and completely changed our formations and got us thinking about different styles weve learned to adapt to anything
5754868 and the uzbeks have got us thinking were going to have to work on our system and our system only and make sure that we can adapt in the first five minutes to whatever gets thrown at us
5754869 the next few games arent about winning necessarily its about a good performance and preparing for uzbekistan which inevitably is the most important game
5754870 we saw a little bit of them at the asian cup last year they looked a pretty good side
5754871 theyre going to be a very very difficult game for us away thats why these two friendly games are important because we can get together as a squad and get some game time under our belts
5754872 medical practitioner will tell you these blokes have a mass body index of fat that doesnt match their height
5754873 the all blacks have some great tactical kickers so in a sense we had to slow the game down last week
5754874 the aussies dont have great tactical kickers and we have to speed things up thats why weve gone with jantjes
5754875 i think fourie does have a yard or two on ricky other than that i dont think theres much difference between the two
5754876 hed be great to play against hes a fantastic player one of the best players obviously getting around as a winger
5754877 im kind of caught between the devil and the deep blue sea but we cant back off now
5754878 were at 60 per cent of where we want to be so we have to bite the bullet and see if we can get there
5754879 in playing total rugby there is going to be a fear factor
5754880 theyll see us as a different proposition than the all blacks and theyll identify some things that they think will work for them
5754881 ive got no idea what they are but they will have some plans for sure

5754883 the purpose of the convention is to promote protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights by persons with disabilities it covers a number of key areas such as accessibility personal mobility health education employment habilitation and rehabilitation participation in political life and equality and non discrimination the convention marks a shift in thinking about disability from a social welfare concern to a human rights issue which acknowledges that societal barriers and prejudices are themselves disabling
5754884 a universal legally binding standard is needed to ensure that the rights of persons with disabilities are guaranteed everywhere the un standard rules on the equalization of opportunities for disabled persons 1993 have served as model legislation for a number of countries they provide policy guidelines on promoting the same opportunities to persons with disabilities that others enjoy however the standard rules are not a legally binding instrument and disability advocates note that there are no enforceable obligations without a convention
5754885 attitudes rather than resource constraints often create the strongest barriers to the enjoyment of rights by persons with disabilities
5754886 bear the primary responsibility for ensuring equality and eliminating discrimination but we all must also acknowledge our own responsibility and act accordingly
5754887 must play a role in ensuring that progress is made everywhere since empowering persons with disabilities to enjoy their human rights is a collective obligation

5754921 people describe it as having a mind of its own
5754922 new guidelines recommending that women not perform breast self examinations bses could seriously endanger womens health and lead to later detection of cancers in some women
5754923 these guidelines do not reflect a new point of view but they are still very bad advice
5754924 early detection of breast cancer is crucial not only to the survivorship of a patient but to her quality of life while treating the cancer and thereafter for many patients early detection could mean not having to lose a breast through mastectomy or not having to experience aggressive chemotherapy
5754925 the world of early detection of breast cancer is imperfect there is not one test that will detect all cancers early
5754926 it also sends the wrong message to women about their role in their own health care especially today when so many women cannot afford expensive doctor visits and medical testing
5754927 there are also inherent limitations to the value and quality of mammograms and clinical breast examinations
5754928 this kind of flawed advice truly disempowers women by suggesting that they need not take proactive steps in examining themselves for signs that something may be wrong this is so important to me because at breastcancer org were all about empowering patients and we explicitly recommend breast self exams

5755012 we were pleased to see the recent steps taken by los angeles to ratchet up their water conservation including their implementation of prohibiting certain types of outdoor water use
5755013 while some have questioned the approach weve taken on conservation nearly one year ago now we felt then just as we continue to believe today long term mandatory prohibitions on certain outdoor uses of water need to be a way of life here in southern california the fact of the matter is that our state would be in a much better position to forestall and lessen the impact of an approaching crisis if more of our water was being saved
5755014 the board took the action it did when it did to forestall and lessen the impact of an expected water supply shortage
5755015 conservation is no longer just a civic virtue it is fast emerging as a statewide necessity

5755050 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5755051 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5755052 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5755053 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5755054 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5755055 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5755056 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5755057 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5755058 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5755059 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5755060 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5755061 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5755062 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children

5755319 i spoke to a few people and they all had great stories about celtic so i only expect the best now in the beginning there was only rangers but in the end i decided that it was celtic that i wanted to play for and that is who i want to focus on
5755320 rhetoric is only part of a presidents power but its an important part building public enthusiasm for your efforts helps overcome legislative and administrative barriers as in their different ways franklin roosevelt john kennedy ronald reagan and bill clinton showed declaring a clear position makes a difference even within an administration appointees of the reagan administration spent less time arguing about the presidents goals and intentions than staffers in some other eras because reagans speeches were so often designed to say just what the intentions were i worked for two years as jimmy carters speechwriter many issues had to be fought out at every level of the administration and finally resolved in speeches in part because he was less comfortable than reagan in presenting a big clear simple summary of his goals
5755321 supporting new american dreams break the bottled water habit campaign with our wellness h2 o water bottle gives consumers an opportunity to make a difference environmentally brings critical support and attention to environmental preservation and saves money that would have been wasted on throw away bottles
5755322 it is imperative that every person in the united states be more aware of their purchasing decisions and their personal impact on the environment
5755323 why produce nearly a million tons of plastic to cart billions of gallons of water all over the country when clean virtually free water flows right into our taps using the wellness h2 o water bottle gives consumers direct access to purified water that is actually better for them than tap or bottled water

5755325 i dont expect to win this race my goal is to finish ill probably end up crawling across the finish line but ill do it
5755326 to help you discover the best sites that you never knew existed
5755327 im starting to suspect that the evan bayh boomlet is designed to make tim kaine look better by comparison because really evan bayh is about the only democrat who makes tim kaine look palatable by comparison as obamas veep
5755328 of the people i dont really want to be veep who keep showing up on those fake short lists people keep coming up with he bothers me the least
5755329 personally i still think those significant negatives would make her a terrible pick unfortunately im resigned to obama making a terrible pick with someone else anyway biden bayh kaine so if its between one of those three terrible picks or clinton i throw my hands up in the air
5755330 in this byelection you can tell harper how you really feel
5755331 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
5755332 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
5755333 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
5755334 cooking with biofuels such as wood dung and crop residue
5755335 open biomass burning associated with deforestation and crop residue burning
5755336 soot and other forms of black carbon could have as much as 60 percent of the current our italics global warming effect of carbon dioxide
5755337 black carbon particles only remain airborne for weeks at most compared to carbon dioxide which remains in the atmosphere for more than a century
5755338 over 400 000 annual fatalities among women and children are attributed to smoke inhalation during indoor cooking
5755339 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
5755340 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
5755341 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly
5755342 when you can take advantage of someone else going out and providing the deals the way they do its awesome
5755343 its so easy anyone can do it were looking forward to doing it over and over again
5755344 the concierge found the property for me with just a click of a mouse there it is they also found the mortgage company they found my lease option tenant they did all the work and we were able to close in our own living room
5755345 dave has been a terrific partner and friend to me he will do an incredible job as ceo of quiznos for many years to come
5755346 dave is a natural leader whom everyone likes and respects with a stellar track record of over 25 years in the quick service restaurant qsr industry at yum pepsico and burger king among other things he has done an incredible job of leading the management team during the implementation of the catering and delivery program and spurring quiznos international growth both of which will drive the brand for at least the next decade i speak for the board and all the quiznos partners in saying we look forward to his leadership of the brand for years to come
5755347 the flawless transition at quiznos from the founders to a professional management team is a tremendous tribute to my friend and partner quiznos founder rick schaden
5755348 along with franchise owners and quiznos employees rick grew the business from 18 to over 5000 restaurants and then about two years ago executed a seamless handoff to me and our new management team
5755349 quiznos is one of the finest brands in all of qsr and leading it fulfills a life long dream for me
5755350 moving forward our strategy will be exactly as it is today our primary focus will be on increasing restaurant profitability for our franchise owners by bringing our great products value and convenience to consumers so that they use quiznos more often in the us and around the world we are very pleased with the profits for our franchise owners from our new delivery and catering program through our talented executive team and franchise owners we have accomplished more in a year in implementing delivery and catering than virtually anything else i have ever done we should also remain one of the fastest growing brands in qsr with a very diverse mix of development in both the us and international markets
5755351 greg has been and will continue to be a great mentor partner and friend to me
5755352 he has done a terrific job at quiznos building a world class management team which was ranked the best new management team in qsr by qsr magazine last year putting in place a clear strategy and driving execution as we have moved the brand forward his entire focus has been to improve the lives of quiznos franchise owners and he is relentless in his desire to see them succeed and in his communication with them as happened at continental pwc consulting and burger king gregs leadership and vision have helped position quiznos for long term success we are all fortunate he will remain active in our business as executive chairman

5755354 greg has done a great job at quiznos from the beginning his goal was to put in place and execute a focused growth strategy and world class management team so that he could transition to a role that fits his longer term desires these strategies are now in place and the company is well positioned for long term growth greg and i were both thrilled when dave agreed to join the quiznos management team earlier this year and are very pleased to have him as our ceo greg dave and i have a terrific relationship and look forward to working together for years to come
5755355 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5755356 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5755357 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5755358 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5755359 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5755360 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5755361 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
5755362 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
5755363 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
5755364 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
5755365 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
5755366 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5755367 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5755368 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5755369 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5755370 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5755371 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5755372 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5755373 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
5755374 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
5755375 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly
5755376 when you can take advantage of someone else going out and providing the deals the way they do its awesome
5755377 its so easy anyone can do it were looking forward to doing it over and over again
5755378 the concierge found the property for me with just a click of a mouse there it is they also found the mortgage company they found my lease option tenant they did all the work and we were able to close in our own living room
5755379 the presentations have typically generated some open discussion about how we can reduce the amount of carbon emissions
5755380 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
5755381 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
5755382 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
5755383 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
5755384 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
5755385 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
5755386 20 wind by 2030 increasing wind energy contribution to u s electric supply
5755387 would be accomplished solely through private investment with no new customer or corporate taxes or government regulation
5755388 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
5755389 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
5755390 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5755391 most americans still dont know as marshall writes that on the campaign trail mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused most americans still dont know it is precisely for this reason that the mccain campaign has now shut down the presss previously unfettered access to the candidate on the straight talk express
5755392 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
5755393 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
5755394 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
5755395 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics
5755396 she was a stray but she worked her way up
5755397 well just be sending each other e mails at two in the morning instead of two in the afternoon
5755398 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
5755399 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
5755400 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
5755401 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
5755402 they told me there are going to be resources here
5755403 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
5755404 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
5755405 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
5755406 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
5755407 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
5755408 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
5755409 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
5755410 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
5755411 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5755412 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5755413 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5755414 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5755415 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5755416 we are gratified to receive the ca smart seal of excellence
5755417 we are starting to see some powerful web 2 0 ajax applications being developed with ca plex and webclient we plan to add even more capabilities in the future such as additional ajax components and automation of ca plex ui functions via soap web services
5755418 ca plex and webclient are helping us develop true web 2 0 applications faster and less expensively than ever before
5755419 both products operating together as a framework have enabled us to streamline development and optimize the functionality of the solutions we deliver
5755420 webclient is a well designed solution that helps ca plex customers responds to market opportunities more quickly and resource efficiently
5755421 adc austin exemplifies the leading role that our channel partners play in bringing the full potential benefits of ca plex to the development community
5755422 because god is never cruel there is a reason for all things we must know the pain of loss because if we never knew it we would have no compassion for others and we would become monsters of self regard creatures of unalloyed self interest the terrible pain of loss teaches humility to our prideful kind has the power to soften uncaring hearts to make a better person of a good one
5755423 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
5755424 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5755425 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5755426 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5755427 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5755428 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5755429 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5755430 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5755431 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
5755432 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
5755433 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
5755434 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
5755435 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
5755436 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
5755437 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
5755438 mereka suka melibatkan diri dengan demonstrasi jalanan dan lain lain aktiviti politik yang memakan masa mereka di universiti
5755439 jika mahasiswa pada hari ini lebih matang dan bertanggungjawab batalkan saja auku
5755440 anytime there is missing information opinion turns into speculation and speculation turns into rumor
5755441 there were times when it hurt him deeply to see the same fans who had praised him three months earlier suddenly turn their backs on him
5755442 you throw the ball and hell find a way to come down with it
5755443 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
5755444 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
5755445 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
5755446 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
5755447 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
5755448 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
5755449 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites
5755450 id be remiss if i didnt say hello buddy cianci mayor of providence
5755451 i want you to know i was wearing my rhode island democrats t shirt when i was exercising this morning put that in the paper
5755452 i get amused when i see that stern faced young man from colorado extolling the merits of assault weapons
5755453 i didnt see any donkeys although we heard a weird sound when we first got in here
5755454 they must have you know seen me coming but they all hid somewhere
5755455 i dont care if you have jesus christ in the van

5755457 if my opponent had been there at the moon launch it would have been called a risky rocket scheme
5755458 if hed been there when edison was testing the light bulb it would have been a risky anti candle scheme
5755459 and if hed been there when the internet was invented
5755460 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body
5755461 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
5755462 they were all our first choices everyone said yes which is so rare

5755464 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
5755465 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
5755466 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
5755467 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
5755468 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
5755469 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
5755470 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5755471 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5755472 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5755473 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5755474 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5755475 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5755476 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5755477 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5755478 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5755479 the academy will serve as a regional center of excellence for capacity development for example in integrated water resources management utility management and water governance with a view to improving the delivery of water services through sustainable water sector strategies for advancing national economies of countries in the arab region

5755493 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
5755494 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
5755495 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
5755496 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four

5755501 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
5755502 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
5755503 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
5755504 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
5755505 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
5755506 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
5755507 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change

5755521 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
5755522 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain

5755564 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
5755565 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable

5755587 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
5755588 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy

5755602 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
5755603 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon

5755614 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
5755615 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
5755616 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly

5755627 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5755628 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5755629 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5755630 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming

5755813 the water didnt come into our shop on the high street but our customers were in caravans theyd had to move out of their homes who wants a freezer full of meat in a caravan and there was no barbecue season who wants a floating barbecue
5755814 our customers know its more economical to buy meat from us than the supermarket due to its superior quality and taste
5755815 we still have strong local trade but we knew there was potentially a nationwide market for high quality meat and we were really keen to continue to support british farmers
5755816 we only buy our fresh meat and poultry from british farms and wholesalers and source our produce locally wherever possible
5755817 this is because we strongly believe and our experience has shown that british meat and poultry is the best
5755818 with the uk becoming ever more health conscious people generally seem to be seeking more healthy and economical options
5755819 weve found that people want the convenience of a supermarket but the quality of the local butcher they are beginning to understand now that you can have fresh meat delivered and due to technological advances its quality is not going to suffer in transit
5755820 online meat trading is in its early years and many people still dont yet understand its possible trust from customers can be an issue with a website but we deliver what we say we will and customers come back
5755821 you can still buy quality meat and poultry with the friendly customer service that you get in a traditional butchers shop
5755822 whether youre in a busy city centre or out in the countryside you dont need to leave your armchair to get that sort of service anymore
5755823 people also appreciate the quality of traditional farm reared meat even in these days of tightened household budgets its not all about competing on price comparing what we deliver to supermarket meat can be a false economy its like comparing ford to mercedes

5755827 the xds new 2zr fe 1 8 liter four cylinder engine is toyotas first application of dual variable valve timing in a compact car
5755828 those who want ample acceleration from stop lights and on freeway on and off ramps
5755829 the steering for example is more isolated lacking feel to the point of numbness
5755830 its a nimble car with a strong emphasis on daily usability
5755831 fuel economy with both the manual and automatic transmissions is similar to the
5755832 good seat comfort and driver positioning but the seat lacks height adjustment and taller folks might find headroom and legroom tight
5755833 the seat is high set but entry and exit suffer from fairly narrow door openings limited legroom means even smaller passengers will be cramped
5755834 storage for odds and ends up front including an upper and lower glovebox on the passengers side
5755835 all of the xds square edges dont help with wind noise which at speed competes with road noise thats translated through relatively wide 195 60hr 16 tires
5755836 the engine buzzes under acceleration and theres lots of tire noise on all except smooth asphalt

5755847 fresh front end styling gives the 2008 subaru forester a bit more pizzazz
5755848 powerfully reminds me of our old turbo hoover vac the first tip off was the scoop on the foresters dippy exterior
5755849 gauges and controls are ordinary but sensibly arranged for ease of viewing and operation
5755850 plastics look a bit utilitarian the leather seats have an upscale look

5755853 non turbo models are tepid in highway speed passing and merging
5755854 base engine offers good punch and the turbo engine delivers its power in a sudden thrilling manner
5755855 with the turbocharged engine foresters are eager and frisky performers acceleration is especially snappy
5755856 non turbo models have adequate acceleration away from a stop but are tepid in highway speed passing and merging especially with cargo and several passengers aboard
5755857 plenty of power around town and on the highway throttle response is softened by turbo lag
5755858 a bit of turbo lag after pushing the gas pedal
5755859 even the base four cylinder engine offers good punch and the optional turbo engine delivers its power in a sudden thrilling manner that competitors v6 engines cant match
5755860 with the turbocharged engine foresters are eager and frisky performers acceleration is especially snappy
5755861 five speed manual gearbox is standard on all models except the 2 5 x l l bean edition which gets a four speed automatic transmission
5755862 a hill holder clutch on manual shift models makes it easier to start the car on inclines
5755863 an l l bean averaged 24 2 mpg in mostly highway driving while a test manual transmission xt averaged 23 2
5755864 increased ride height combined with all terrain tires can create unsettling moments but thats only because its bountiful thrust encourages you to drive the wheels off the thing
5755865 if you find a patch of dirt to play with enjoy a chassis that treats oversteer as a tool not an enemy
5755866 ride s pleasantly enough over smooth surfaces but bumps and ruts can produce somewhat harsh reactions
5755867 some jolting and body jiggle over sharp bumps and ridges but overall among the more comfortable compact suvs with good stability and control at highway speeds
5755868 with no low range gearing the awd system is not designed for off roading
5755869 on smooth surfaces the ride isnt bad though some choppiness and road vibration might be evident
5755870 fully independent strut type suspension has an appropriately firm tuning for a sport ride and very good handling
5755871 space is ample in the front and adequate in back knee space is less bountiful
5755872 so much road noise my 4 year old complains that the car is too loud
5755873 sport bucket seats in the front and a 60 40 split folding rear seat that can accommodate up to five occupants

5755912 i knew if i got a good start i could keep the lead
5755913 it felt like quite a good start but it obviously wasnt good enough he had three quarters of a length on me at the first corner
5755914 it was just a case of not making a mistake
5755915 its hard work to keep tim behind but i just stayed calm in the car
5755916 phil drove a very tight race where he needed to
5755917 thats an awesome achievement thats just what i wanted to do before the weekend

5755926 i cant say it was all enjoyable i wouldnt do it again but it has been incredible we were on ice roads virtually all the way from moscow thousands and thousands of miles and could not believe how much traction we got from the cooper tyres they were phenomenal
5755927 landing on wales was brilliant it was the culmination of nearly nine years work and to be the first to get across was incredible id watched other people before me try to do it rich people big companies and i thought how am i going to square up to these people but i showed them how its done
5755928 from the starting five that goes out to the rest of us who come off the bench
5755929 its like the energy never goes away if anything it picks up
5755930 we feel like we can bring our second wave of players
5755931 and a lot of times thats when game breaks open its not always because the first five arent doing a great job its because thats when fatigue sets in for another team sometimes its the first quarter our starters go hard for six seven minutes and then the other teams starters start to wear a little bit then we come in with fresh bodies that are just as good as the players we took out and now all of a sudden were able to stretch the lead out a little bit
5755932 they dont have any of the height that we have

5755948 it plays a huge role at domestic level and the injection of twenty20 has been fantastic for world cricket
5755949 perhaps domestically is where the target market for it is
5755950 internationally it is good to play a world tournament once every two years and to have a little international to almost launch your one day campaign
5755951 domestically it could be the lifeblood of the game and has a huge amount of relevance and importance there
5755952 but i dont think there should be overkill of twenty20 at international level simply because it is the lifeblood of the domestic game
5755953 overkill would take a little bit of the gloss off it so we have to watch out how much we expose it at international level
5755954 in a way we use this to sharpen up our disciplines ahead of friday
5755955 twenty20 is very much on its own as a lottery which can go either way
5755956 we fully regard the one day series as being five matches and that starts on friday

5755968 this change does not apply to software licenses for the windows server operating system client access licenses cals or management licenses mls

5755971 hamas and hizbollah make no bones about their determination to kill the jews but i have personally and publicly confronted msa leaders who will not condemn their vile deeds and poisonous agendas
5755972 this group has nothing in common with hillel the newman club or other such groups it may hide its agenda by posturing as a religious and cultural organization but it is a hardcore political organization committed to the goals of the muslim brotherhood and the radical islamic jihad
5755973 the msa is in fact an arm of the muslim brotherhood a terrorist organization which has created a network of front groups to conduct a stealth jihad in america this network includes cair the muslim american society and the islamic society of north america
5755974 stable organizations that are connected with our movement and which fly in our orbit

5756092 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odors
5756093 when women are pregnant theres no selection pressure evolutionarily speaking for having a preference for genetically dissimilar odors
5756094 and if there is any pressure at all it would be towards relatives who would be more genetically similar because the relatives would help those individuals rear the baby

5756105 underage drinking is an adult problem and more specifically parents play a key role in educating their children well before peer pressure begins
5756106 we look forward to working with nationwide to help curb this dangerous trend

5756110 it may seem strange that transporting our unwanted paper and plastic bottles such a distance would actually be better for the environment but that is what the evidence from this study shows

5756112 although this study is only part of the environmental impact story it is clear that there are significant co2 savings that can be made by shipping our unwanted paper and plastic to china

5756142 i have nothing against stevie gerrard who i had the pleasure of playing with on his debut or rio
5756143 they are both great players but john terry can organise it and lead better than anyone else
5756144 had a very different way of doing things very in house

5756190 last week the governments four week moving average of first time claims for unemployment increased to its highest level since april 2002
5756191 this suggests that job market conditions are likely to continue to deteriorate in the months ahead employers are unlikely to build their employee workforces given the slowing economy the end of the tax rebates and all of the factors potentially affecting consumer spending in a negative way including energy prices housing and the consumer credit crunch as a result employed americans worries about their personal job situations may tend to increase as the remainder of this year unfolds
5756192 on the other hand the sharp drop in oil and gas prices over the past 30 days has had a positive impact on consumer confidence
5756193 as a result the real question for the economy looking ahead including the all important christmas shopping season seems to be whether declining gas prices even though they remain far above year ago levels will be enough not only to offset further deterioration in the jobs market but also to increase consumers real disposable incomes enough to significantly stimulate consumer spending at this point it appears the downward momentum in the jobs market may be hard to reverse in time for the christmas holidays

5756415 the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
5756416 use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election
5756417 we have lost over a thousand american lives and spent billions of dollars since the surge began but iraqs leaders still havent made hard compromises or substantial investments in rebuilding their country

5756433 a spirit of self vindication runs counter to the gospel and is more in keeping with a legal spirit
5756434 to harden the profane and foment divisions among weak christians and raise in them a dislike at pure gospel ordinances
5756435 their esteem of and regard for the authority of the church
5756436 all who preach a gospel of grace and christian freedom will be slandered
5756437 now a days 1726 the gospel is brought under much disparagement under much suspicion as if it were some new dangerous scheme of doctrine as the athenians said of paul acts xvii 19 yea it was said of christ what new doctrine is this such is the natural bias towards the law as a covenant and so natively does a church and people fall into it even after and under profession of sound principles that when evangelical doctrine comes to be revived in any measure it is still branded with novelty
5756438 let us not be deterred from gospel principles it is better to be under the reproach of men for following christ than to be under the curse of god for forsaking him

5756547 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5756548 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5756549 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5756550 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5756551 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5756552 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5756553 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5756554 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5756555 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5756556 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5756557 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice

5756559 this is the first time that a major brand has introduced a low abv offering to the cider market in the uk and we are convinced that this will unlock a whole new range of occasions where magners can be enjoyed
5756560 when i go around and i talk to people there is frustration and there is anger and there is bitterness and whats worse is when people are expressing their anger then politicians try to say what are you angry about this just happened i want to make a point here today
5756561 i was in san francisco talking to a group at a fundraiser and somebody asked howre you going to get votes in pennsylvania
5756562 well look theyre frustrated and for good reason because for the last 25 years theyve seen jobs shipped overseas theyve seen their economies collapse they have lost their jobs they have lost their pensions they have lost their healthcare
5756563 and for 25 30 years democrats and republicans have come before them and said were going to make your community better
5756564 out of touch out of touch i mean john mccain it took him three tries to finally figure out that the home foreclosure crisis was a problem and to come up with a plan for it and hes saying im out of touch senator clinton voted for a credit card sponsored bankruptcy bill that made it harder for people to get out of debt after taking money from the financial services companies and she says im out of touch no im in touch i know exactly whats going on i know whats going on in pennsylvania i know whats going on in indiana i know whats going on in illinois people are fed up theyre angry and theyre frustrated and theyre bitter and they want to see a change in washington and thats why im running for president of the united states of america
5756565 there will come the day whether locked into the vendor or not that customers will come together and say no more i absolutely believe that to be a reality

5756575 its just really exciting three of the tracks have got two drummers on me and zak starkey playing drums some of it sounds a bit glam theres no pop singles on it id be amazed if anything else gets on the radio past the first single
5756576 theres a kind of piano y john lennon y obligatory plod away song in the middle which liam wrote

5756580 the dncc community credentials incorporate patriotic design elements they do not depict an actual american flag the dncc has full and complete respect for the flag and all rules of display
5756581 we do not teach that in china or in the u s
5756582 they just wanted to close the case to some innocent guy
5756583 i feel sorry for him because if people didnt see the other side of the story theyre gonna think this guy is the rapist and its just like you know anyone related to that theres a stigma attached thats why i think i dont want my face anywhere i dont want to be a target either i feel sorry for that guy that wrongfully accused hes a target
5756584 i was like i was kinda shocked i was like that cant be right cause youd never expect a filipino to do something like that
5756585 i think its a grey area because in one sense theyre looking out for safety and their not letting the risk of safety and a pedophile and rapist be out there but at the same time what about that guy his lifes somewhat destroyed because of it
5756586 the attack apparently the result of a dispute over the younger sister of one of de mesas friends left pravneel singh with cheek and skull fractures and bleeding into the fluid surrounding his brain
5756587 but after leaving the bar de mesa was seen speaking on his mobile phone to a friend who reportedly told de mesa his sister had been assaulted by mr singh and urged something be done about it de mesa told police he had not really kicked mr singh and was only tapping or nudging him to check on his condition

5756589 when i dare to be powerful to use my strength in the service of my vision then it becomes less and less important whether i am afraid
5756590 if you havent attained clear true vision this causes you to lapse into extremes so that you lose contact with reality
5756591 the most pathetic person in the world is someone who has sight but has no vision
5756592 the most elusive and desired quality of leadership is vision vision is the perfume of the mind
5756593 we are not getting as many guests during this olympic period as everyone expected
5756594 maybe it is because more hotels have opened maybe its because hotels have greatly increased their room rates
5756595 the benefits of the number of people attending the games is expected to be largely offset by reduced business activity during the olympic period
5756596 it was more difficult to visit and come to the games because of visa issues
5756597 of the greater certainty provided by being part of a larger organization is considerable
5756598 the a amp l board sees no obvious circumstances that are likely materially to improve conditions in the financial markets or the broader economic outlook in the near to medium term and has concluded that there is a risk of external events further eroding shareholder value
5756599 i know why labour is using it ive seen the focus groups too people like the word fair
5756600 they think government is unfair to those who work hard and play by the rules they want a fair deal and fair play
5756601 and when youre in trouble as a political party there is a temptation to cling desperately to the words that focus groups throw up
5756602 i remember an attempted conservative relaunch in 2003 was based on the theme a fair deal for everyone it was not a great success indeed we lost our party leader that autumn
5756603 we are currently on course to leave that next generation a higher national debt and the highest budget deficit of any major economy in the world
5756604 and far from changing course all the leaks and briefings coming out of the downing street at the moment suggest that the prime minister is preparing to try to buy his way out of trouble by bribing people with their own borrowed money
5756605 leaving our children to pay our debts is not fair we already know that we face a rising bill over the years to come from our ageing population
5756606 to add to the bill gross fiscal irresponsibility is not just economically reckless it is deeply unfair on future generations
5756607 we need to develop a new fiscal framework to replace the busted fiscal rules that were supposed to protect us from the short term spending sprees of politicians out to save their own skin a framework that fairly protects the interests of the next generation
5756608 we have discovered that state attempts to guarantee fairness through monopoly provision by monolithic public services turns out to be as unfair as previous ideas of 98 tax rates and forced equality of outcome
5756609 so if monopoly state provision is not the answer what is
5756610 evidence from around the world shows that just as a broad consensus now exists that we should be free to make our own choices and to innovate in the private sphere so we must trust choice competition in provision and local decision making in public services
5756611 the labour party is delighted that the battle is to be joined on fairness when we are fighting a tory party that for all the talk of change is still committed to the old unfair policies
5756612 this is the same tory party that opposed the minimum wage opposed pension credit and the winter fuel allowance opposed support for families through tax credits and still wont commit to any real pledge on child poverty and this is the same shadow chancellor whose flagship tax policy diverts 1bn to the 3 000 richest estates in the country

5756646 effectively the changes mean instead of counting instances or processors and licensing by server you are able to count instances or processors and license by server farm
5756647 this change does not apply to software licenses for the windows server operating system client access licenses cals or management licenses mls
5756648 microsoft great move today i think many enterprises will appreciate the application licensing flexibility that your policy change has provided still lets not forget about the small it shops that do not have volume licenses why restrict server os mobility lifting the 90 day licensing transfer restriction across all product lines is simply the right thing to do
5756649 the shit he did thats what got me into heavy music vulgar display of power i was only into eighties music before that the heaviest thing i listened to was skinny puppy and ministry but that wasnt metal when i heard vulgar display i was like holy shit what the fuck is this the first time i ever saw them live before korn was even signed me and fieldy korn bassist went and it was pantera and sepultura at irving meadows in l a they came out started the first song the curtain dropped and me and fieldy just started crying we looked at each other and we had tears in our eyes because it was so fucking intense and heavy and sick
5756650 i always compare it to when steve perry went and did oh sherrie which is a fucking journey song
5756651 it sounded exactly like journey and thats fucked up i dont want to do that
5756652 i feel like im waving the flag for musicianship trying to bring back bands that can play
5756653 it seems like a lot of music today is so churned out and simple i like playing these festivals because its one thing all day and then here i come on and everyones like whoa then back to the grind
5756654 it sounds like a banjo but they sing with it and its the most fucking passionate emotional music ive ever heard in my life
5756655 i want to include that in my album because its so passionate like when you hear a korn song and its really going crazy these guys do it with a stringy banjo i want to bring that to kids here who are like what the fuck is this and open their minds up to something different

5756681 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering in the united states fusing the deadly genome of the 1918 pandemic misnamed the spanish flu with the dna of the innocuous h5n1 virus in a growth medium of human kidney cells according to the national institutes of health and the vaccines manufacturer some virologists believe that this would insure that the man made mutant virus recognizes human cells and knows how to invade them

5756706 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy so basically i had a prophylactic double mastectomies

5756737 this should benefit cmi through increased content per vehicle in 2010
5756738 our announcement last week that we are going to add scr to our engine configuration in the 2010 heavy duty products wasnt an admission that our previous path wasnt working but rather a recognition that adding scr to the technology recipe would yield better fuel economy while achieving the necessary emissions standards
5756739 the fact that were willing to make a hard decision relatively late in the game is a sign of the confidence we have that we can deliver a more fuel efficient product to customers on time in 2010 as we have promised

5756869 hey everybody check out our new expensive police communication system its mighty powerful why i bet its radio signals could reach almost 30 miles away
5756870 hmm anyone around here have the instruction manual for our new expensive sprinkler system we spent 5 million on the thing and it working look at how dry those medians and city parks are
5756871 even though were only in the testing phase we can tell the 1 3 million we spent on our radio signals was worth it we cant wait to put it to use lets activate it this month
5756872 seriously it should work the brochure said the specific radio signal would tell each sprinkler when to come on and for how long whats up
5756873 say cedar hill desoto and duncanville do you mind not using your new expensive police communications system we think its interfering with our sprinklers if not we have to reprogram all 539 sprinkers by hand itll cost about 250 000
5756874 too bad we like our system and its important which comes first watering plants or protecting police and fire
5756875 cant we negotiate maybe you guys could delay your launch and give us time to make some upgrades

5756882 recently an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three
5756883 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognizing and representing numerosities the number of objects in a set and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks that do not require number words
5756884 in our tasks we couldnt for example ask questions such as
5756885 do these two sets have the same number of objects
5756886 thus basic numerical concepts do indeed appear to depend on an innate mechanism this may help explain why children in numerate cultures with developmental dyscalculia find it so difficult to learn arithmetic although they have plenty of formal and informal opportunities to learn to count with words and do arithmetic the innate mechanism on which skilled arithmetic is based may have developed atypically
5756887 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson

5756959 based on current epidemiological evidence there is no justification for excluding donors on the basis of whether they have had oral sex
5756960 it would seem prudent to defer donors who have had male anal sex without a condom for a donor who has had anal sex only with a condom the risk is far lower
5756961 we have a very strong and robust system which we can change to reduce risk increase the volume of blood and remove unnecessary prejudice and discrimination

5756985 this agreement achieves our major objectives of providing quality jobs adequate health care and wage and pension increases for our members

5756990 from what we have been told eli was actually making a profit and doing quite well
5756991 im really quite surprised that a small city like santa cruz would want to lose something as valuable as this
5756992 it is correct in that they had met the targets they have done a really good job
5756993 unfortunately the program is extremely expensive to run every time they generated more income they were generating more expenses
5756994 the university should forgive the debt not only in the name of continued education services but in the name of saving jobs
5756995 in the heart of campus i dont think they want to lose us

5757010 penso alle sfide degli anni 90 contro il napoli di maradona sono stati anni di splendide sfide ricordo lattenzione che ci voleva per maradona era troppo piu forte degli altri per fermarlo a volte ci voleva qualche scorrettezza

5757042 conduct research and be more organized about looking for rates
5757043 this is a solid example of good fantastical short fiction and an issue of
5757044 the main difference between my informal education at home and my formal education at college has been that at home i can focus on what i want to learn when i want to learn it
5757045 there were never any lessons at home or anything structured for more than a couple of weeks
5757046 days go by in the same way that they would in the summer holidays for other children
5757047 one of my children might be outdoors with the chickens another may be looking after the pets and the third may be on the computer
5757048 the ease naturalness and immense intellectual potential of informal learning up to the age of middle secondary school means they can learn certainly as much if not more
5757049 doing nothing observing having conversations exploring and through self directed learning
5757050 its products are often intangible its processes obscure its progress piecemeal
5757051 there are false starts unrelated bits and pieces picked up interests followed and discarded sometimes to be taken up again sometimes not yet the chaotic nature of the informal curriculum does not appear to be a barrier to children organising it into a coherent body of knowledge
5757052 yet the lack of information quality control does not appear to lead to muddled confused children
5757053 in some ways it may be an advantage because rather than presenting knowledge in neat packages the informal curriculum forces learners to become actively engaged with their information to work with it move it around juggle ideas and resolve contradictions it is not a static thing contained in a series of educational folders it is alive and dynamic
5757054 i provide materials resources help with research discuss what they are reading and what i am reading watch documentaries with them have stimulating conversations listen a lot and answer questions

5757056 she came to appreciate the value of material goods but she did not see it like that
5757057 she saw only the concrete activity if she did sometimes count money or do sums in her head it was her decision sparked by her emerging understanding or simple curiosity about numbers
5757058 the point is that maths certainly most of what is acquired at the primary level can be learned as an integral part of everyday concrete activities in school maths has to be divorced from the dynamic realities of everyday life
5757059 there is no developmental or educational logic behind the radical change in pedagogy from informal to formal when children start school
5757060 the young people had the personal skills to make the transition with apparent ease
5757061 the curriculum opens up a number of ways we can understand it history science art maths its very important that we give all young people the opportunity to engage with all subjects whether they immediately occur to them or their parents or not schools have developed ways of condensing canons of literature for example and introducing it in sequence to children
5757062 its very important that parents have the option to home educate their children but i wouldnt advise it

5757109 el amor nunca se va a gastar y si encuentras nuevas formas de hablar sobre el amor puedes encontrar nuevas formas de hablar sobre crep sculo pero no creo que crep sculo sea tan poderoso como lo es harry potter crepusculo es sobre el amor y ser adolescente y preguntarse si uno encaja y harry potter es sobre mucho m s que eso
5757110 para nosotros es una comunidad m s que un g nero musical y no s si ellos ya tienen un sentido de comunidad si todos se juntan si las bandas son tan unidas como lo somos nosotros
5757111 s lo es un mont n de romance y mordeduras

5757116 when i read shibani bhatijas script i knew that it had to be sanjay dutt for the role he plays the richest indian in the world whose daughter minissha is kidnapped by imran even for sanju it is a unique role

5757126 it has been brought to our attention that some of anwars supporters have gone overseas to drum up support from ngos there
5757127 the government should consider reviewing its policy regarding the hiring of foreign workers if it finds foreigners involving themselves in our politics

5757154 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5757155 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5757156 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca

5757159 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5757160 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5757161 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5757162 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5757163 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5757164 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5757165 that the obama campaign has chosen to portray me as a 9 11 truther just shows how sloppy and inaccurate the research going into their rebuttal was

5757167 let it happen but made it worse with controlled demolition
5757168 after the review of my draft article by the wnd editorial staff i agreed the piece should be withdrawn
5757169 as i explained on the radio i am typically interested in scientific evidence that lies outside the explanation of conventional hypotheses
5757170 science advances by rejecting hypotheses not by establishing hypotheses in other words should somebody find convincing scientific evidence that challenges some aspect of any official report that evidence will not automatically confirm the truth of an alternative hypothesis

5757246 the amount of ice lost by greenland over the last year is the equivalent of two times all the ice in the alps or a layer of water more than one half mile deep covering washington d c
5757247 the more lubrication there is under the ice the faster that ice moves to the coast
5757248 those glaciers with floating ice tongues also will increase in iceberg production
5757249 the bigger question is how much water is reaching the bed of the ice sheet and how quickly it gets there
5757250 inclusion of the dynamic processes of these glaciers in models will likely demonstrate that the 2007 intergovernmental panel on climate change assessment underestimated sea level projections for the end of the 21st century

5757340 the monitoring and compliance requirements in todays corporate computing environment involve enormous data sets across all layers of the network
5757341 the event aggregation correlation response and archival capabilities of the arcsight siem platform combined with the audit and compliance solutions from mcafee enable our security and network engineers to respond much more quickly to a full range of security threats and compliance violations we are pleased to see these category leaders combine their products in new and useful ways
5757342 the ability to quickly detect and mitigate threats or compliance violations and minimize the associated business risk is a business imperative
5757343 as leaders in our respective segments of the security industry we believe that mcafee and arcsight together offer a comprehensive end to end risk mitigation solution we anticipate that our partnership with mcafee will dramatically reduce the cycle time from detection to response while offering companies continuous compliance oversight
5757344 we are excited to welcome arcsight into the mcafee security innovation alliance
5757345 the arcsight event management and log management offerings are very complementary to the mcafee portfolio but more importantly we believe that the way that we are tightly integrating them with epo will help our joint customers reduce their total cost of security and compliance operations

5757400 turns out the former site of the south central farm where low income indigenous immigrant latino farmers grew food in the midst of a toxic industrial area for 14 years before being evicted two summers ago in one of the saddest most maddening examples of private business interests trumping community and environmental good that ive ever personally witnessed is being developed as a forever 21 warehouse
5757401 mayor villaraigosa who championed the farms preservation two years ago is staying out of the latest fight he has received nearly 1 3 million in contributions and commitments from forever 21 and its executives over the past two years for initiatives ranging from tree plantings to his own reelection campaign

5757476 generally pdf files are separated into distinct folders by a single topic such as fmri or evidence based imaging this approach however does not address the problem of classification of multisubject articles

5757478 itunes has powerful search and sort functions it can remember a users favorite articles it supports customized shortcuts for different topics or categories and the backup of these shortcuts can be easily achieved

5757505 the uspto continues to support the pilot of peer review to help it fulfill its promise as a way to help get the best prior art expeditiously before the examiner extending and expanding the pilot to include business method patent applications will add more participants to the pilot and help us and the public better assess the effectiveness of peer review
5757506 im pleased to announce the new center which will lead the way in reforming the international patent system
5757507 cpi will become a pioneer in the patent field helping to create an environment of participation with patent examiners scientists and knowledgeable experts thereby improving the understanding and effectiveness of patent systems establishing the center for patent innovations was a natural progression for the peer to patent project
5757508 peer to patent has demonstrated that opening the patent process to input from the public can improve governmental decision making
5757509 we are happy to help new york law school continue its pioneering work to create systems that lead to more informed decisions about patentability by funding the development of the center for patent innovations
5757510 i kissed a girl and i liked it i hope my boyfriend dont mind it

5757512 the uspto continues to support the peer review pilot to help it fulfill its promise as a way to help get the best prior art expeditiously before the examiner
5757513 extending and expanding the pilot to include business method patent applications will add more participants to the pilot and help us and the public better assess the effectiveness of peer review
5757514 we support the peer review pilot and commend the usptos decision to expand the program to include financial sector innovation which has been one of the most difficult areas to locate relevant prior art
5757515 expansion of the pilot into class 705 will allow the office to access considerable industry expertise and holds promise for improving patent quality and the shortening of long pendency times
5757516 i dreamt about this day since i was a little girl on a ranch in alaska

5757522 it was mostly ad libbed with russell asking her for advice about hosting the show theres also a 9 000 pound elephant in it as in the elephant in the room
5757523 i am confident these early results will help validate that this community approach can have a meaningful impact on the examination process and the quality of patents
5757524 should become an integral part of best practice patent examination
5757525 the uspto will work tirelessly to ensure high quality agency actions but we must make progress to ensure examiners are presented with applications that clearly depict the claimed invention and relevant prior art is presented to the examiner in a timely manner
5757526 consistent with director dudas direction to encourage focused and complete information that allows examiners to make the best decisions when examining applications the uspto has initiated a number of improvements to better focus the examination process these include
5757527 patents of questionable merit are of little value to anyone
5757528 a computer implemented method for manipulating objects in a user interface comprising providing the user interface including a first interface object operable ot be selected and moved within the user interface and in response to selection and movement of the first interface object in the user interface presenting at least one additional interface object in the user interface in proximity of the first interface object each additional interface object representing a drop target with which the first object may be associated

5757531 cannot fully investigate academic papers and manuals that are not included in databases
5757532 i hope other patent applicants look at the processing statistics from this pilot program and realize that peer to patent review might be a win win situation for them we are encouraged by the initial success of the pilot and we believe it holds potential as a source of relevant prior art
5757533 it is a privilege to participate in this important project
5757534 im confident these early results will help validate that this community approach can have a meaningful impact on the examination process and the quality of patents hopefully this will encourage the participation of more domain experts in this pilot program
5757535 it is to everyones benefit inventor investor and the public at large to make the best possible effort to ensure that issued patents are properly placed in the context of related prior art in the future i think that an open mediated review process following the trail blazed by peer to patent should become an integral part of best practice patent examination
5757536 patents of questionable merit are of little value to anyone we much prefer that the best prior art be identified so that the resulting patent is truly bulletproof this is precisely why we eagerly agreed to sponsor this project and other patent quality initiatives we are proud of this result which validates the concept of peer to patent and can only improve the quality of patents produced by the patent system

5757596 how will you explain to him about his real parents
5757597 but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be added to you
5757598 you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind
5757599 the second is like it you shall love your neighbor as yourself
5757600 and jesus came up and spoke to them saying all authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth
5757601 but like the holy one who called you be holy yourselves also in all your behavior
5757602 but grow in the grace and knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ to him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity amen
5757603 1praise the lord how blessed is the man who fears the lord who greatly delights in his commandments 2his descendants will be mighty on earth the generation of the upright will be blessed
5757604 commit your works to the lord and your plans will be established
5757605 now faith is the assurance of things hoped for the conviction of things not seen
5757606 for you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out
5757607 so that he might redeem those who were under the law that we might receive the adoption as sons
5757608 if we confess our sins he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
5757609 so the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man and he slept then he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh at that place the lord god fashioned into a woman the rib which he had taken from the man and brought her to the man the man said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman for this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother and be joined to his wife and they shall become one flesh
5757610 yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of god but was strengthened in his fiath and gave glory to god being fully persuaded that god had power to do what he had promised
5757611 commit your works to the lord and your plans will be established

5757651 as a leading global solar provider sharp is proud to be part of this tremendous effort to help denver achieve its ambitious sustainability goals this solar pv system will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions electricity costs and grid constraints while helping to improve denvers air quality and the regions overall environment
5757652 this installation at denver international airport fits with our greenprint denver action agenda for sustainability and our pledge to do all that we can to reduce our carbon footprint
5757653 we are proud to have such a large and prominently placed solar power system at dia this installation is both a symbol and a practical example of the citys commitment to renewable energy
5757654 dia has a long standing commitment to sustainable operations and environmental protection this project makes a visible environmental statement to the millions of passengers that travel through our airport
5757655 we are delighted that such a major metropolitan airport as denver international has embarked on a solar energy system that is as impressive in scope as this two megawatt installation which is the equivalent in size to seven football fields in addition our expertise in designing and installing commercial scale solar systems enabled us to address the complex power needs of a major transportation hub like denver international
5757656 by securing power through a power purchase agreement rather than major capital investment dia will benefit from a renewable energy system that is cost effective from its very first day of operation and for years to come
5757657 our collaborative effort serves as an example of how successful public private partnerships can help municipal facilities make the most of tax credits and other incentives available for solar energy
5757658 as a leading global solar provider sharp is proud to be part of this tremendous effort to help denver achieve its ambitious sustainability goals this solar pv system will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions electricity costs and grid constraints while helping to improve denvers air quality and the regions overall environment

5757690 trendgraphix also notes 23 of the homes for sale are bank repos
5757691 authorities have seen improvements in the macro level environment as well as in the stock market so they made the decision
5757692 a bigger trading band helps the market increase rapidly but can also cause prompt declines
5757693 the economy has seen some improvement but hasnt been as good as it was some years ago
5757694 since inflation has been curbed and world oil and gold prices have fallen significantly investors can believe in the good prospects of the economy in the final months of the year
5757695 however lending rates hovering around 20 per cent per year are a big hindrance to the market
5757696 the main thing im hoping for three weeks away from the semis is that we dont continually limp our way through the next three weeks and struggle when we get there
5757697 to be so good for 20 weeks it would be a shame now to undo all that as it would for the roosters
5757698 were both struggling a bit i think we spoke about five weeks ago about geez were in a good position could be top four and since then weve struggled a bit
5757699 they were brilliant for the first 12 14 weeks and maybe both of us have hit the wall
5757700 three weeks out its time to get some red cordial and have some coffee and do whatever you can to get a bit excited
5757701 we have to stand up and win games big games on the big stage and unfortunately weve let ourselves down in games like manly and brisbane
5757702 we just have to learn to handle it if were going to go good in the semi finals
5757703 unfortunately theres only a few of us who have played semi final football
5757704 the build up to the manly game had a semi final feel about it and maybe shellshocked a few of the boys so hopefully were a little bit more used to it now and we can handle it a bit better this week
5757705 right now im stoked to get another medal especially in a field like this
5757706 i have to pay my respect to my team mates and other guys who were out there and sacrificed their race for us
5757707 hes refusing to sign the conditions the judge imposed on him yesterday
5757708 his attorney made it clear he was going to agree to the new terms
5757709 some black guy who came up on my porch selling crack and i just shot him in the head
5757710 everybody said the market would turn positive in july before the games so we listened and stayed in it
5757711 in july they said that the markets spirit would return when the olympics came what spirit is that now we are all dead and have no spirit left in the market
5757712 people just dont have a strong will to invest in the market
5757713 theres no logic to follow no other market falls as badly and accidentally as ours
5757714 it should be good now with the olympics inflation going down but that has nothing to do with the market in china i am so deeply trapped there is nothing i can do my account used to have 32 000 and now its only something like 8 800
5757715 i dont think this case necessarily lends itself to that conclusion
5757716 its not uncommon for players to try to exit a contract part way through their deal and for them to have to pay a sum of money but that case williams is high profile and unusual
5757717 ill take a stab and say that youd get two or three of these cases a year that we would deal with in those cases wed say look guys the player wants to move on and whats it going to take to make that happen
5757718 our view is that you should always try and work through these things amicably sure you can try and walk out on your contract but you run the risk of lawsuits and not everyone has the same financial backing to challenge those as toulon appear to have
5757719 theyve got a salary cap over there for a start and even without a salary cap they couldnt be paying that kind of compensation
5757720 obviously toulon seem to have that luxury of a reasonably endless supply of funds but im just judging that from the outside
5757721 i can see some players looking at this and saying i want to get out of my contract and thats a path i could try
5757722 put it this way we wouldnt be advising any player that we represent to go about things that way
5757723 we still havent decided just how well go with the bench
5757724 were still looking at it and will make a decision later
5757725 for whatever reason we havent won there so far and it wont be any easier this time not after the dragons knocked over the broncos in brisbane last week
5757726 it was a good opportunity while it lasted we have never had anything like this before with most of the new zealand girls playing together now its gone and may not come back im really disappointed
5757727 we knew they always had issues with funding but you always hoped for the best

5757731 if the only tool you have is a hammer then everything looks like a nail
5757732 the change may mean more assessments of the situation but time is running out to stage the event or move it elsewhere
5757733 yes i have resigned from the post and it is now the prerogative of the new president of the country to appoint a new chairman of the pakistan cricket board pcb
5757734 i will continue to work until a new chairman is appointed and i dont see my leaving affecting the champions trophy because pcb is an institution and institutions are not run by individuals

5757926 private messages and to do lists were a godsend for one client this was a particularly challenging project for an extremely difficult client private messaging in basecamp gives us control of our clients perception of their project while still allowing us to be explicit with its nitty gritty parts all in one convenient place sometimes the work gets a little ugly but keeping a professional facade is extremely important to some clients basecamp accommodates this nicely

5757939 theres a pressure among retailers to constantly give consumers something new consumers are now very sophisticated and trend aware especially because h amp m and forever 21 have made trend surfing accessible to everyone fast fashion brands are able to pinpoint up and coming trends and react very quickly to them theres a higher expectation for small retailers to keep up with all the options

5757973 bill pullman is talking about wine the grape has to struggle and the dirt has to be dry for the wine to be good but thats a lovely metaphor for all artists actors painters candlestick makers there needs to be struggle conflict and evolution
5757974 transformers was important and defining for me because it taught me about what kinds of movies i want to make and the kind of actor i want to be and i have a long way to go before i become that actor

5757982 it had been through the whole process of checking rivers agency were happy with it we were happy with it and the roads service were happy with the design we put forward or else nobody would have signed on it nobody anticipated the amount of rain we had and i dont think the finger pointing is going to help we just have to see how we are going to get over this problem and prevent it in the future
5757983 the decision to realign the clowney river to the south of the underpass rather than integrate it into the roof slab has been a major factor in allowing us to reprogramme the work to finish this part early this allowed us to deal more efficiently with numerous overhead and underground services and keep traffic running during the construction
5757984 the chinese boxer other finalist zou shiming beat barnes convincingly in the world championships in chicago last year
5757985 the notion that christianity in general and evangelicalism in particular are by nature right wing creeds has always been wrong how can a faith built around a commitment to the poor and the vulnerable be seen as leading ineluctably to conservative political conclusions

5757988 they might think they are being smart issuing that type of answer but it is showing that they are burying their heads in the sand many members have been very positive about the suggestion internally but nothing has happened at an official level yet
5757989 were a pro protestant organisation not an anti catholic one were an all ireland body and we have members in nine counties in the republic
5757990 the biennial pew research center report on changing news audiences describes 13 of the us public as
5757991 remarkably at a time when nearly all newspapers are losing sales and celebrity and mens magazines are reporting significant circulation losses the cerebral weeklies and monthlies continue to grow in the first half of this year the circulation of the oldie climbed 15 5 per cent to 28 862 compared with the same period last year the spectator rose 5 1 per cent to 76 952 the uk sale of the economist grew by 5 6 per cent year on year to 182 539 the week was up 4 5 per cent at 150 099 and prospects circulation rose 10 7 per cent to 27 552

5757998 it does not appear to be new semtex so it does not raise a concern with me that they have a new supply of semtex
5757999 it is significant in the sense that there was semtex in the explosive charge it did not go off but there was semtex there where it came from i dont know
5758000 it is similar to devices that used to be used in the province by other groups
5758001 but when it semtex was passed over to different groups how it came to be in their possession i dont know at this point in time

5758003 in the decade up to 2006 residential property prices in ireland rose more rapidly than in any other developed economy strong demand partly explains this incomes employment and population all grew robustly the increase in the supply of new housing was just as phenomenal the number of annual housing completions in 2006 was almost five times that of the early 1990s which compares with static output in the euro area and in the uk however when supply and demand fundamentals are considered in tandem the enormous increase in prices was unjustified consequently the countrys property market is now going sharply into reverse prices have been falling for 18 months and excess supply makes further declines all but inevitable in the event of an even sharper correction than is currently predicted the main lenders would probably suffer badly although irelands banks have been highly profitable over a long period and are thus well capitalised they are hugely exposed to the domestic property market the international credit crisis should it continue could cause serious financing problems for the banks adding to concerns about their balance sheets

5758012 martin the police did not plant the bomb your former associates did
5758013 he wanted to come round to the house to pay his respects but i didnt want that and we met in the hotel since then we have communicated intermittently over the years and i did meet him with gerry adams and gerry kelly but that meeting was not a terribly good one
5758014 nothing came of it and i was very disappointed by the response from adams in particular on friday i decided to send a text to martin mcguinness to again ask him to give that vital assistance and urge his fellow republicans to give the information that would convict the bombers but again he wouldnt agree to that but when sinn fein does take that step it will show that they are genuinely into peace and a system of justice which should protect everybody catholic and protestant

5758045 what is a promise worth when it is not fulfilled
5758046 russian military action has been disproportionate and inconsistent with its peacekeeping role as well as incompatible with the principles of peaceful conflict resolution we cannot continue with business as usual
5758047 today nato demonstrated that it originated in and it is still from the time of the cold war it doesnt matter what their propaganda says
5758048 georgian president mikheil saakashvili got the right to start a war against the small people of south ossetia just because georgia had nato aspirations
5758049 the us was greatly involved in the preparation of this georgian aggression and here in brussels they were afraid to engage in a frank discussion with russia in the presence of their european allies

5758078 our school is quite strict when we stay in school we cant go out on our own let alone when were at a military camp
5758079 north korea is no 1 in the world when it comes to uniformity they are uniform beyond belief these kind of traditional synchronized movements result in a sense of beauty we chinese are able to achieve this as well though hard training and strict discipline
5758080 in one week we could only work four and a half days we had to have coffee breaks twice a day couldnt go into overtime and just a little discomfort was not allowed because of human rights
5758081 you could not criticize them either they all belong to some organizations they have all kind of institutions unions we do not have that we can work very hard can withstand lots of bitterness we can achieve in one week what they can achieve in one month
5758082 at one point the children had to run in four different directions when one fell others quickly followed
5758083 we had only two meals for the entire time there was almost no time to sleep even less time for toilet breaks
5758084 but we didnt feel so angry because the director was also there with us the whole time
5758085 all the tears the sweat and sometimes even blood that we shed i now think it was quite worth it

5758088 dieses ereignis brachte uns allein 210 mio zuschauer im fernsehen und jeden abend etwa 5000 besucher auf der trib ne die uns weitere einnahmen bescherten
5758089 damit ist es schwerer zu kalkulieren und das umsatzziel zu erreichen
5758090 im ersten jahr streben wir immer eine auslastung von ber 95 prozent an im zweiten wollen wir an die 90 prozent herankommen diese marke werden wir 2008 sogar bertreffen nachdem wir auch gegen eventuelle ausf lle versichert sind k nnen wir schon jetzt sagen dass wir unsere ziele bertroffen haben tosca d rfte sich damit im zweiten jahr etwa so gut wie im ersten entwickelt haben
5758091 wir m ssen mit der oper auf dem see im minimum 20 mio
5758092 deshalb brauchen und erreichen wir eine umsatzrendite von 30 bis 40 prozent
5758093 wir kommen auf eine eigendeckung inklusive sponsorenzuwendungen und rechteverwertungen z b tv bertragungen auf 75 bis 80 prozent wobei der sponsorenanteil etwa 10 prozent ausmacht der rest des budgets etwa 5 5 mio euro pro jahr kommt aus seit 1997 konstanten ffentlichen zusch ssen
5758094 uns kommt zugute dass wir nicht f r ein komplettes jahr orchester ballett oder ein gro es team von technikern unterhalten m ssen sondern wir bezahlen die engagements nur f r die spielsaison dies bedeutet wir haben niedrigere fixkosten als opernh user
5758095 wir loten jedes jahr aus sichern wir uns mit einer versicherung ab oder gehen wir ins eigene risiko dabei haben wir in all den jahren ein gutes gef hl entwickelt

5758098 i was really happy with aguero today he scored two goals and he played fantastic
5758099 this team has committed themselves to each match at the olympics to try and win the gold medal
5758100 this is what they will continue to do against nigeria in the final nigeria is a really strong team we want to savour this win over brazil first
5758101 of course this will put more pressure and there will be some doubts about me as the coach and the team but i have faith in my work and in my players
5758102 we will evaluate this defeat and look into the problem areas and we will study everything this is what happens in football sometimes you win sometimes you lose but the most important thing is we have to put our heart into it

5758104 dont let it worry you just yet it could be a while
5758105 but i am worried i mean what if something happens to you

5758118 the uk has one of the toughest borders in the world and we are determined to ensure it stays that way
5758119 our hi tech electronic borders system will allow us to count all foreign nationals in and out of the uk while checking them against watch lists
5758120 these checks make up just one part of britains triple ring of security alongside fingerprint visas for three quarters of the worlds population and the roll out of id cards for foreign nationals locking people to one identity

5758123 it comes down to risk taking propensity and you see it not only in driving but in other behaviours

5758125 there is anecdotal evidence to say that they are taking more risks
5758126 i think it is changing in a lot of ways and we need more research to understand it
5758127 police have previously received reports and conducted investigations into the receipt of this kind of material
5758128 we encourage parents whose children come across any form of child exploitation images or other inappropriate material to contact their nearest police station
5758129 were seeing an uptick now but we dont consider this to be more than upward pressure from low prices in the past

5758150 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5758151 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5758152 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5758153 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5758154 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5758155 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5758156 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5758157 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5758158 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5758159 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
5758160 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
5758161 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
5758162 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
5758163 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
5758164 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
5758165 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
5758166 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
5758167 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues

5758170 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
5758171 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
5758172 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
5758173 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5758174 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5758175 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5758176 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5758177 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5758178 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5758179 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5758180 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5758181 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5758182 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5758183 the extraordinary new members of our community could have chosen to study at many other engaging places they chose william amp mary this is good
5758184 of the countless factors that go into making a school great the most crucial is the caliber of its people
5758185 we look forward to seeing these new students on campus and we know they will thrive here
5758186 the success of william and mary students in the fulbright u s student program is truly exceptional
5758187 selection for this national honor demonstrates our students talent intelligence dedication and desire to make a real difference in the world and the range of disciplines represented by our fulbright awardees speaks volumes about the faculty support for this program
5758188 i will be working with a reading group and discussing the role of fairy tales and traditional stories on identity formation in this tiny multilingual country
5758189 the study of languages and how they shape our lives and thoughts is my passion and im thrilled to have the opportunity to study and teach in andorra through the fulbright program
5758190 i think a very big part of the adventure for me will be adjusting to life truly on my own for the first time and beyond that in a foreign country
5758191 a lot of people underestimate the cultural differences that exist between western europe and the u s i know i did the first time i went there and for me learning to navigate all these differences and really adapt to a german lifestyle is a lot of the fun so i guess you could say i am seeking a heightened awareness of what it means to live in our globalized world
5758192 the good thing about the critical language program grant is that ill have six months to kind of sit there and observe everything while im going through the language institute before i do any of my research
5758193 so ill be fairly open to new ideas and making contacts to facilitate those ideas
5758194 im thrilled to have the opportunity to spend nine months in mexico as an english teaching assistant which i see as a unique continuation of my college studies as both an english major and a hispanic studies minor
5758195 im looking forward to still being a student to taking part in the cultural and educational exchange of experiences knowledge and ideas that a fulbright enables
5758196 en lo que concierne a un segundo est mulo no creo que estemos all en este momento

5758201 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5758202 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5758203 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5758204 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5758205 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5758206 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5758207 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5758208 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5758209 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5758210 at lord amp taylor staffers invite special customers in on their birthdays for cake and fitting room parties
5758211 he thought we were calling for another reason if you know what i mean
5758212 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5758213 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5758214 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5758215 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5758216 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5758217 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5758218 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5758219 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5758220 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5758221 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5758222 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5758223 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5758224 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5758225 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5758226 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5758227 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5758228 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5758229 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5758230 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5758231 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5758232 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5758233 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5758234 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5758235 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5758236 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5758237 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5758238 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5758239 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5758240 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5758241 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5758242 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5758243 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5758244 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5758245 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

5758247 the candidates want to stoke the speculation with nods hints and winks to get as much visibility as they can for the ultimate announcement

5758296 in the past floods caused problem to transportation and it was hard for children to come to school but in recent years vietnam has built protective dykes and residential areas above the flood peaking level
5758297 since the floods are to wash away alum we expect the yield of the next winter spring rice crop to be good at least on par with this year
5758298 floods are forecast to rise above the average level in many years

5758303 imam bukhari berdalil dengan ayat ini untuk menunjukkan wajibnya mempunyai ilmu sebelum ucapan dan perbuatan ini dalil yang tepat menunjukkan bahwa manusia hendaknya mengetahui terlebih dahulu baru kemudian mengamalkannya ada juga dalil aqli yang menunjukkan hal serupa yaitu bahwasanya amal dan ucapan tidak akan benar dan diterima sehingga sesuai dengan syariat seseorang tidak akan tahu apakah amalnya sesuai dengan syariat atau tidak kecuali dengan ilmu tetapi ada beberapa hal yang manusia bisa mengetahuinya secara fithrah seperti pengetahuan bahwa allah adalah satu satunya sesembahan sebab yang demikian ini sudah menjadi fithrah manusia karena itulah tidak perlu bersusah payah untuk mempelajari bahwa allah itu esa adapun masalah masalah juziyah yang beragam perlu untuk dipelajari dan memerlukan usaha keras

5758315 the bible says that pride is a sin and id be showing more pride than even john mccain thinks i have with those celebrity and moses ads if i told you that i know with certainty when life begins i wish i did because then this would be an easy question but heres where i stand

5758323 weve been put on election alert three or four times now
5758324 we have everything ready to go once the writs dropped
5758325 i did think it would play out until 09 but harpers sounding as if he wants to go to the polls
5758326 we have everything in place that we need to start a campaign so were just looking forward to the time when it actually starts
5758327 the more lead time a party and candidate has the better off they are
5758328 weve got an ongoing candidate search in all the ridings where we dont have candidates so its just basically meeting with people talking to them seeing whos interested
5758329 obviously wed like to have someone in place if theres a fall election wed like to give them as much time as possible
5758330 we have a small but pretty dedicated group there in p a
5758331 they were active in the provincial election so theyre ready to go for a federal election
5758332 its mostly an update and a more detailed document than the one made in 1987
5758333 the purpose of the plan is mostly physical development of the city itself
5758334 were confident that the plan will be updated at least every five years
5758335 if we grow slow the plan will still be in place but it wont be put into action as quickly
5758336 we dont like to put population because its just a guess number
5758337 thats the west hill area and thats the crescent acres area
5758338 were also looking across the river just east of little red river park
5758339 there are two ways to develop that land for the city to annex the land or by reaching a tax sharing agreement with the rural municipality of prince albert

5758344 after going through charley this doesnt seem nothing more than a gust of wind
5758345 there can be no business as usual under present circumstances
5758346 the future of our relations will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to honor the words of president dimitry medvedev to abide by the six point peace plan which is not happening at the moment
5758347 a new line in europe where russia somehow asserts that there are those who cannot opt for a trans atlantic future is unacceptable
5758348 it is time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw russian forces
5758349 we are very disappointed because despite the promise to us there is no withdrawal of troops
5758350 when you sign up to an agreement you have to respect it
5758351 we dont want to use this sort of pressure but we also dont want this document the peace deal to remain a dead letter
5758352 if this conflict continues to widen i dont think the market is going to be able to ignore it anymore
5758353 the economic news that continues to come in is all pretty gloomy out there
5758354 i dont think weve seen the last of iran and israel
5758355 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5758356 is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
5758357 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks
5758358 behind all of these claims and positions by sen obama lies the ambition to be president whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief
5758359 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain
5758360 when i look out at this audience i see people of different political views you are democrats and republicans and independents but you all served together and fought together and bled together under the same proud flag you did not serve a red america or a blue america you served the united states of america
5758361 now its time to succeed in iraq by turning iraq over to its sovereign government
5758362 we should not keep sending our troops to fight tour after tour of duty while our military is overstretched we should not keep spending 10 billion a month in iraq while americans struggle in a sluggish economy
5758363 ending the war will allow us to invest in america to strengthen our military and to finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan and the border region of pakistan
5758364 this crisis underscores the need for engaged u s leadership in the world
5758365 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed american leadership means getting engaged earlier to shape events so that were not merely responding to them

5758368 more than a third of democratic delegates offered no opinion among those who did state a preference senator clinton was the overwhelming favorite
5758369 in other words the number of people who did not care exceeded the number who preferred clinton
5758370 sixty one percent of delegates surveyed said they thought mrs clinton would help mr obamas chances of winning the election if she was added to the ticket while 13 percent said she would hurt his chances and 18 percent said she would not make a difference
5758371 oddly enough this doesnt bode well for clintons prospects she received 44 of the delegates in the primary logically one would think that clintons delegates would want her on the ticket meaning that she should draw at least 44 in this poll

5758517 the extent to which the market was overheated on a local basis in 2007 is quite a lot to do with this and the rate that we think household income will rise

5758519 this property market downturn has affected virtually all property sectors and uk regions simultaneously but regions will vary far more when the upturn comes
5758520 the lack of turnover and new supply which is such a feature of this downturn will be likely to lead to sharp increases in value in high demand low supply areas
5758521 this downturn is severe and will almost certainly last for at least another year but it is has been caused by the withdrawal of credit not the withdrawal of long term demand or by diminished purchasing power amongst owner occupiers

5758562 you could go online and download the names addresses and phone numbers of 100 people in your neighborhood to get out and vote or the 40 people on your block who were undecided

5758564 the key networking advance in the obama field operation was really deploying community building tools in a smart way from the very beginning
5758565 when the campaign ended we thought howard dean was not destined to be president but what we are doing online this is too big to let go away
5758566 we developed all the tools the obama campaign is using sms text messaging phone tools web capacity
5758567 they blue state digital did a lot of nice work in taking this crude set of unrelated applications and making a complete suite
5758568 we made some projections of traffic levels contribution amounts and e mail levels based on estimates from folks who worked with john kerry and dean in 2004
5758569 we were watching the traffic go up and up surpassing all our previous records
5758570 so we had to do a lot of work to make sure we kept up with the demand his online success had placed on the system
5758571 the campaign consciously or unconsciously became much more of a media operation than simply a presidential campaign because they recognized that by putting their message out onto these various platforms their supporters would spread it for them
5758572 we are going from the era of the sound bite to the sound blast
5758573 they have done a great job in being precise in the use of the tools
5758574 in iowa it was house parties looking for a highly committed local network in south carolina it was a massive get out the vote effort
5758575 we provided the tools remote training and opportunity for supporters to build the campaign on their own
5758576 when the campaign eventually did deploy staff to these states they supplemented an already built infrastructure and volunteer network
5758577 millions of phone calls were made to early primary states by people who used the website to reach out and connect with them
5758578 on every metric this campaign has operated on a scale that has exceeded what has been done before we facilitate actions of every sort sending e mails out to millions and millions of people organizing tens of thousands of events
5758579 but the point of the campaign is to get someone to donate money make calls write letters organize a house party the core of the software is having those links to taking action to doing something

5758585 however then i began to understand that only with proper technical methods like those required by big markets such as the eu or us would my fruit gain access to such long term and stable markets said quang
5758586 so i changed my planting methods according to the new technical standards
5758587 now my friends and i are planning to set up a joint farm in doing so we will save a lot of time and money by investing in improving our land and irrigation systems and our fruit can be coded more easily

5758883 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5758884 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5758885 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5758886 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5758887 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5758888 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5758889 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5758890 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5758891 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5758892 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5758893 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5758894 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5758895 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5758896 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5758897 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5758898 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5758899 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5758900 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5758901 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5758902 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5758903 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5758904 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5758905 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5758906 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5758907 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5758908 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5758909 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5758910 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5758911 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5758912 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5758913 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5758914 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5758915 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5758916 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5758917 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5758918 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5758919 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5758920 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5758921 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5758922 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5758923 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5758924 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5758925 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5758926 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5758927 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5758928 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5758929 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5758930 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5758931 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5758932 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5758933 i just want to thank the coaching staff for going out on a limb for me and understanding the circumstances i have been in and obstacles i have had to go through
5758934 i also thank the university and the ncaa for giving me this chance
5758935 i also appreciate the work of our compliance staff and the southeastern conference and the wisdom of the ncaa staff of approving this for a quality young man
5758936 the whole system is about helping student athletes be successful and its good to see they are making that happen
5758937 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5758938 gosh you seem to have had a lot of beer last night
5758939 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5758940 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5758941 isso indica que eles aprendem um com os outros o que n o uma surpresa mas tamb m parece demonstrar que eles exibem elementos do que entre humanos chamar amos de um comportamento cultural
5758942 esse comportamento cultural desenvolvido em grupos e passado entre os indiv duos acabando por definir esses grupos e inclui uma forma de linguagem ou dan a e parece que esses golfinhos podem ter desenvolvido o h bito de andar com a cauda como um comportamento cultural
5758943 a gente tem que fazer de repente uma lei seca para o pedestre
5758944 tem que passar por todo um processo cultural de reaprendizado no sentido de que ele realmente se oriente para atravessar as ruas

5758954 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5758955 this is a planning took where all things are going
5758956 datallegro is a tremendously innovative company that has started to redefine the data warehouse market
5758957 microsoft sql server 2008 delivers enterprise class capabilities in business intelligence and data warehousing and the addition of the datallegro team and its technology will take our data platform to the highest scale of data warehousing
5758958 integrating datallegros nonproprietary hardware platform and flexible software architecture into microsoft sql server will provide customers with the strongest offering in the market
5758959 we are excited to join forces with microsoft and continue the innovation this company was founded on
5758960 as data warehouses are becoming more strategic to organizations and as data warehouse appliances mature the adoption rate of the data warehouse appliance is increasing rapidly
5758961 data warehouse appliances are more than just plug and play
5758962 the mystery behind paris hiltons big boobs has been solved and no it doesnt involve plastic surgery
5758963 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5758964 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5758965 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5758966 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5758967 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5758968 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5758969 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5758970 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5758971 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5758972 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5758973 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5758974 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5758975 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5758976 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5758977 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5758978 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5758979 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5758980 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5758981 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5758982 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5758983 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5758984 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5758985 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5758986 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5758987 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5758988 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5758989 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5758990 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5758991 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5758992 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5758993 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5758994 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5758995 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5758996 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5758997 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5758998 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5758999 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5759000 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5759001 je suis tellement bien cest fini et jai une m daille au cou

5759005 there is no deal with the president and he had himself resigned
5759006 the coalition will now have to apply themselves because they will have no excuse
5759007 i just love that part just watching the scores pop up and see if theyre higher or lower thats one of my favourite things
5759008 a 41 would have made me really happy but 40 7 i cant complain obviously
5759009 i knew it was beatable by the chinese since he had beat it and some of the other competitors had tied it in the prelims i knew i wasnt quite safe but i was still happy overall
5759010 he set the bar so high we know it would be really difficult to beat were just so proud of him
5759011 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5759012 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5759013 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5759014 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5759015 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5759016 ah he doesnt even drive that fast anymore scoffed the head coach of canadas trampoline team
5759017 his insurance rates went up he got a lot of tickets
5759018 but its not like my 11 year old car can get much over 100
5759019 one of my favourite parts of competition actually confessed burnett
5759020 the tension the anxiety of waiting for the scores to pop up
5759021 were over the moon this is awesome said ross of the second trampoline medal in two nights for his sky riders club in toronto coming on the heels of karen cockburns silver on monday in the womens event
5759022 heading into this event we figured 15 of the 15 guys could possibly make finals jason was a little lucky to make the top eight but today we decided to go big and see how it goes he went big he was great the second element in his routine was the hardest of any athlete here today
5759023 a 41 wouldve made me really happy said burnett who owns the federation internationale de gymnastique competition record for dd at 17
5759024 the 40 7 was great but i knew it could be caught by the chinese
5759025 i remember him as a little kid in the gym watching matt turgeon 2000 olympic bronze medallist and jason saying thats cool
5759026 and matt remember used to hold the unofficial dd before jason took it from him
5759027 well the first time i sucked but i tried gymnastics and i was just better on the trampoline i guess it was the right choice
5759028 i think what was the most amazing thing marvelled cockburn joining in an impromptu celebration of family friends and teammates in the press mixed zone as burnett entered wearing his medal
5759029 for someone in his position he handled the pressure so so well
5759030 he didnt do much but its nice to have him back
5759031 its just going to be about knocking the rust off and get going i dont think it will take that long at all like riding a bike
5759032 you know how it is when you have to play you have to play
5759033 i told the trainers you are going to have to get me anti anxiety medication
5759034 i spent all offseason rehabbing both shoulders and the thumb and then my back gets hurt good night
5759035 just starting these two preseason games was huge for me i thought i did well
5759036 an exclusive experience for those with discerning taste who seek the very best that life has to offer
5759037 youll see jesus before you see no 4 on the four train
5759038 i just dont think anybody should pigeonhole themselves and we dont
5759039 i just go with the music when theres a heavier point in the song or lyrics that i think needs to be screamed thats when i do it
5759040 i was in another band at the time and we played a show together
5759041 i dropped everything drove out to tried out for the band and the rest is history pretty much
5759042 were struggling to go out on the road gas is ridiculous a lot of what we make on tour goes to gas
5759043 were not the only ones dealing with it everyone is touring bands people who have to drive to 9 to 5s everyday
5759044 well probably be touring non stop for the rest of our lives
5759045 i think its good to be able to jump from one to the other end of the spectrum i just dont think its smart to just lock yourself in and sound like everyone else its not like we are a regular band with a guy singer in a genre full of millions of guy singers
5759046 but i think its our music that really sets us apart
5759047 cold when i am denied it your light is ultraviolet
5759048 sometimes we love people so much that we have to be numb to it because if we actually felt how much we love them it would kill us
5759049 i am personally disappointed in your support for the church of ugandas crusade against homosexuality that is because i am a homosexual myself a gay ugandan it hurts us a lot to find that you our leader rejects us so soundly saying that we are foreign puzzles us we are ugandans through and through why do you call us foreigners just because we are homosexual
5759050 sometimes we love people so much that we have to be numb to it because if we actually felt how much we love them it would kill us
5759051 before any further discussion a certain caution is in order
5759052 korea is a good team because they won all their previous games and they pitched well today
5759053 but we tried different pitchers because the final stage is more important than today
5759054 i think our government has been reluctant to act i think we should recognize that this is the capital that the israelis have chosen if thats their choice then it should be our respect of their government seat to have our embassy here
5759055 we would hardly tolerate it if the israelis said we dont recognize washington d

5759057 you cannot have a divided jerusalem and hope that it will one day have the kind of peace that i think everybody would want for it
5759058 i dont think you can have walls and barbed wire and call that an undivided city thats not undivided thats very divided and its unrealistic to suggest that there can be that kind of situation

5759061 from what ive seen and read about it i think itll be a great track to race on so i cant wait for the weekend to start
5759062 the atmosphere will no doubt be fantastic as well because the spanish have a real passion for formula 1
5759063 the new track looks great and should be really interesting to race on
5759064 as at monaco and montreal our car goes well at these kinds of tracks so im hoping well put in a good performance there
5759065 it shouldnt take too long for the drivers to get used to the circuit and for the first time the rest of the grid will be learning it with me

5759104 our existing performance review systems were very generic and didnt focus enough on the individual
5759105 we realised they were not progressive enough and we wanted an effective way to show our employees that we were investing in their career development while implementing a high performance culture as part of our overall people strategy to attract train and retain staff we needed the ability to collaborate across the group we also wanted to be more proactive and strategic about managing our training in particular we wanted the ability to identify skills gaps and high performers within the business
5759106 we did a benchmark of suppliers and were very quickly impressed with the level of service insight and expertise from successfactors
5759107 we were particularly impressed with successfactors leadership status and industry expertise in the hotel sector and their track record at helping organisations implement a high performance culture because successfactors is delivered online we can create a dynamic system that directly links to our development and training systems that highlights training skills requirements rather than just a once a year paper based process we will also be able to collaborate across the group enabling senior management to share ideas work together more closely and transparently cascade our group objectives down through the business to provide an overall snapshot of the organisation
5759108 we are delighted to be partnering with successfactors this latest investment forms just one part of our overall global people strategy which includes competency based recruitment and succession planning successfactors provides us with a means by which we can administer and manage our plans in a timely and consistent manner across different hotels and geographies
5759109 we have more than 30 brand name hotel customers around the world and understand that the hotel industry in particular faces a unique set of challenges a transient workforce from multi national backgrounds high churn and a very competitive marketplace particularly in the higher end of the market the lancaster landmark hotel group is a great example of an organisation that understands the role and rewards that effective development collaboration and communication can play in staying both competitive and differentiated by identifying and developing their internal talent lancaster landmark will be able to provide a clear career progression path and precisely identify any skills gaps at the individual employee level while providing senior management with the visibility collaboration and insight at a group level to track and manage company wide performance objectives
5759110 last year everything was so hectic not knowing what to expect and being anxious and everything
5759111 i kind of went back and forth from position to position and i never could get comfortable being my second year i know how things work and i have a better idea of what my role on the team will be
5759112 i have family here so that played probably a bigger role in me coming to iowa than the fact my mom graduated from here
5759113 i like the whole atmosphere in general i love iowa city and of course the campus is great and the school is really appealing its known world wide for its academics and that was a big factor in me coming here
5759114 this is one of the best conferences in the nation and the competition is great
5759115 every team is tough and you have to get out there and play hard and youre going to be up against the best players
5759116 we had already gone through most of our spring season
5759117 we were just anxious to get someone in there once coach dingman got here it was a nice change to have things organized and have that leadership back again were all really excited
5759118 they also seem confident that they know what theyre doing and they know what it will take for us to get back on track
5759119 she is soaking everything up that weve been teaching and shes excited about having that type of responsibility
5759120 just having the team chemistry and knowing that we all went through it last year and having that bond of the different hardships we encountered together last year we all want to get more wins out there and have fun playing together i want to get back to having fun and being able to go out there comfortably and play hard
5759121 of course there are a lot of differences between high school and college but i dont think i was taken too much by surprise because i played club for so many years at such a high level
5759122 the competition level was definitely different it was also different as far as balancing my school and volleyball the practices are longer and then you have college school work now i know how to balance my time a little better
5759123 i came back early because i wanted to focus on working out relaxing and enjoying the rest of the summer before we start up again

5759133 they like our movies the way we make our movies they dont want us to go too artsy fartsy theyd be like its not the same company so we give them what they want for instance the jackson hole pow segment is going to have a reggae soundtrack its one of our staples so we hold true to it
5759134 you gotta keep the audience in mind but not pander to it
5759135 give em what they want but in a new different way
5759136 we shot the red camera next to the 16 millimeter cameras and the red kind of wins out an awful lot its like youre watching an imax movie or something
5759137 the 16 millimeter film footage tells the story so the helmet cam footage is really just the icing on the cake
5759138 a lot of factors can go wrong like snow on the lens and so forth but when it does work theres no substitute for it sometimes it can hold a segment all by itself throw it on somebody like ian macintosh straight lining a 50 foot wide couloir it looks like star wars type shit

5759218 la problem tica de estas viviendas se arrastra desde hace m s de 20 a os debido a la mala gesti n y dejadez de las pol ticas urban sticas que ha aplicado el partido popular que nunca se ha atrevido a cumplir el marco jur dico vigente para atajar este fen meno que afecta al municipio
5759219 a aclarar definitivamente si estas edificaciones se legalizar n se derribar n como han iniciado algunos ayuntamientos como el de montserrat o si dejar transcurrir la legislatura sin tomar una decisi n al respecto
5759220 esta situaci n de dejadez provoca que muchos de los n cleos residenciales carezcan de servicios b sicos como el asfaltado alumbrado o canalizaci n de las aguas residuales

5759223 aplicar estrictamente la ley en materia urban stica que impide legalizar estas construcciones ilegales ya que en caso contrario podr a producirse una situaci n de discriminaci n entre aquellos propietarios que han conseguido su pertinente permiso de obra para edificar su vivienda y aquellos que sin llegar a solicitar autorizaci n alguna reciben una c dula de habitabilidad por parte del ayuntamiento

5759301 she is our daughter and we love her and cant cut her out of our lives but we strongly disagree with how she is conducting herself and she knows how disappointed we are
5759302 the message she is promoting is about homosexuality which the bible clearly states is a sin

5759325 the thing that pops into everyones mind when you say russia is that the last time we played them they denied the u s a chance to play for a gold medal in the 2006 world championships
5759326 however when youre that close whoever they put in front of you youre excited to play against
5759327 russia is a talented team they are going to come ready to play
5759328 we really wanted to make a conscious effort to go inside
5759329 i should have called for it earlier there is always next game
5759330 weve got confidence against that team russia i think we match up well with russia
5759331 we never went out during the time we were training
5759332 our school is quite strict when we stay in school we cant go out on our own let alone when were at a military camp
5759333 north korea is no 1 in the world when it comes to uniformity they are uniform beyond belief these kind of traditional synchronized movements result in a sense of beauty we chinese are able to achieve this as well though hard training and strict discipline
5759334 in one week we could only work four and a half days we had to have coffee breaks twice a day couldnt go into overtime and just a little discomfort was not allowed because of human rights
5759335 you could not criticize them either they all belong to some organizations they have all kind of institutions unions we do not have that we can work very hard can withstand lots of bitterness we can achieve in one week what they can achieve in one month
5759336 at one point the children had to run in four different directions when one fell others quickly followed
5759337 we had only two meals for the entire time there was almost no time to sleep even less time for toilet breaks
5759338 but we didnt feel so angry because the director was also there with us the whole time
5759339 he really felt like to have an opportunity to medal hed have to have a bump in his start value
5759340 i hit the floor and i looked at mark and said can you believe that just happened
5759341 you cant be upset with two medals at my first olympics
5759342 four years ago we had a large failure and we blamed ourselves
5759343 but today we are all proud of ourselves todays success is due to the hard work confidence and excellent skills of our gymnasts the big competitions test the success rate and our mental status and we all performed
5759344 i had a more advantageous position on the start list so i watched the gymnasts perform before me
5759345 because they didnt do very well i didnt use my most difficult routine
5759346 i thought i had a chance to win the gold medal and finished my routine beautifully
5759347 making good use of bonus points for connections between moves was our advantage
5759348 his performance was excellent the reason we won is because we understand more thoroughly the rules
5759349 i was really happy with aguero today he scored two goals and he played fantastic
5759350 this team has committed themselves to each match at the olympics to try and win the
5759351 this is what they will continue to do against nigeria in the final nigeria is a really strong team we want to savour this win over brazil first
5759352 of course this will put more pressure and there will be some doubts about me as the coach and the team but i have faith in my work and in my players
5759353 we will evaluate this defeat and look into the problem areas and we will study everything this is what happens in football sometimes you win sometimes you lose but the most important thing is we have to put our heart into it
5759354 you hit a hurdle about twice a year where it affects your race
5759355 its just a shame that it was on the biggest race of my life
5759356 the hurdles were just coming up very fast and i just told myself what i always tell myself keep things tight
5759357 but its kind of like when you are racing a car and going max velocity and you hit a curve either you can maintain control or you can crash and burn today i crashed and burned
5759358 you have certain people that are supposed to be the favourites
5759359 on this particular day and at this time you have to run your best race
5759360 its anyones race we do hurdles and they come at you really fast you have to execute your race
5759361 she sent me an email telling me you can do it stay focused its about you when you race on that day and that time focus on you
5759362 i felt something happened i didnt know how serious it was but you have to focus on you because if i got caught up in her then who knows whatll happen to me
5759363 mary kate is the most beutiful girl on the world she is now perfect i wont to be her oh god she s so hoot perfe
5759364 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5759365 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5759366 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5759367 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5759368 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5759369 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5759370 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5759371 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5759372 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5759373 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5759374 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5759375 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5759376 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5759377 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5759378 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5759379 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5759380 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5759381 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5759382 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5759383 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5759384 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5759385 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5759386 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5759387 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5759388 the thing that pops into everyones mind when you say russia is that the last time we played them they denied the u s a chance to play for a gold medal in the 2006 world championships
5759389 however when youre that close whoever they put in front of you youre excited to play against
5759390 russia is a talented team they are going to come ready to play
5759391 we really wanted to make a conscious effort to go inside
5759392 i should have called for it earlier there is always next game
5759393 weve got confidence against that team russia i think we match up well with russia
5759394 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5759395 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5759396 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5759397 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5759398 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5759399 mary kate is the most beutiful girl on the world she is now perfect i wont to be her oh god she s so hoot perfe
5759400 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5759401 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5759402 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5759403 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5759404 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5759405 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5759406 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5759407 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5759408 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5759409 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5759410 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5759411 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5759412 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5759413 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5759414 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5759415 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5759416 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5759417 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5759418 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5759419 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5759420 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5759421 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5759422 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5759423 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5759424 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5759425 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5759426 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

5759435 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5759436 mary kate is the most beutiful girl on the world she is now perfect i wont to be her oh god she s so hoot perfe
5759437 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5759438 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5759439 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5759440 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5759441 had he and i but met by some old ancient inn but ranged as infantry we should have sat us down to wet and staring face to face right many a nipperkin i shot at him as he at me and killed him in his place i shot him dead because because he was my foe he thought hed list perhaps just so my foe of course he was off hand like just as i thats clear enough although was out of work had sold his traps no other reason why yes quaint and curious war is you shoot a fellow down youd treat if met where any bar is or help to half a crown
5759442 the strength of the constitution lies entirely in the determination of each citizen to defend it only if every single citizen feels duty bound to do his share in this defense are the constitutional rights secure
5759443 todays supreme court decision is yet another stinging rebuke of the bush administrations extreme views on executive power time after time the supreme court has rebuffed the administrations attempts to undermine the constitution from its rasul and hamdi decisions in 2004 to its hamdan decision in 2006 it is a testament to our system of government that the court has rejected the habeas stripping provisions of the military commissions act and reaffirmed that the government does not have the power to detain people indefinitely and arbitrarily without judicial review the writ of habeas corpus provides one of the most significant protections of human freedom against arbitrary government action ever created we can and must fight terrorists without abandoning the principles on which our country was founded
5759444 the constitution only gives people the right to pursue happiness you have to catch it yourself
5759445 the constitution is not an instrument for the government to restrain the people it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government lest it come to dominate our lives and interests
5759446 no provision in our constitution ought to be dearer to man than that which protects the rights of conscience against the enterprises of the civil authority
5759447 we the people are the rightful masters of both congress and the courts not to overthrow the constitution but to overthrow the men who pervert the constitution
5759448 dont interfere with anything in the constitution that must be maintained for it is the only safeguard of our liberties
5759449 i prefer a man who will burn the flag and then wrap himself in the constitution to a man who will burn the constitution and then wrap himself in the flag
5759450 were always just a phone call away from a disaster
5759451 i have not seen the heimlich maneuver now in over 20 years i couldnt see well or tell if he was injured by the fall
5759452 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5759453 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5759454 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5759455 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5759456 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5759457 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5759458 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5759459 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5759460 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5759461 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5759462 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5759463 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5759464 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5759465 who are open to doing something on the production side
5759466 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5759467 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5759468 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5759469 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

5759693 its the same sentence as in 2000 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california yet the issue that will be put before voters nov 4 is radically different this time the wording would be used to rescind an existing constitutional right to marry we fervently hope that voters whatever their personal or religious convictions will shudder at such a step and vote no on proposition 8
5759694 the state of same sex marriage shifted in may when the california supreme court overturned proposition 22 the ban on gay marriage that voters approved eight years ago and ruled that marriage was a fundamental right under the state constitution
5759695 what voters must consider about proposition 8 is that unlike proposition 22 this is no longer about refining existing california law in the wake of the courts ruling the only way to deny marriage to gay and lesbian couples is by revising constitutional rights themselves proposition 8 seeks to embed wording in the constitution that would eliminate the fundamental right to same sex marriage
5759696 our increasing tendency to speak of what is most important to us in terms of rights and to frame nearly every social controversy as a clash of rights
5759697 the most distinctive features of our american rights dialect are the very ones that are most conspicuously in tension with what we require in order to give a reasonably full and coherent account of what kind of society we are and what kind of polity we are trying to create its penchant for absolute extravagant formulations its near aphasia concerning responsibility its excessive homage to individual independence and self sufficiency its habitual concentration on the individual and the state at the expense of the intermediate groups of civil society and its unapologetic insularity not only does each of these traits make it difficult to give voice to common sense or moral intuitions they also impede development of the sort of rational political discourse that is appropriate to the needs of a mature complex liberal pluralistic development

5759863 we therefore call on the people of sinoe to ignore the false and misleading article and its intention to derail our efforts for peace and unity
5759864 the sinoe ad hoc mediation committee has read with indignation and shock a news story carried in the august 18 2008 edition of the analyst newspaper that is entitled
5759865 in fact the version of the report as narrated in the news story is entirely different from the committees report
5759866 the committee categorically denies the story in the analyst news paper
5759867 the report was an honest sincere and balanced attempt to ratify the ills presently exiting in the county and advance proposals for resolution and progress
5759868 we urge him not to waiver in his commitment to sinoe and the finding of common ground or compromise in the sinoes interest
5759869 therefore it is incumbent upon all sinoeans to ensure that their officials collaborate coordinate and consult the hope of the sinoe people has been heightened and they are anxiously awaiting development in their county
5759870 finally we call upon these detractors of peace unity and reconciliation to stop this old age lopsided politicking at the expense of sinoe county and its citizens
5759871 even though we were initially unsuspecting our story sampled citizens views that actually questioned the credibility of the charges said to have been leveled against senator nyenpan this indicates that by publishing the story we intended no harm for sinoe or senator nyenpan we published the story even though we were unable to contact chairman tweh because we thought what was alleged was a common problem in liberias local government administrations that needed to be highlighted
5759872 mr jah is suspected of using the materials for the construction of his private residence in greenville during the meeting sinoe county representative timothy davies publicly announced that mr jah misapplied the development funds and has thus far gone with impunity with the protection of senator nyenpan
5759873 out of usd 366 666 the sinoe senior senator allocated usd 209 500 to the sarpos while leaving the other tribes to receive about usd 29 000 each
5759874 this was vehemently opposed by the county superintendent to the dislike of senator nyenpan
5759875 henceforth in order to equitably spread development throughout the county development funds will be proportionally divided amongst the five statutory districts with the commonwealth of greenville receiving 25 of the overall development allocations
5759876 by this recommendation no one tribe will benefit at the expense of another regarding development the committee also recommended that as of now all members of the sinoe legislative caucus receiving complaints from any segment of the county be it from individuals or groups must refer such complaints to the county superintendent for his observation
5759877 all other members of the sinoe legislative caucus have of course approved the confirmation of the statutory district superintendents
5759878 so i as a political leader of the county is not prepared to discuss any matter to the press concerning to the committees work if the report is out and adopted by the citizens then i will be prepared to talk to the press
5759879 why did the police director condoned the usurpation of her power by the transfer of a county police commander by a senator and still what extra constitutional authority does senator nyenpan have to contradict the opinion of the sinoe legislative caucus regarding the dismissal of the assistant superintendent for development joseph jah
5759880 but all being said who is responsible to punish a local government official that acted inappropriately or engaged in outright corruption is it the county legislative caucus or the president through the superintendent it is the president so why did the citizens committee charged nyenpan with ignoring the opinion of his colleagues when the colleagues should not have made the decision to dismiss jah in the first place was nyepan upholding the constitutional separation of powers or shielding his former campaign manager from dismissal that the committee should have established
5759881 if the superintendent wants a local official dismissed for corruption it does not need the approval of the countrys legislative caucus it needs only the advice of the president of liberia so why did the superintendent bowed to nyepans bullying as the probe committee said it has found out
5759882 has the committee completed its mandate has it mediated between the senator and the superintendent
