7910010 id like to give you a piece of my mind
7910011 before you hire a company to build a house you would i expect insist on detailed plans showing what the finished structure was going to look like building a childs mind and character is what public schools do their justification for prematurely breaking family and neighborhood learning where is documentary evidence to prove this assumption that trained and certified professionals do it better than people who know and love them can there isnt any the cost in new york state for building a well schooled child in the year 2000 is 200 000 per body when lost interest is calculated that capital sum invested in the childs name over the past twelve years would have delivered a million dollars to each kid as a nest egg to compensate for having no school the original 200 000 is more than the average home in new york costs you wouldnt build a home without some idea what it would look like when finished but you are compelled to let a corps of perfect strangers tinker with your childs mind and personality without the foggiest idea what they want to do with it

7910018 in analyzing our findings we were somewhat surprised to learn that partners are largely unprepared to handle ownership changes resulting from death disability or termination for example fewer than 30 percent of partners are prepared to deal with the death of a managing partner what was far more astounding however was the number of partners nearly half that did not know how to assess their level of readiness
7910019 this is likely in part because these are difficult issues to deal with from an emotional standpoint however given the profound negative consequences that any uncertainty can have on an enterprise its apparent that the industry has underestimated the importance of thorough contingency planning
7910020 most of the uncertainty surrounding ownership changes results from the lack of a sufficient succession plan of those polled less than one quarter indicated that they have a formal succession plan in place among these firms almost 90 percent believe that they have adequately communicated the elements of their plan to key employees
7910021 however our research suggests that these firms are overrating their level of preparedness as nearly 60 percent have not reviewed the plan in three years or more due to changes to the management structure documents can become quickly outdated and should be reviewed on an annual basis to avoid disruptions to the firm in the event of unanticipated ownership changes
7910022 this increase in authorized shares on top of our recent strong share repurchase activity is as clear an indication as our board and management can give of our belief that our stock is significantly undervalued
7910023 we continue to believe that the purchase of our stock at these prices will deliver outstanding value to our stockholders and is one of the most appropriate uses of our resources at this time moreover we believe that we can do this without sacrificing expansion capital investment or growth plans

7910026 not one of the criteria for the u s news amp world report rankings assesses actual knowledge being gained or what students are being taught
7910027 while the top schools in the u s news ranking do well in terms of financial faculty and alumni resources it is quite clear that in terms of actual academic performance they are simply not placing enough emphasis on the teaching of americas history and founding and subsequently not preparing students to be active citizens this is something both students and their parents should take into account when choosing a college

7910049 in todays media environment it is vital that businesses communicate online and companies that choose to ignore this are running a major risk traditional pr tactics are not going to go away anytime soon but it is essential for companies to integrate online pr and social media into their existing offline communications strategies
7910050 despite finding that an increasing number of uk pr professionals are on the ball when it comes to online pr this survey confirms our experience that a high proportion are still more focused on traditional media however given that this is most probably a reflection of client budget and resource allocations perhaps what we should be asking ourselves is what this says about uk business attitude towards online communications

7910067 together with fishermen we are building a culture for sustainable fishing practices that will guarantee fish stocks in the long term

7910070 by working co operatively collecting data and learning how to improve practices this programme is living proof that conservation and industry can work together for sustainability

7910113 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year
7910114 overall readings are still quite low by historical standards and it is still too early to tell if the worst is behind us
7910115 if you look at the two of us i think i probably have a more rural outlook on life having been brought up in the country and george is more metropolitan but the differences are differences of emphasis we have a genuinely shared view of what was wrong with the conservative party and what is wrong with the country and what wed like to put right
7910116 i knew him at school so i remember this dishevelled large beefy rugby player the fact that he speaks freely and openly is a great thing because weve all got too controlled by fear of saying something politically incorrect or whatever and boris has no fear about that
7910117 the conservative partys brilliance over centuries has been to change to reflect society disraeli understood the conservatism of the suburbs peel understand that there was a growing urban population and we had to repeal the corn laws salisbury understood the importance of patriotism churchill understood the importance of home ownership mrs thatcher understood the importance of giving trade unions back to their members its always been about change
7910118 if you grew up under thatcher you either thought she was doing the wrong thing or she was doing the right thing and i thought she was doing the right thing just as thatcher said own your council house so we should be saying have more choice over the school your kids go to or the hospital you get treated at or own shares in the firm you work for im going to be as radical a social reformer as mrs thatcher was an economic reformer and radical social reform is what this country needs right now
7910119 i voted for him in the membership ballot although samantha favoured clarke no one really knew much about him really and as you say it wasnt a very happy period we werent making any headway however iain was making very strong points about social breakdown which is something hes been working on every since and is doing work on that now for us its right at the heart of our plans
7910120 tony blair was a great campaigner he was a great party leader but he didnt really know what he wanted to change in health in education in crime in policing when he first came in by the end he was beginning to get an idea but when he first came in i dont think he had a clue what matters is that the things you do in the short term dont undermine what you have planned for the long term and i think that was blairs great failing
7910121 he has thought about some of the most important issues of our time and has a very intelligent and conviction driven view of them i think if you look at what hes done in terms of aids in africa it is truly remarkable i remember going to an aids clinic where every last drug had been paid for by the us because of bushs initiative bush has been a disaster on the environment

7910132 job seekers in some fields are competing aggressively for open positions giving employers the edge in those segments of the hiring market at the same time however companies continue to face a shortage of highly skilled professionals in fields such as technology and accounting these in demand workers may not be willing to leave secure positions unless firms extend very attractive job offers
7910133 businesses are operating on leaner resources and are competing to secure the intellectual capital that will drive productivity and new revenue streams companies are also replacing lower performing employees to strengthen their talent bench to prepare for a time when the economy shifts into higher gear
7910134 recruiting highly skilled professionals may require a greater financial commitment or special perks that provide a more attractive work environment however nearly three quarters of employees surveyed said the availability of flexible schedules may cause them to choose one job over another

7910147 the eastern portion of the fault has moved at a predictable rate and the earthquake activity associated with it has been what we would expect
7910148 but the western part of the fault has been lagging in terms of the number and size of earthquakes it seems to be straining absorbing the motion
7910149 it could mean that the fault is getting ready for a large earthquake or it could mean that the movement has been so gradual that we couldnt detect it
7910150 land stations also detected a four fold increase in the number of earthquakes along the blanco fault in 2008 compared to background rates
7910151 our monitoring may be missing a lot of earthquakes that are less than 3 0
7910152 the western side of the fault may be experiencing a series of mini quakes that we cant detect or it could be slowing creeping along in a way we cannot measure
7910153 but we cant discount the possibility that its energy hasnt been released and it will some day in the form of a good sized earthquake

7910173 beloved do not believe every spirit but test the spirits to whether they are from god because many false prophets have gone out into the world by this we know the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ has come in the flesh is from god and every spirit that does not confess jesus is not from god this is the spirit of the antichrist of which you have heard that it is coming and now is already in the world you are from god little children and have overcome them because greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world they are from the world therefore they speak as from the world and the world listens to them we are from god he who knows god listens to us he who is not from god does not listen to us by this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error
7910174 that if you confess with your mouth jesus as lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved for with the heart a person believes resulting in righteousness and with the mouth he confesses resulting in salvation

7910178 i put on gigs here in sheffield england and have had several canadian acts play over the last 18 months weve had some great nights and i know a large part of these shows having happened is the support the artists have had from your government enabling them to tour many have played to new listeners and helped broaden their fanbase making connections that simply wouldnt have happened without the support they received
7910179 to sabotage investments in culture that generate money for the economy not to mention what it generates for the soul is not only scary in what it says for the future of culture in this country but it is also simply gross economic mismanagement
7910180 these programmes are defensible on two important grounds one they pay for themselves in promoting canadian music and arts abroad canadian music alone has returned millions to the treasury thanks to the success our artists have achieved around the world secondly they give the world a picture of this country as something more than hewers of wood and exporters of oil and harvesters of wheat
7910181 the often relatively small amounts granted under the promart and trade routes programs have had a leverage effect for many artists and organizations as they sought support to develop markets abroad contribute to our national image and lend valued support to other general trade development efforts of our missions abroad at the time of writing there is no clear indication that the government intends to replace these programs with more performing ones
7910182 government money is pump priming money success breeds success the irony is if you double the grant to an arts body you probably end up doubling the amount of private giving to it as well because people say i want to invest in something that has the backing of government from my point of view the arts dont win or lose you an election but i think the arts are a powerful voice

7910188 maybe we should have had a discussion before policy is sic put out there publicly mr adams said
7910189 a lot of points and concern about the policy during the meeting
7910190 the basis is right its how you get there and there are some people who have great difficultly in organising a 12 year old to get to school when they dont want to go to school he said
7910191 a lot of us are uncomfortable about this policy but it was a rudd labor commitment and kevin rudd confirmed that yesterday that its a promise he will be keeping she told abc radio today
7910192 i think its fair to say there is a great deal of concern within the caucus
7910193 its a pretty extreme organisation thats got extreme powers that doesnt confront anybody else in australian society he said
7910194 i dont think we need to keep this at the extreme end of where it is at the moment i think we should be able to wind that back somewhat before 2010

7910264 although we may sometimes be ashamed to admit it the slave trade is an integral part of british history
7910265 it is inextricably linked to trade colonisation industrialisation and the british empire
7910266 it is important that children learn about this and the links to wider world history such as the american civil rights movement the repercussions of which are still being felt today
7910267 that is why the slave trade will join the british empire two world wars and the holocaust as compulsory parts of the secondary school history curriculum from this september
7910268 theres a lot of mis education about slavery and it hasnt really been taught in schools at all
7910269 its quite interesting in terms of todays history and what students need to know about the past to understand the present
7910270 you cant really talk about the history of the british empire without discussing this part of history
7910271 officers have not yet been able to get into the house due to the severity of the fire

7910277 oh dear why isnt the conservative media machine keeping these idiots locked up in a dark room somewhere where they cant annoy us
7910278 the fact that britain has the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in europe
7910279 the much heralded dutch teen pregnancy abortion and birthrates used are for all females under 20 years of age including elementary school children while ours are for adolescents ages 15 to 19 if you factor in prepubescent girls naturally you come up with a much smaller number also teenage girls are routinely put on the pill in holland there is a strong emphasis on delaying sexual activity fetal development is taught in schools and most dutch educators report they do not use condom demonstrations there is little tolerance for teenage pregnancy unwed mothers are not subsidized the way they are in the u s
7910280 getting pregnant seems to be for some people the way to get a council house
7910281 instead its put together by a load of middle class liberals who want to be down with the kids its all done in a hey kids this is how you should be doing it no wonder kids leave tinking they should be having sex
7910282 the simple fact is that the democracies with the lowest rates of teen pregnancies sexually transmitted diseases and the highest ages of first sexual contact are those with the best and most comprehensive sex education at the earliest age
7910283 all sex education teaches abstinence as the most effective way to avoid pregnancy and stds its abstinence only education thats the problem
7910284 more nonsense from faux conservatives like bercow wish he would cross the floor and be done with it
7910285 all sex education teaches abstinence as the most effective way to avoid pregnancy and stds
7910286 in my view the way we teach sex ed is part of the problem many teenagers must come away from the pshe lessons believing that they are out of line by not having sex
7910287 the power belongs to you im threw with pushing forward with bound hands crawling on my knees living off hope grasping onto a promised slither of faith im no magician my determination was no illusion and i prayed i had some strength belief i had an ounce of true power only to realize it was just a delusion the power is yours and always has been my faith has broken my hope is gone and the slither of faith has snapped so the power is yours completely as it has truly been but what will you do now that you no longer have me to interfere no longer to lend a guiding hand and no longer helping guide you down the correct path what will you do with your power and how will you wield it how will you keep it together
7910288 or will you just allow your apathy to let it fade away

7910290 he who loses wealth loses much he who loses a friend loses more but he that loses his courage loses all
7910291 you therefore have no excuse you who pass judgment on someone else for at whatever point you judge the other you are condemning yourself because you who pass judgment do the same things
7910292 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7910293 who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and our sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7910294 i have never had someone inspire me the way people tell me my father inspired them but i do now barack obama
7910295 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world
7910296 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation
7910297 even though he had this funny name even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
7910298 he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did and like my family they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7910299 where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7910300 how this time in this great country where a girl from the south side of chicago can go to college and law school and the son of a single mother from hawaii can go all the way to the white house we committed ourselves to building the world as it should be
7910301 the party that once emphasized individual rights has gravitated in recent years toward regulating values
7910302 the party of military responsibility has taken us to war with a country that did not attack us the party that formerly led the world in arms control has moved to undercut treaties crucial to the defense of the earth the party that prides itself on conservation has abdicated its responsibilities in the face of global warming and the party historically anchored in fiscal restraint has nearly doubled the national debt squandering our precious resources in an undisciplined and unprecedented effort to finance a war with tax cuts
7910303 there are going to be some of senator clintons supporters who were going to have to work hard to persuade to come on board thats not surprising
7910304 if you take a look this week i am absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and bill clinton understand the stakes
7910305 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7910306 we are united and we are together and we are determined
7910307 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7910308 feels like the obama campaign ran against and systematically dismissed his administrations accomplishments and he feels like he was painted as a racist during the primary process

7910318 i am told bhupendra singh chopra was a bajrang dal member even earlier bajrang dal activists were found to be indulging in antisocial activities in kanpur
7910319 i dont deny they were active in the bajrang dal a few years ago but they were inactive these days
7910320 such things can be bought from the market any day during dussehra and diwali though both bhupendra and rajeev used to meet me i didnt know what they were planning to do
7910321 it was meant for a larger conspiracy most probably these people had planned serial blasts we are investigating their links
7910322 both the men had left their parents homes their relatives knew they were involved in serious criminal activities since 2001
7910323 i have no connection with the organisation bajrang dal since 1996 they do not report to me and i do not chalk out their programmes
7910324 the police can say anything but they were not our members
7910325 we hoped with the cbi probing the case we could get justice but the accused are out on bail

7910367 het heeft geen zin om eindeloos te klagen dat er in de grote media geen plaats meer is voor recensies
7910368 we willen een constructief debat waarin een aantal oplossingen worden besproken voor de problemen van de moderne kunstkritiek
7910369 in kranten is vaak geen plaats meer voor uitgebreide recensies maar kleinere gespecialiseerde bladen zoals recto verso en etcetera bieden wel ruimte voor kunstkritiek het nadeel is dat je met die media geen groot publiek kan bereiken
7910370 ik denk dat het internet heel interessant kan zijn voor kunstkritiek het is een gratis medium waarmee je veel mensen kunt bereiken daarnaast zouden critici moeten durven loskomen van de klassieke recensievorm en eens iets anders proberen een dialoog met een maker na een voorstelling bijvoorbeeld zou een interessante nieuwe manier van werken zijn
7910371 the team were called to the earthquake back in 2005 in pakistan and at the time i was unable to go through a shoulder injury
7910372 so i stayed behind and did a lot of work with the raising of funds and tents and sleeping bags and things like that to send out to the victims of the earthquake
7910373 but as a long term project we focussed on the small community the schools has been destroyed and we focussed on trying to rebuild
7910374 six months down the line bob came up with the idea of getting a temporary school with the marquees that we took out
7910375 and so the children started their education six months after the earthquake
7910376 and thats carried until last year when the construction of a permanent school was begun and the six classroom girls primary school has been completed
7910377 he said look wed like one of the classrooms to be named people of wales school and i said to him bob if we raise enough money we will call the whole school people of wales school but lets see
7910378 this girls primary school cost 25 000 which is not a lot of money but its a lot of money out there
7910379 tremendous achievement what the people out there have done rebuilding the school and getting things on what will hopefully be a normal way of life for them

7910389 i had to sell them in order to pursue this case
7910390 what else can i do i am not a pimp a coward to let these men get away with what they did i will sell all of my children if that is what it takes to get justice
7910391 i think that a similar effort to the police effort needs to be launched on a similar scope and scale to address the justice issues we have some real problems with corruption in the prisons here there are 10 links between arrest and putting someone in jail the police own the first four links in the process but if you fix the first four links without addressing the next six it wont work
7910392 if the taliban were still here that rapist would have already been executed by now it would have been a lesson for all
7910393 if there is no law and the government does not listen to peoples complaints then it is better to go back to the taliban era at least then we had justice

7910398 but what we have found thus far is only the tip of the iceberg as ive said before use it or lose it is the first principle of arctic sovereignty

7910400 if exceptionally large numbers of illegal immigrants constitute a burden on the countrys judicial system it can allow more time for judicial review
7910401 a good balance between a strict repatriation policy and humanitarian standards in relation to illegal residents
7910402 the european commission and the european court of justice will have a legal base for supporting activities to help illegal immigrants europe has made it clear that we are not tolerating any form of illegal status the european parliament has shown that co decision in the field of justice and home affairs works
7910403 there is agreement on the handling of illegal non eu citizens
7910404 commitment to a human efficient and sustainable management of migration will be taken on by the french eu presidency and put into action
7910405 of course we also would have liked to see a directive that would set higher common standards but political reality shows that by amending this directive we would have ended up with nothing at all it would have given the member states the opportunity to bury the directive illegal migrants would have been the victims of good intentions
7910406 the fundamental rights of persons being removed from eu territory will not be fully guaranteed in this legislative instrument
7910407 while the directive aims to harmonise practices the practical outcome is a codification at eu level of the member states harshest practices and policies
7910408 the cold winds of xenophobia are once again blowing from europe
7910409 what do we have to talk about with a union of countries that criminalises immigrants it will be very hard to talk business and ignore human rights

7910420 the war against terrorism is elsewhere and thats where the war should go
7910421 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7910422 we believe prosocial behavior is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices they seem to care for the welfare of those they know
7910423 we are working with both the other schools through the executive head teacher to make sure that we can get access to the full range of specialist facilities so that the young peoples education and curriculum is as less affected as possible
7910424 brooke informed me two days ago that very soon wed be producing our own version of two and a half men

7910427 because of its focus on female empowerment young women are attracted by wicca popularized by the tv series buffy the vampire slayer in short women are abandoning the church
7910428 achteraf gezien kan je je natuurlijk afvragen of we geen zwaardere maatregelen hadden moeten nemen maar er waren geen indicaties dat er zon drama stond te gebeuren
7910429 de kinderen hadden voldoende structuur in het gezin er was een babysit en familie die mee voor hen zorgde de kinderen laten plaatsen leek ons toen niet gepast ook de politie en het parket vonden die maatregel die toch behoorlijk ingrijpend is niet nodig
7910430 yo no coincido con los elogios a la constituci n que hacen otros como los socialistas que tambi n eran como nosotros de la c scara amarga del franquismo
7910431 el hecho de que las fuerzas armadas aparezcan en la constituci n como garantes de la integridad del territorio y del orden constitucional es intolerable
7910432 que el ej rcito sea garante del orden constitucional es una espina muy gorda para cualquier concepto democr tico
7910433 es una barbaridad que a mi pueblo no se le pueda tener en un sitio donde no quiere estar

7910463 big bang started out with support of clubs and winning over fans with just their music but seeing the great response for them in japan we decided to work together with the company universal studio to bring them into the mainstream market
7910464 with their group and personal schedule in korea they cant advance at full speed into the japanese market but we are trying to phase it out slowly

7910469 more than ever the sat reflects the face of education in this country
7910470 our outreach into minority low income and other underserved student groups is yielding tremendous results
7910471 im ready ive been preparing all season for this moment
7910472 if it does come up ill be happy to get in that position but well see what happens during the week and see what robbie wants to do
7910473 ryan cross has been playing really well well see what happens
7910474 it was good to get some more game time it was a quick game and it was a tough game at the end we just dominated and won the game it was special just going to the stadium the culture here in south africa they love their rugby it was a good experience
7910475 thats all in the past it was a frustrating couple of months in the super 14
7910476 jumping from rugby league to rugby union you cant compare the two games
7910477 there is a lot of thinking at 12 sometimes you are standing at 10 sometimes you are playing on the wing sometimes you are at fullback
7910478 for me the knowledge of the game and playing different positions has been hard but i think im up to scratch now
7910479 if you have a positive coach like him you really want to play for him its a good environment at the moment in the wallabies and everyone wants to play for each other
7910480 if i do start on saturday the team and robbie will have confidence in me and ill have confidence in myself
7910481 id be lying if i said i wouldnt like to go its just a matter of whether its feasible or not
7910482 the way im feeling right now id love to go on im finding it hard to leave it
7910483 while i just cant wait to get home and see the family ill probably sit down with the missus in a years time to talk about london
7910484 i had to overcome a bit of a back injury
7910485 despite that i felt i had that row in me without doing any more damage to the back
7910486 london is still four years away and whether i put myself forward is a good question
7910487 james tomkins is talking about making it a seventh olympics hes not only whispered it but has made mention of it a few times
7910488 ill have a break and reassess where i want to go and where i want to take my swimming
7910489 yes maybe rome thats quite an attractive looking world championships
7910490 i never say never but i am looking at retiring from the sport and moving on with my life
7910491 this one here is a great note to go out on
7910492 im really happy i dragged myself back up over the last couple of years to be a part of it
7910493 havent finished with beijing yet waiting for that to sink in im not looking forward to london yet
7910494 ill probably face him there next year id say unless theres a lead up meet beforehand
7910495 i want to race as much as possible i always have and he pops up every now and then
7910496 there was a lot of disruptions to my preparations over the last four or five years so im starting to get on top of that
7910497 its both my shoulders my right ones gone and my left one is just in constant pain i cant keep playing with needles every game im not doing anyone justice by playing 20 minutes a game its not fair to the team
7910498 to be honest with you i didnt even know what was happening until this morning
7910499 i dont want to say too much but its bad i cant accept it
7910500 i went out there got knocked over by jeff lima and i was seeing stars i came off with a legitimate injury
7910501 i was getting ready to go back on the field so i dont know whats going on
7910502 i had a meeting this afternoon that sorted all that out and its a load of rubbish
7910503 the coaching staff asked him when michael jennings went down that they might need him and he had an interchange card in his hand to go back out
7910504 i spoke to frank after the game and he was in a fair bit of discomfort
7910505 depending on the mri the doctor thinks it would be very very unlikely that he will play again this year
7910506 we got to the bottom of it and his shoulder was no good
7910507 at the end of the day youve probably got to ask the club that
7910508 ive still got two more years there and thats what it is they know where i stand
7910509 kenzie i put my name on it but its for kenzie its her when she goes to kindergarten

7910514 we are at a point in this country where a national campaign is needed to help people realize that they have the opportunity and the ability to make positive and realistic changes in their daily lifestyle choices
7910515 the solution to our health care crisis is prevention and that will only happen when at risk individuals are informed motivated and challenged with a positive realistic and forgiving opportunity to change their behavior
7910516 important benefits accrue for our members partners when they are able to promote a new culture of wellness among their employees their families and the communities they serve we like the fact that lonestart recognizes that we all have the responsibility and the opportunity to make wellness available achievable and sustainable
7910517 we came to realize that most of us want to be well and if we have a reasonable expectation of success we will make positive changes in our daily choices regarding our health
7910518 for the past three years lonestart wellness has been making a difference in several of our member hospitals they have demonstrated that people will respond to the opportunity to make positive choices when those choices are based on valid and easy to apply behavior modification principles as they work toward establishing long term behavior change what started as a grassroots effort has grown into an effective strategy for lasting change based on individual accountability and teamwork
7910519 we are all stakeholders in this effort and together we can turn the epidemic of obesity and inactivity around and reduce our risk for serious chronic illnesses at the same time we can effectively reduce our health care costs and the impact those costs have on our economy
7910520 that 314 billion is roughly equivalent to federal and state spending on the medicaid program each year
7910521 by promoting our individual and collective responsibility to change unhealthy behaviors as a personal and patriotic duty each of us becomes empowered to make our own long term health a priority while at the same time dramatically reducing the burden currently being placed on our health care system lonestart wellness will continue to demonstrate that with imagination vision and initiative a low cost grassroots effort can move us toward a permanent new culture of wellness

7910563 when i was six years old i thought i was the only girl in the whole world who played soccer i wasnt allowed to play because i was a girl
7910564 back then i could never imagine to be a professional player or a professional coach now im sitting with a great player christie rampone and looking at her gold medal i am so proud
7910565 i look at the medal around my neck and its such an accomplishment for this team and the usa and these girls
7910566 it just brought tears to my eyes and im more than thrilled
7910567 if the world were to draw any lessons from what i did
7910568 if you dont like the book ill take full blame if you do like it its not my creation completely
7910569 our people are given the largest possible latitude for their convictions and if a man rejects a message that i may give to him but is still moral and believes in the main principles of the gospel and desires to continue in his membership in the church he is permitted to remain and he is not unchurched it is only those who on rejecting a revelation rebel against the church and withdraw from the church at their own volition
7910570 they told me i think two are living today but they are not known as his children as they go by other names
7910571 what is it about this point of view that people find appealing or inspiring or true
7910572 i can bear testimony to the importance of these because of the benjamin franklin papers during masters thesis he came across a period of time that was already completed in the franklin papers it was a goldmine of information we want things that accessible
7910573 developed methods and benchmarks of thoroughness and accuracy for documentary publication that were so path breaking that all previous such publication was rendered inadequate and incomplete and all subsequent such publication has had to try to live up to those standards
7910574 what has been achieved thus far with the publication of the documents of us founders is all good history accurate history because materials have been brought together by fine scholars their value is unassailable and immeasurable the footnotes are gold
7910575 if its not credible to scholars its not worth doing
7910576 if its not accessible to saints its not worth doing
7910577 i will never forgive joseph smith for having assigned a doctor as his scribe
7910578 the closer you get to joseph smith in the sources the stronger he will appear rather than the reverse as is so often assumed by critics
7910579 a documentary book is only as good as its index
7910580 im not stupid im not a fool and im not an uncle tom this gospel is for all people
7910581 there was no way in hell i was going to baptized into the lds church
7910582 lord we want only what is right were not making any plans to be spectacularly moving we want only the thing that thou dost want
7910583 how could any man assume that he is worthy of the priesthood and that another man with different color is not eligible based on race
7910584 you havent done your part by reading the book yet
7910585 will the constitution be destroyed no it will be held inviolate by this people
7910586 when the nations shall be convulsed we may stand forth as saviours and do that which will be best calculated to produce the well being of the human family and finally redeem a ruined world not only in a religious but in a political point of view
7910587 preported vision or revelation that proceeds out of darkness etc
7910588 broken sentences from the prophet joseph smith that they might have heard from time to time and formulated this prophecy
7910589 a false and deceptive document that has cropped up again and again
7910590 if i had a revelation id tell you ive never spoken with god id be doggone pissed off if anyone said that
7910591 its very hard to say how i am feeling and the truth is i am numb at the moment
7910592 i am very proud at this moment not only for myself but also for the country
7910593 ten meter air rifle is a very slippery sport with fierce competition and i am really happy that i was able to perform on the given day
7910594 this being my third olympics experience was also a big factor since i knew what an olympic competition was all about
7910595 i would like to dedicate my gold medal to bring hope and determination in all my fellow athletes who should now believe that there is a possibility and strive to bring many more laurels for our country
7910596 it is difficult to find a person who has come up with his back injury in such a good form and brought such a big laurel to the country
7910597 he had lumborum problem which can force anybody sitting or standing here to take rest for at least six months
7910598 after taking a break for six months this guy has really come up very well and firstly won world championship and today he has brought gold for the nation with a bang
7910599 there may be parts of the speech that arent going to get a lot of applause but ive got to say what i believe will get out country back on the right path
7910600 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that
7910601 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7910602 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7910603 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7910604 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7910605 to discuss ways in which his foundation is addressing some of the worlds most pressing problems
7910606 president clinton understands this is sen obamas convention and he is here to do all he can to make sen obama our next president
7910607 were talking about the nominee for the president of the united states
7910608 he benji actually helped me write some of the songs for my new album and for the bff show hes a really amazing talent songwriter and singer
7910609 they want to see if there is any interest there
7910610 i was told all along that if something were to happen that this is a position i could find myself in
7910611 i am ready to step in there and hopefully there wont be a letdown at all
7910612 we are going to go forward with the players that we have
7910613 and we are always looking for and searching for people who can help our team and nothing is going to change with regard to that
7910614 i would have done whatever to try to get him back initially but now how could you not want him back
7910615 wouldnt that be something he comes back and we start a trend
7910616 as i know it he is probably on a beach somewhere sipping on some pina coladas so i doubt football is the first thing on his mind today
7910617 he has not been bouncing back and forth like favre
7910618 he has been pretty happy we saw him up here and he said he missed it but he was content he has decided to go on to the next phase of his life so i dont look too strongly into that him playing again
7910619 it is something that he all of us really wanted but obviously we didnt want these circumstances for him to get back
7910620 it is a good thing for him it is a good thing for this team he is definitely a d lineman at heart and hopefully he can just come back in and not miss a beat
7910621 he is another one of those infectious personalities so his personality and his mind state are always going to be at the utmost highest so i am not worried about him on that point
7910622 eran tan graves sus lesiones que fue imposible salvarle la vida
7910623 su cuadro era muy cr tico las lesiones eran tantas y tan graves que se hizo imposible salvar su vida
7910624 el d a que ingres se le practic una neurocirug a una intervenci n en el t rax y otra en el abdomen
7910625 immature love says i love you because i need you
7910626 hey your comics are simple to draw why dont you just put out a bunch
7910627 its very much in line with the original strategy to fold much of the legacy hp services capability into the eds management framework
7910628 callers to the helpline are guaranteed to hear the voice of another older person at the end of the line
7910629 in summer a lot of people are isolated as family are on holidays and that coupled with the misery of the weather has kept our volunteers very busy our volunteers are dealing with a lot of difficult calls about depression it is hard for callers because families are away
7910630 most people slept the whole time all the partying was done in beijing
7910631 some sports get a living allowance so they can train and compete it would be good if kayaking got a bit more of the funding pie
7910632 as you would expect healthy debate exists and is pretty standard within any board
7910633 im not sure if youve noticed but we havent won 15 premierships so we need to continue to challenge the status quo
7910634 im not going to comment on individual board members the board is all about football first and well continue to be about putting football first and nothing will distract us
7910635 speculation about archie and the gold coast doesnt surprise me at all hes a very good ceo
7910636 lost confidence in the fairfax board and its ability to manage the company through these challenging financial times when its only strategy is to cut editorial staff again and again
7910637 we believe fairfax is abandoning the quality journalism market leaving a hollow ring to david kirks commitment to uphold these values
7910638 media companies fit for the modern media world need to be lean and agile
7910639 management is clearly struggling to deal with how to handle the complex demands of high end quality journalism
7910640 our newspapers will remain true to their heritage and their values of quality and excellence
7910641 in a week when weve invested in the product and we continue to invest in our people the story out of fairfax is that theyre cutting 550 jobs
7910642 to lose 80 journalists i struggle to see how you can do that without affecting quality
7910643 what would produce a solid financial return yesterday will not do so tomorrow
7910644 in the release of our annual results you would have noticed that the metropolitan mastheads financial position has declined
7910645 when you win in three sets it is a good result
7910646 i had some difficult moments in the match so that is going to help me be prepared for the pressure moments later on
7910647 he was hitting his forehand really hard and making me do a bit of running
7910648 it was a decent test and i came through it pretty well
7910649 two or three months ago the body was starting to not recover as well as it has in the past and it took me a lot longer to get up throughout the week
7910650 ive never had the quickest legs and theyre slowly starting to go as well
7910651 ive always pretty much wanted to go out on my own terms i dont think theres anything worse than going that extra year or two and end up running around in the vfl thats something i didnt want to do
7910652 i think when you get to this stage of your career you know deep down when the right time is to retire
7910653 its such a strong quick game these days and youve really got to be on your toes
7910654 from a personal point of view i still feel like ive got some time left
7910655 im not hanging my hat on getting a spot at an afl club next year but im definitely putting my hand up to say look my mind feels good my body feels good i want to continue playing
7910656 every australian is proud of you every man woman and child in this nation is proud of each and every one of you
7910657 for those of us who may be going to london start preparing
7910658 top five will be the objective again im sure but personally i think our objective should be to beat the british even at home
7910659 theres been some studies apparently by previous governments of this i havent seen them which have said it may not work
7910660 but we want to have another look at it because its a positive constructive idea
7910661 im just hanging out to get to melbourne to be with my parents and have my mum cook up one of her barbecues
7910662 i want to have a crack at the world record over the next couple of years
7910663 were off to the us where ill take my wife shopping in new york down to miami and then across to vegas
7910664 i need a couple of months off maybe november ill get back in the water
7910665 id also love to go to the afl grand final that would be kind of fun
7910666 im going back to brisbane on friday because its my 23rd birthday on saturday so i can celebrate that
7910667 the program is a very important step in the development of the 24 hour news centre and i am happy to step in and help
7910668 at the moment i dont think its diminished its increased
7910669 just look at all these functions that are being put on apart from anything else
7910670 the first was somewhat difficult to come to grips with but bradman regularly delivered you glorious evidence of his omnipotence
7910671 it is one thing to laud the scale of his run scoring it is another to contemplate that its like will never be seen again
7910672 yet nobody has come close to emulating bradman by any yardstick of batsmen to have played 20 test innings none averages above 70 only four above 60 it is irksome that bradman will always stand alone of course because as bolt showed so marvellously we want to improve on those who came before without at all deriding their achievements that is the fun but all studies of bradman and they are by now countless point to his uniqueness
7910673 at least the 100th one doesnt come around too often im feeling pretty good at the moment but i dont think i will worry about the next one
7910674 it continues to surprise me and always will essentially because im my fathers son and it always surprised him
7910675 i remember him first and foremost as a father of course and i think thats the same for everybody the memory of our parents doesnt diminish
7910676 it continues on through our life and its the same for my kids they remember him as a grandfather and it continues on for them
7910677 i think the most precious thing in retrospect was when he gave up everything and stayed at home to look after me when i got polio i would have been institutionalised if he didnt and the effect of that on the lives of young people was very significant
7910678 that was a pretty remarkable thing for any man to do back then
7910679 there was a real sense of panic it was an epidemic it was such an unknown thing and that is something i remember with an immense appreciation i appreciated it at the time but more as time passes
7910680 don bradman says you have to do this so you can get better
7910681 he was never somebody who was tied to the past he was always able to move with change
7910682 gr ten weltweiten volksverdummung und v lkerverdummungsaktion die man im sport bisher gesehen hat

7910684 but people who are skeptical of big integrations will have a field day around this its putting together two large businesses with two different heritages its going to be a big culture clash
7910685 its somewhat amusing because weve seen this play before i think this is sort of further evidence that hp really does see value at scale basically at size
7910686 founder and lead developer of librarything tim spalding notes that
7910687 russland ist der wichtigste wachstumsmarkt in europa er wird im jahr 2008 deutschland berholen und dann gr ter automarkt in europa sein
7910688 der automarkt spiegelt die gro en einkommensunterschiede im land kaviar und trockenfisch
7910689 die produktion des k nftigen gemeinschaftsunternehmens entspricht der starken nachfrage in diesen beiden segmenten in russland entfallen auf mittelklassewagen knapp 50 prozent des absatzes und die suv geh ren zu den besonders wachstumsstarken segmenten
7910690 wer nicht in russland ist kann vom markt nur halbherzig profitieren da russland einfuhrz lle von 26 prozent f r pkw hat
7910691 bei den deutschen herstellern ist mercedes der einzige der noch nicht in russland fahrzeuge baut das ist f r mercedes ein strategisches risiko
7910692 daimler w rde dabei die technische kompetenz des globalen branchenf hrers einbringen w hrend kamaz ber anlagen vertriebsstrukturen und ein gutes netzwerk vor ort verf gt
7910693 die deutsche wirtschaft ger t damit zunehmend in konjunkturell schwieriges fahrwasser
7910694 i will operate an open and transparent government that would be humble enough to accept its failings and will not praise itself to the high heavens when it meets the hopes and aspirations of the people because that is what i would have been given the mandate to do
7910695 we have not heard him say this in the ashanti region or in the eastern region we have not heard professor john evans atta mills ndc presidential candidate say this in the volta region or the northern region
7910696 for the sake of the nations unity we are asking the ndc and npp flag bearers to go to those regions and others to ask the people to listen to the message examine the qualities of the candidates and consider the track records of political parties and vote for the one that is most deserving without regard to ethnic considerations
7910697 that is why the concept of edwumawura and asking the people to give the party the opportunity to come and lead the nation with its job creation strategies so that the people in the region can also benefit
7910698 the region has tourism farming and fishing opportunities that have been neglected with the many educational institutions sited there the central region could easily become a technology centre for the country
7910699 the region has lost several thousands of jobs due to the closing down of the saltpond ceramic factory numerous brick factories the sugar factory in komenda a bamboo products factory many state farms that today would be major large scale farms and many others
7910700 the fishing industry has been left without serious attention and thus has resulted in making hard working fishermen poor now that the election season is upon us those who have had the opportunity to do something about it have all of a sudden discovered the problems and making promises left and right to solve the regions problems
7910701 but theres this question is obama fit for the job
7910702 speaking to the convention crowd michelle talked not just of the candidate who could be president but of the guy she married
7910703 there is to mr obamas story a steinbeck quality like so many migratory american tales the mother who flickers in and out the absent and iconic father the grandfather raised in the roughneck kansas oil town of el dorado who moves the family restlessly ceaselessly westward
7910704 the american dna encodes wanderlust ambition and a romance clings to mr obamas story the roamer who would make himself and his land anew is a familiar archetype
7910705 mr obama would be the first president elected whose worldview took shape in a post cold war post great society period he is fond of reminding audiences he was just 9 as the curtain fell on the 1960s his suggestion is that he is not captive to old culture wars
7910706 much of mr obamas politics his opposition to the war and support for raising taxes on the wealthy and his support of abortion and labor rights falls squarely in the liberal mainstream but his ideological departures are noteworthy

7910708 what you think we didnt have one before today while were still not sure when youll be able to walk into a rogers store to actually buy the shiny new device like simon did today still marks the official launch of the blackberry bold on rogers in honor of this special day weve decided to post our exhaustive review if only to whet your appetites
7910709 this is a sensitive time and we need to make sure we reach a solution one way or another
7910710 everything is going well and a deal can be reached the differences we have are ones we can solve and in the next two or three days there has to be a solution because there is no more time
7910711 there is a team which is offering what we have asked and another one which isnt but the player is interested in the one which is offering the least
7910712 i am not even considering the option of liverpool not qualifying for the group stages i am just thinking about winning my concern now is to improve how we play we can play better liege were good in the first leg but we were really poor
7910713 at anfield we are confident we can win and i expect us to win
7910714 but yes i am aware of the financial implications of liverpool not qualifying money is really important but that is always the situation in football the key is to do the right things have confidence and then we will not be thinking about such things as not qualifying i am confident that will not be the case
7910715 technical expertise will further enhance the attractive growth potential of the business
7910716 additionally we view this as an important opportunity to expand on the continuing co operation between russia and india in the energy sector
7910717 although we may sometimes be ashamed to admit it the slave trade is an integral part of british history
7910718 it is inextricably linked to trade colonisation industrialisation and the british empire
7910719 it is important that children learn about this and the links to wider world history such as the american civil rights movement the repercussions of which are still being felt today
7910720 that is why the slave trade will join the british empire two world wars and the holocaust as compulsory parts of the secondary school history curriculum from this september
7910721 learning about slavery and associated issues such as trade and decolonisation is crucial so that young people can fully understanding the shape of todays world
7910722 however it is vital that the government provides better guidance and support to teachers so that they can teach these complex and difficult topics with confidence and success

7910757 the nes is a perfect example of a complex geospatial data supply chain being simplified the results are higher quality data being delivered in a more timely fashion ultimately resulting in efficiency gains for all parties involved

7910764 settlement activity is not conducive to creating an environment for negotiations
7910765 should not be affected by any kind of settlement activities
7910766 the role of leaders is to try and find a way to live in peace in the future and not to let any kind of noise that relates to the situation on the ground to enter the negotiating room
7910767 at the end of the day the israeli government policy is not to expand settlements it is not to build new settlements not to confiscate land from palestinians

7910777 nine year old jericho scott is a good baseball player too good it turns out
7910778 they say his hard throws may frighten other players in the the baseball league
7910779 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7910780 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7910781 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
7910782 this indicates that more young people are being detained and that they are in detention for longer the aihw said

7910808 well you seemed to have difficulty in asking a blessing on the bread has something happened
7910809 a few hours ago i was over germany and france on a bombing mission we had made our run left our calling cards meaning the bombs and when we gained altitude and were about to return across the channel we ran into heavy flak my tail assembly was pretty well shot away one of my engines was out a number of my crew were wounded and it looked like a hopeless situation it seemed like no power in heaven or earth could get us back across the channel to a landing field but
7910810 brother brown up there i remembered what my mother had said to me and this i want to say to this vast audience both those that are here and those that are listening in this is what my mother said if ever you find yourself in a situation where man cant help you call on god
7910811 when i heard of this meeting i ran all the way to get here and when i knelt at the table and named his name again i remembered shamefully that i had not stopped to say thank you and thats the reason i paused to express my gratitude for the goodness of god
7910812 well have to dismiss or you wont get any chow
7910813 we can have chow any time lets have a testimony meeting

7910817 how do you do it how did you know which of those fellows to call on
7910818 it didnt make any difference which one i called on they are all prepared and this could happen in any camp anywhere in the world where there are seventy five young mormon boys
7910819 thou art the christ the son of the living god

7910854 its time to vote the effect of matching message orientation and temporal frame on political persuasion
7910855 imagine taking a vacation to cancun six months from now
7910856 similarly a voter facing a choice in the distant future is less interested in particular plans and policies and is more persuaded by broad abstract ideas
7910857 it is only as the election gets closer that voters start paying attention to concrete details of the candidates positions in essence when the choice is far away a voter is more likely to think in abstract terms but as the choice approaches the voter puts more weight on the details
7910858 what this finding implies is that the people who typically decide elections voters in the middle are most susceptible to this type of persuasion
7910859 political novices tend to be more persuaded by abstract messages when the choice is far off and by concrete messages when the choice is imminent
7910860 the fit of the right message with the right voter at the right time has never been more important to the outcome of a race

7911027 there are already several new improved versions of the kindle in the works
7911028 this is the main reason for the fall in the uninsured rate for children and for the fall in the overall uninsured rate
7911029 the fall in private insurance was similar to recent years that fall was offset by the rise in government insurance

7911059 threat to the rubber hand can induce a similar level of activity in the brain areas associated with anxiety and interoceptive awareness insula and anterior cingulate cortex as when the persons real hand is threatened we further show that the stronger the feeling of ownership of the artificial hand the stronger the threat evoked neuronal responses in the areas reflecting anxiety
7911060 were just trying to marry independence with service and be cost effective at the same time
7911061 ive been caught between whats best for the summit house and whats best for the residents
7911062 together between our staff and girling staff we should be a complete community for seniors
7911063 this will be more cost effective residents wont have to pay for nurses services unless need it
7911064 they would have to pay for services automatically if they moved into an assisted living facility
7911065 as my seniors age in place they dont want to move again thats been a concern that anxiety has now somewhat gone away
7911066 corporate knows we have a need for services they see it as a way for summit house to move forward
7911067 so together we could provide everything assisted living does the resident remains independent and they choose ala carte what services they want

7911073 ayers committed his crimes when obambi was only 8 years old
7911074 damn this bloody ad could really hurt us if people notice it say ive got an idea why dont we stir up a controversy over it and make sure that all the news networks have to carry it in order to let the viewers know what theyre talking about
7911075 other stations that follow sinclairs lead should expect a similar response from people who dont want the political discourse cheapened with these false negative attacks
7911076 nice little station you got there itd be a great pity if something were to happen to it dont you think like your mail servers getting buried in a sudden influx of angry emails or i dont know maybe a criminal investigation

7911089 its working exactly the way it is supposed to do
7911090 at one point we didnt know what we were going to do we were going to get arrested or maced
7911091 i havent been able to vote for a president yet but this was an epiphany
7911092 a bunch of us were supposed to have a direct action march
7911093 were not going to let them stop you were not going to let them intimidate you but we are emphasizing peace and nonviolence we dont want trouble in denver tonight
7911094 when i saw the tear gas i split i dont need to get beat down
7911095 the spray will fuse your contact lenses to your eyeballs
7911096 we want direct democracy where communities are allowed to make decisions based on our own abilities it takes bottom up organizing to make change it doesnt take a leader we want cooperations not capitalism
7911097 come ready for quick decentralized actions spanning the downtown area at a variety of risk levels
7911098 i tried to get out but it was only when i started crying that they met me out
7911099 it is important that when the club has done something good for you you do something good for the club
7911100 the reason i left bayern is because i didnt get the minutes i wish i had
7911101 the lads here give me the confidence to believe that my body is 100 okay and to play as well as i used to
7911102 now im very relaxed and confident that this season can be as good as the last one especially because i feel good in training
7911103 for me it was always clear before signing the deal i had three years to go with blackburn so the club were the ones deciding what happens with my future
7911104 they understand that im very ambitious but what they offer is the chance for me to become a better player
7911105 hay que eliminar las contratistas eso es capitalismo salvaje vienen unos se ores crean una empresa van y contratan a los trabajadores le pagan una miseria ni siquiera salario m nimo no tienen seguridad social los explotan como si fueran esclavos y ellos se llevan la gran tajada
7911106 s es factible tenemos experiencia la cual ya es bastante grande hemos negociado con estados unidos que es inmenso como china y este pa s tiene posibilidades muy grandes
7911107 tambi n tenemos que entender que ellos china tienen ciertos intereses que tenemos que ponderar es un tema de negociaci n
7911108 my idea that i was safe was completely shaken and destroyed but im trying to build it back
7911109 all i can think about is going back to school because im anxious to start classes
7911110 theres more of a sense of community now and i feel like im a part of it i feel like thats my home and thats where i should be
7911111 we have a very good relationship with the students here
7911112 we will certainly be vigilant in the way we do our policing
7911113 i dont go in with any ill will or any kind of fear i have faith in my faculty and the people around me
7911114 i think that a lot of it had to do with the fact that i dealt with kids the whole summer
7911115 i got a sense of what other people were doing in response which was helpful to see
7911116 if anything its more positive because i was able to witness the community outreach
7911117 it just cast a really somber shadow over the class
7911118 going into the summer i kind of stepped away from everything that happened leaving town was kind of like leaving it behind for a while
7911119 that was one of the major questions i had for dr dorothy
7911120 i feel i reached the point that i can get to that next level
7911121 this is the picture of jesus i was telling you about
7911122 get on with your business were okay and dont worry about us
7911123 with katrina i dont think weve hit the bottom yet
7911124 im not sure that people have really with katrina have said yes there really is a light at the end of the tunnel and i can see it and its not another train coming at me
7911125 i think were look at another five to six years before we see that were back up to where we were pre katrina
7911126 i think we have become somewhat fatigued because it is so demanding all the time
7911127 if we try to deny those feelings and resist those feelings then we cannot begin the recovery process
7911128 i think yes the signs are we are going to be okay
7911129 im trying to put a future in front of me where i can have goals and achieve those goals
7911130 you just move on down the road and trying to be a good man and a good christian
7911131 we knew there were issues with stefan going back to last spring weve talked through it with him and we havent had any success
7911132 considered to be one of the top prospects in all of hockey and a well known player in canada because of his high energy agitating play and his off ice humor
7911133 look hes a kid with an enormous amount of talent and skill well a lot of other people have the skill to be a great doctor and yet they decide they dont want to be a doctor anymore hes a 19 year old who maybe has to grow up a little bit yet its not a health issue not as far as i know he wont be attending training camp hes taking time to think things over in my opinion stefan just wants to take a break hes tired from all the things hes gone through the last two seasons all the tournaments the games the shoulder injury all that stuff he feels like he needs some time and space
7911134 when does training camp start sept 19 or 20 until sept 20 he hasnt quit anything
7911135 absolutely yes i think were dealing with a case of burnout here you cant be filled with that much passion for the sport of hockey and decide right like that that youre done with it i think hes going to play again in fact i think when the frost hits the ground hes going to get the itch
7911136 i cant say hes in the process of reconsidering no hes not in the process of anything right now to be honest with you
7911137 i can tell them that we bought the team to have it here in columbus were dedicated to keeping it in columbus but i cant offer guarantees i am reasonably comfortable that well be here for a long time certainly every fiber of what we try to do is to fulfill that original thought my father worked on various sports commissions for probably 35 years to get a pro team for this town it was one of his dreams now sometimes in life you have to do what you have to do but i would consider it a personal defeat if we ended up in that situation

7911141 what martin did diminishes the dignity of a human being you cant just buy or rent life its even worse when someone famous and in the public eye is doing it
7911142 i dont think its right to deny children of maternal figures just because you have a big ego
7911143 the new security plan should also include shia cities like hwaider khirnabat and abara
7911144 the forces of the new security plan took all our weapons to the extent that we cannot fight al qaeda any more we are impotent
7911145 no shia vip or layman has been arrested since the launch of the security plan
7911146 we all know that shia militias in baquba are a source of instability
7911147 influential shia members in the provincial office or in the ruling council were behind the bad security situation in this province it cannot be that all of them are innocent
7911148 part 3 especially part 3 where i cried throughout writing the post
7911149 life like war is a series of mistakes and he is not the best christian nor the best general who makes the fewest false steps poor mediocrity may secure that but he is the best who wins the most splendid victories by the retrieval of mistakes forget mistakes organize victory out of mistakes

7911151 in the broad sense the earths climate is determined by solar radiation
7911152 there is now little doubt that solar wind variability streams of ionized gases that radiate out from the sun is the primary cause of climate change on a decadal time scale
7911153 we are not concerned about hundreds of thousands of years or millennia we are concerned about decades in the study because we are interested in what fits the human life span
7911154 it looks as if solar activity not solar radiation itself determines what happens with the climate
7911155 by disregarding or ignoring the very much larger changes of solar ultraviolet or of the solar wind and its magnetic field effect on cosmic rays and thus on cloud coverage the ipcc has managed to trivialize the climate effects of solar variability
7911156 anything that falls beyond the purview of anthropogenic human caused global warming is not going to be seriously investigated by the ipcc
7911157 thats why the ipcc should never be viewed as a scientific manual it was created for the sole purpose of supporting the notion of human induced climate change
7911158 although the rarity of the current episode of high average sunspot numbers may indicate that the sun has contributed to the unusual climate change during the twentieth century we point out that solar variability is unlikely to have been the dominant cause of the strong warming during the past three decades
7911159 whats controversial in my view is not the fact that solar activity affects the climate but the exact mechanism the details
7911160 theres overwhelming evidence its also in my report that solar activity varying on a time scale of decades produces corresponding affects on the climate on decadal scale

7911172 complied with everything the irs has asked us to do
7911173 its very sad to see the corporate world join the media as one of the two main promoters of gay rights in america
7911174 rather than fight for principle rather than stand up for family values or even consider the cost of embracing same sex couples and especially for men there is a medical cost there hiv aids is a cost rather than consider any of those they just capitulate to the homosexual agenda
7911175 biden certainly split and criticized with the bush administration but he supported the decision to overthrow saddam hussein and supported it quite consistently
7911176 hes been critical in the period since then but of course senator obamas position is we never should have started the war to begin with
7911177 because of that the democrat party has moved further and further to the left and has really adopted the homosexual lobbys wish list in its entirety

7911221 well were really far behind this generation so why dont we hurry up and get to the next one and try our luck there
7911222 it the performance was all pre recorded and the m s o did record a minority of the music that was performed
7911223 its correct that we were basically miming to a pre recording
7911224 there are millions of people watching and if something goes wrong youd be snookered
7911225 you simply cant embarrass yourself on the world stage you must do whatever you can to make it perfect
7911226 everyone should understand this in this way mr chen said this is in the national interest it is the image of our national music national culture especially during the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important extremely serious matter
7911227 execution error microsoft jscript undifined is null or is not an object
7911228 w e respect the right of elected officials such as speaker pelosi to address matters of public policy that are before them but the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops
7911229 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7911230 t he catechism of the catholic church is clear the current teaching of the catholic church on human life and abortion is the same teaching as it was 2 000 years ago
7911231 it depends on the bishop of a certain region and fortunately for me communion has not been withheld and im a regular communicant so that would be a severe blow to me if that were the case
7911232 je mapplique volontier penser aux choses auxquelles je pense que les autres ne penseront pas

7911234 the technology is very innovative and what makes it unique is that the client side is extremely small just 300kb
7911235 it operates over a patent pending peer to peer architecture because its so small were able to wrap it in java and have it accessed by any browser on the pc and mac support is about 3 months away as were moving into web based virtual worlds now we have an embeddable voice solution to work with that
7911236 thats the fundamental difference for babblestream the advantage is that you can embed babblestreamw ith your google lively session and then invite friends via email because it operates in a browser you dont need to download a client like google talk for example and disclose your identity you can just show up to a link and maintain that anonymity that people get in a virtual world
7911237 it was too much to hope for that he might be an obama delegate in fact he lives in denver and was a representative to the u s commission on civil rights he says until george w bush canned him but he actually is a democrat and a highly enthusiastic obama supporter
7911238 a representative to the u s commission on civil rights
7911239 cindy is not here today and im sorry shes not
7911240 shes on her way to the little country of georgia
7911241 georgia back in the third century the king of georgia converted to christianity you see churches there that date back to the fourth and fifth century
7911242 it puts russia of course in opposition to a number of security council resolutions to which it is party most appallingly as a member of the p 5
7911243 we obviously cant allow what russias done to go without there being some consequences
7911244 it simply means that the russian president continues not to honor the commitments that the russians have signed on to
7911245 while there have been some significant russian movements they are not yet living up to the terms of the cease fire agreement
7911246 more than ever the sat reflects the face of education in this country
7911247 our outreach into minority low income and other underserved student groups is yielding tremendous results
7911248 in the past there was a case in which a convert from islam to christianity was sentenced to death in yemen
7911249 because of the pressure from the international community the person was finally released
7911250 senator obama saying the question of when life begins is above his pay grade if he were to come to you and say help me out here madame speaker when does life begin what would you tell him
7911251 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
7911252 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and senator st augustine said at three months we dont know
7911253 the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose roe v wade talks about very clear definitions of when the child first trimester certain considerations second trimester not so third trimester theres very clear distinctions this isnt about abortion on demand its about a careful careful consideration of all factors and to that a woman has to make with her doctor and her god
7911254 the catholic church at the moment feels very strongly that it begins at the point of conception
7911255 over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7911256 here is what the catechism of the catholic church says human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception
7911257 it also says since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable looks like pelosi didnt study the subject long enough but not to worry we are sending her a copy of catholicism for dummies today
7911258 its the blind leading the blind in that party if the ardent practicing catholic doesnt care when life begins only that women have the choice to do what they choose sometimes thanks to people like pelosi not aware of what their choices actually are whether its life or not

7911260 i havent gotten a line out of vegas but id say pretty good
7911261 thats part of the thought process to have multiple guys that can fill in
7911262 you saw last week we worked a lot of guys in a lot of different spots in the secondary to build that flexibility
7911263 i was kind of shocked but i knew most of the stuff
7911264 it was just a matter of going out there seeing it and knowing what to do
7911265 being in the back end is a little different from being on the corner on the island the whole time so you have to get used to it
7911266 i think i played good there are always things you can improve on but overall i feel like i played really well
7911267 all you have to do is look at the tape and improve on the things you need to improve on so you can keep setting the bar high
7911268 i look at it as its a situation for me just coming in and competing its really not up to me whether im a starter or im a backup
7911269 the only thing i can control is what i do day in and day out
7911270 i think that comes from understanding what the other guys are supposed to do too and understanding where you fit into the defense and what we are trying to execute and what we are trying to get done with the defenses that are getting called
7911271 you get to a certain point where you feel like you can anticipate what our coach is going to call
7911272 im going to return full fledged im looking forward to it im excited
7911273 i wasnt there last year im hoping the fans didnt forget me
7911274 its amazing fans are making all kinds of sounds then one guy stands up and everybody gets quiet and he starts moving his arms forming letters and a whole stadium spells out the teams name as one
7911275 people think i was giving up i didnt want to come it wasnt that believe me
7911276 whatever the record was it didnt matter i was biting at the bit every sunday it was killing me that i couldnt be there
7911277 i thought i might try to come back for the last couple of games
7911278 of course between me and the other firemen playing ball all those years the bodys getting worn down but the heart is still ticking and ive still got that passion ive still got that burning desire
7911279 when a touchdown is scored thats obvious so many other times you have to pick and choose you dont want to tick people off during the game
7911280 and the defensive chants are the hardest to come by youve got to get people up from sitting on their butts its a homefield edge the players feed off that
7911281 watching brett favre that close he just zips the ball
7911282 other guys throw a pass that wont be that tight a spiral it happens but it seems like every single pass with him its a tight spiral if you wanted to teach a kid how to throw a ball that would be the guy to show him and take the gray hair away and that guy is awesome shape tremendous shape
7911283 but you know whats more refreshing than anything with favre im just amazed at his humbleness a guy with all those accolades at that level for so long a time to be as humble and grounded as he is we went from a guy like chad pennington who just represented the organization so well to another guy whos on the same level even a better more accomplished guy
7911284 the stadium for new england is going to be in a frenzy
7911285 this is a great time to be a jets fan
7911286 i think this is all posturing by the mccain committee and the mccain campaign to try and assuage democrats and try and win independents over and sort of get this talk going
7911287 but i agree 1 000 percent i dont think that any republican candidate could run with a democrat no matter how friendly
7911288 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay
7911289 in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit
7911290 in the name of your son jesus who gave his own life against the forces of injustice
7911291 look if its there great if its not eat the ball and eat up the time
7911292 go and get healthy thats the priority and thats what you have to take care of dont worry about things here you need to take care of this this is the most important thing because without your health none of the other stuff matters
7911293 hey take a look at this group here and let me know what you think
7911294 hey what do you think about this whats your opinion here
7911295 her olympic success has perhaps helped to change the face of prejudice almost a taboo subject in a modern australia
7911296 her olympic reception following victory in the final of the 400 meter dash may be viewed in stark contrast to the day she traveled to a meet at age 13 waiting outside melbournes flinders street station she was ordered to move on by a group of middle aged white housewives when the whole adjacent seating area lay vacant as cathy freeman held the olympic torch aloft during the opening ceremony of the 2000 sydney olympic games she did so in an allegedly different australia from the one experienced by her parents
7911297 in los angeles in 1984 the average security cost was 11 627 per athlete or 14 per ticket two decades later in athens where there were an estimated 10 500 participants the average cost was 142 857 per athlete or 283 per ticket
7911298 the final gold medal for authoritarian image management can already be safely awarded to chinas communist party leadership
7911299 when the chinese government raised the minimum wage in dongguan province in order to account for a skyrocketing inflation rate on basic goods like food employers at many of the athletic footwear factories studied by play fair found ways to nullify the increase some employers raised production targets thereby reducing or eliminating production bonuses a significant portion of worker incomes others introduced new charges for food lodging or other services some of the workers interviewed now receive less income than before the minimum wage increase
7911300 a stunning betrayal of the anti war constituency who made possible his hard fought victory in the democratic primaries and caucuses
7911301 biden who chaired the senate foreign relations committee during the lead up to the iraq war during the latter half of 2002 was perhaps the single most important congressional backer of the bush administrations decision to invade that oil rich country
7911302 the most important reason to take change seriously is that the obama campaign is bigger than the candidate
7911303 this is its saving grace through the media the public has been taught to be skeptical of real change the incipient movement to buck that socialization is the grandest achievement of the obama campaign so far relations of mutual respect in the hemisphere dont depend just on presidential elections they depend on a reactivation of civil society in the americas at a critical moment for the region
7911304 we seek out the comfortable middle at our own peril not too hot and not too cold not too hard and not too soft its a strategy guaranteed to lull anyone into a dangerous complacency
7911305 what we found most disturbing about the summit is how this group of jews and christians democrats and republicans managed to get past their differences to unite against their muslim enemy
7911306 we never heard any of the panelists explicitly say muslims are evil
7911307 israeli officials acknowledge that it would be difficult to launch such an attack without approval from russia china and india something that the united states would have to lobby those nations to achieve
7911308 the chances at present are extremely slim that any of the three will acquiesce
7911309 these developments are occurring largely despite not because of u s efforts
7911310 there has been a marked diminution of u s influence in the region as local actors continue to harbor considerable skepticism about u s motives at the same time european influence has increased in particular france whose mediterranean union initiative launched in july includes israel and the palestinians as well as turkey and key arab states ironically as these events unfold and despite disappointing u s policies there is still room for america to engage more fully in shaping positive outcomes in the region
7911311 with fallujah however there were no damning photographs broadcast on television screens across the country there were no congressional hearings
7911312 perhaps the one small consolation is that musharrafs resignation is the first time that formal parliamentary proceedings have unseated a military head of state in pakistan
7911313 he has been as bloodlessly removed as he was self installed the predominant fear in washington is that pakistan will lose its focus on the war on terrorism now that it is controlled not by one man but by numerous competing centers of power but even at his height musharraf appeared unwilling or incapable of challenging the elements within pakistans army that have been nurturing militancy
7911314 moons customary low profile does allow some possibilities for his good offices
7911315 some form of un mission could allow both sides to descend with dignity from the poles they have climbed a good example would be the brokering role the un played in ending the iran iraq war such quiet diplomacy in concert with un monitors and peacekeepers could produce a durable settlement without asking any of the parties to eat humble pie
7911316 rovers will not be pursuing an interest in bolton goalkeeper ali al habsi
7911317 its a tough tournament to win rafa has never been beyond the quarters so thats definitely the advantage i carry to the other players
7911318 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s open
7911319 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time being no 1 so it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and hes played so well on all surfaces now
7911320 maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having no 1 next to me and it should be interesting
7911321 basically i am offering myself as a model of that
7911322 i know he loves his children but i dont know the meaning of all things
7911323 i was led by the spirit not knowing beforehand the things i should do
7911324 i am mystified about the thought process that put these things together
7911325 who are you where wast thou when i lay the foundation of the earth
7911326 it is vain to serve god we call the proud happy they that fear the lord were heard though and a book was written for them that feared the lord and they will be spared then shall they return and discern between the righteous and the wicked
7911327 be ready always to give an answer with meekness and fear
7911328 its not the critic who counts the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena if he fails he fails with those who tried
7911329 what i like to do is to have the enemy for lunch
7911330 farms admits that joseph smith lies plates not made of gold
7911331 do you really believe god had a son and that he sent him down and killed him to buy himself off
7911332 they had all things in common no rich and poor all made free partakers of heavenly gift
7911333 they did not walk after law of moses etc they walked after the new laws fast pray word of lord
7911334 scholars who write for byu studies fair or farms are not recognized in their own fields
7911335 as people come to be more educated they will leave the church
7911336 it is bad to be an apologist because they are not objective scholars
7911337 does the church know about you they would shut you down if they did
7911338 as you participate in this conversation and utilize the tools of new media remember who you are latter day saints
7911339 a soft answer turneth away wrath but grievous words stir up anger
7911340 old guy who doesnt even have a cell phone to call you from

7911343 i am excited to begin training for the upcoming season
7911344 weve got a solid group to start especially with the five transfers from ucf its unfortunate that four of the five will be sitting this year out due to not being granted the one time transfer exception but they will still play an important role providing leadership to our underclassmen in practice
7911345 our freshmen class is filled with some standout athletes including some rowers and some out of sport athletes who will be picking up an oar for the first time this fall
7911346 we are expecting a large number of walk ons to attend tryouts in september which will help us build a fast novice program that will feed our varsity program next year
7911347 meagan is one of the most tenacious individuals ive ever coached she is always the hardest working athlete in practice and is a great role model for her teammates
7911348 i transferred to ou because i wanted to be a part of the rich athletic tradition here i wanted to be a part of the building process in helping to turn ou rowing into a national caliber team later down the road the biggest reason i came to ou was to row for coach crain she is a great coach she gave me the opportunity to row for her two years ago and i just couldnt let that opportunity pass me now
7911349 sam was in and out of the top novice eight at ucf this past spring always challenging for a seat shes a fighter and as she continues to develop her skills she will make an impact
7911350 melea was a very strong leader on the novice squad at ucf i expect her to be one of the more vocal athletes on the team this year its good to have that kind of leadership especially as we start up a new program
7911351 amanda has the perfect balance of intellect and competitive drive that make her a force on the racecourse shes developing into a great coxswain and im really looking forward to working with her this year
7911352 ally has a tremendous amount of potential as a college rower shes got the size and athletic ability to become one of our fastest athletes this year
7911353 ali is a product of a great high school basketball program and is a gifted athlete
7911354 brittany is another out of sport athlete with great athletic ability
7911355 kileys experience from highland park crew will carry over into her role as a coxswain at ou her father played baseball at oklahoma so she was born a sooner
7911356 brooke was a successful high school swimmer and track and field athlete shes got the size at 511
7911357 izzy has only been rowing for a year but is familiar with oklahoma city rowing as she competed with the chesapeake juniors
7911358 bronwyn coxed for tulsa rowing club this past year and did a great job at the junior level were excited to have her join us this season
7911359 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
7911360 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
7911361 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
7911362 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7911363 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
7911364 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
7911365 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
7911366 no one works for someone we all just work together
7911367 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
7911368 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7911369 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7911370 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7911371 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7911372 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
7911373 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
7911374 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
7911375 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
7911376 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
7911377 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
7911378 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
7911379 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
7911380 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7911381 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7911382 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7911383 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7911384 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7911385 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7911386 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7911387 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7911388 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7911389 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7911390 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7911391 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7911392 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7911393 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7911394 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7911395 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7911396 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7911397 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7911398 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7911399 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7911400 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7911401 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7911402 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7911403 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7911404 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7911405 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7911406 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7911407 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7911408 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7911409 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7911410 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7911411 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7911412 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7911413 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7911414 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7911415 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7911416 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7911417 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7911418 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7911419 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7911420 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7911421 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7911422 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7911423 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7911424 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7911425 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7911426 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7911427 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7911428 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7911429 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7911430 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7911431 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7911432 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7911433 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7911434 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7911435 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7911436 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7911437 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7911438 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7911439 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7911440 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7911441 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7911442 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7911443 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7911444 how come nobody ever comes out here to do a signing
7911445 not a viable proposition to save and repair the existing building
7911446 como resultado de esto los datos relacionados con solicitudes de tarjetas de cr dito de algunos de nuestros clientes y datos de otros bancos
7911447 nos tomamos este asunto muy en serio y trabajamos con graphic data para resolver esta lamentable p rdida
7911448 estou muito feliz trata se de uma equipe qual nunca se pode dizer n o tenho condi es de atuar como titular e terei muito para aprender com nesta e paolo maldini
7911449 saber que o real madrid tem interesse em voc algo dif cil de assimilar a melhor equipe da espanha e quase imposs vel recusar estou em estado de choque
7911450 se o real madrid pagar minha multa seria maravilhoso para mim n o sei se o far o ou n o mas imagino que saberemos nos pr ximos dias
7911451 howard industries runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for jobs it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
7911452 its horrific what ice is doing to these families and these communities its just hard to imagine that this is the united states of america
7911453 were very disturbed at whats happened its a real contradiction between our proclaimed values of hard work and family in mississippi and the actions of local law enforcement and ice i think its a real affront to our values theyre creating their own terrorism by going after workers
7911454 we are more vulnerable now there is always fear of something like this but with these raids we know now its real
7911455 this is a sensitive time and we need to make sure we reach a solution one way or another
7911456 if he thought william was the best captain for the club then he is the man to call it
7911457 i am not really there a lot of people throw stones but i am not prepared to do that because i dont know the situation
7911458 he thinks he is the best captain for the club and i am not going to argue with his record
7911459 they need a bit of experience a couple of players
7911460 he believes in his squad and the talent he has got there i just think you need a couple more winners who have been there seen it and done it
7911461 for me they made a big error and the big mistake was not keeping on sol and ashley a little bit longer
7911462 i know they had the situation if you speak to arsene ashley wanted to go and whatever but i would have got them in my office and handcuffed them even though they werent performing
7911463 it was just for the transition all the kids come in and all the kids are there together everyone retired together the back four retired pretty much together patrick went dennis bergkamp all the people who knew the club inside out and knew how to be winners knew what to do
7911464 all the kids they are tremendously talented probably technically better than he has ever had it is the most technical squad he has ever had but they need to learn to become winners there is no one really who has made the transition
7911465 caution against characterizing either fair or farms by any one particular paper or small group of papers both groups are more in the nature of clearinghouses and involve contributions from literally hundreds of people
7911466 how various materials would be presented in portugal mongolia or a dozen places in africa if one desires church wide materials about dna and kirtland anti banking
7911467 such a view would essentially be very parochial if one has in mind the saints in malta or vanuatu or hong kong
7911468 id like to see something in the current curriculum like nibleys an approach to the book of mormon the 1957 melchizedek priesthood manual now republished by farms i also noted however that i can understand that as a world wide church the curriculum department has a tough balancing act in this area
7911469 not ready to disregard the boundaries that kept heaven and earth apart

7911605 i am extremely pleased with the strong financial results that the company continues to deliver for our shareholders the company has succeeded in substantially expanding its global manufacturing platform improved its financial flexibility and liquidity and is reporting today record revenues and earnings over the last twelve months the company has completed several strategically important acquisitions these have given the company a significant presence in the developing economies of the world access to important undersea power and communication technologies and exceptional management experience while we are proud of our roots in the united states today approximately 65 to 70 of our revenues are generated outside the country
7911606 we have also seen strong recovery in our lan cable products with new product designs and strong business leadership i am also pleased to see significant progress at our silec facility with respect to product throughput as well as their lean manufacturing skills the integrations of ecn and nsw have been absolutely seamless and performance ahead of our investment case
7911607 demand for these products remains high and capacity tight in the market the company has accelerated its investment plans in these high growth areas of the market and expects solid returns over the next several years from these actions recently the company was awarded its first submarine wind farm project which is the first to be located in the north sea we are also working on a significant long haul submarine fiber optic communication link which is currently in sea trials
7911608 with the addition of pdic and its outstanding platform of assets and management the company is pushing deeper into developing economies as well as introducing general cable to areas of the world where the company has not historically participated in a meaningful way for instance in the gulf region the company was recently awarded certain energy cable contracts that will more than double our presence in the region over the next year
7911609 the company continues to benefit from its strategic investments in new products and geographies more than offsetting the ongoing weakness in certain product lines in the developed economies for the first quarter the company expects to report earnings per share of 1 05 or more compared to an adjusted earnings per share of 1 01 in the first quarter of 2007 on revenues of approximately 1 5 billion

7911733 people from the community were asking me why i was not breastfeeding
7911734 i am so happy that after using pmtct i now have an hiv negative baby and am settled in my marriage
7911735 my husband and i decided to enrol in the pmtct programme and adhere to art antiretroviral treatment that is why we were able to get an hiv negative baby
7911736 i named my baby after alex coutinho the former director of taso
7911737 i decided not to breastfeed even though i knew about exclusive breastfeeding recommended for hiv positive mothers who cannot afford breast milk substitutes
7911738 our first baby is hiv positive and when i got the news it was not easy i just broke down
7911739 since she started taking arvs in 2006 it has been tough
7911740 the biggest problem is i cannot tell her what she is suffering from because she cannot understand she is only four years old

7911759 the biggest challenge facing the lds church is not distinguishing their present from the fundamentalist present but getting people to understand the difference between their past and the current practice of the fundamentalist groups this initiative i believe is their first attempt to do that
7911760 i have to say ive been a lifetime student and writer of mormon legal history at least i learned many many things in her book that i didnt know she captured it very very well and was able to stress also what remained unimpaired by the compromise other books have been published but not in a way that would grab the awareness of the average mormon
7911761 removed all information about plural marriage from all its manuals
7911762 i have constantly said no man shall have but one wife at a time unless the lord directs otherwise
7911763 inasmuch as this church of christ has been reproached with the crime of fornication and polygamy we declare that we believe that one man should have one wife and one woman but one husband except in case of death when either is at liberty to marry again
7911764 i bear record before god angels and men that joseph smith received that revelation and i bear record that emma smith gave her husband in marriage to several women while he was living some of whom are to day living in this city and some may be present in this congregation and who if called upon would confirm my words
7911765 all objections whether they be on abortion plural marriage seventh day worship etc basically hinge on whether joseph smith and his successors were and are prophets of god receiving divine revelation
7911766 god has commanded that the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and woman lawfully wedded as husband and wife
7911767 a surprising number had not known about joseph smiths plural wives

7911773 polygamy prophets and prevarication frequently and rarely asked questions about the initiation practice and cessation of plural marriage in the church of jesus christ of latter day saints
7911774 polygamy a limited practice in the early pioneer days of the church was discontinued in 1890 some 117 years ago
7911775 if any man understood the proper meaning of polygamy and lived it correctly it was mads christian jensen
7911776 a question that they had wanted to ask a church historian for some time
7911777 celestial marriage that is marriage for time and eternity and polygamous or plural marriage are not synonomous terms monogamous marriages for time and eternity solemnized in our temples in accordance with the word of the lord and the laws of the church are celestial marriages
7911778 but mccain keeps churning the ads out anyway including one featuring a disillusioned clinton delegate from wisconsin who says shes now voting republican for the first time
7911779 i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment
7911780 a lot of democrats will vote mccain its okay really
7911781 the thing is they got guys that are willing to make a three year commitment which i think is tremendous
7911782 we had guys that committed for 2004 and then all of a sudden 9 11 happened and then there were injuries
7911783 when i was old enough to help i spent every day in the rice fields with my mother while we worked she taught me everything i had to know about life in the west for example people believe they must pursue happiness as if it were some kind of flighty bird that is always out of reach in the east we believe we are born with happiness and one of lifes important tasks my mother told me is to protect it it seemed strange to me then when the catholic teachers told us that little babies were born in sin and must spend their lives struggling miserably to overcome it how can one be happier than a little baby they come into the world with nothing and could not be more pleased about it

7911786 it reminds me of what we used to do as kids
7911787 wed lay there on the ground and look up in the sky at the clouds and we would make all kinds of imaginary things out of the clouds i think theyre making up what they hope would be true or would want to be true or at least want to lead people to believe is true so they could get them to back a democratic candidate
7911788 he opposed while in the illinois senate the born alive infant protection act which really is about infanticide
7911789 he did not want to protect babies who survived an abortion he did not want to provide basic medical care he wanted to kill them outside the womb allow them to die

7911806 this is a clear indication that people of all races have rejected the communal politics of barisan nasional it is a clear endorsement of our reform agenda we are on track to take over the government
7911807 i thank the voters the wisdom of the people has prevailed the win shows the people reject the sodomy allegations thrown at my husband
7911808 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year
7911809 however overall readings are still quite low by historical standards and it is still too early to tell if the worst is behind us
7911810 i am grateful for the opportunity the federation president gave me to direct the team at the olympics but i want to train throughout the season not just for two months a year
7911811 it is important to reach an olympic final and to have played the way we did against the united states is something we can feel proud of
7911812 i dont think at least for me that it will make any difference we know the money is really important but now we are so close to the end of the transfer window it wont make a massive difference
7911813 so the key for me will be to do the right things in the game and have enough confidence so that we arent talking about if we have money or not
7911814 the team wasnt good enough around them but i think both players were linking well and the understanding is improving
7911815 we know we have enough quality and good players to win this game
7911816 ive seen a lot of areas we need to improve in over the last three games we have been analysing the games and the reasons why and we need to get back to our form in the pre season games when we were scoring lots of goals
7911817 this is not an easy choice but it is the only way to save the lives of people
7911818 unfortunately they were ignored also by nato and the un
7911819 this contradicts the principle of territorial integrity a principle based on the international law of nations and for this reason it is unacceptable
7911820 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
7911821 we consider that this is a regrettable decision and we reiterate our commitment to the territorial integrity of georgia
7911822 were bewildered at the extreme level of activity of nato naval forces in the black sea which continue to increase their numbers
7911823 only yesterday i said there were nine nato ships in the sea and by evening another frigate of the us navy passed through the bosphorus straits
7911824 we have also learnt that another eight warships from nato states are expected shortly
7911825 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7911826 this is a great day in the history of our country and our people
7911827 this decision has no legal force russia will face harsh political consequences from this
7911828 i think its no secret and ive said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think the settlement activity is helpful to the process
7911829 what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7911830 i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together over this period of time
7911831 so we will continue to press ahead to get agreement so that we know what is in israel and what is in palestine that is ultimately the goal
7911832 initiated 433 new housing units during the period of january to may 2008 compared to just 240 units during the period january to may 2007
7911833 which still continue and which without a doubt are the main obstacle in the political process
7911834 just because we have not yet succeeded does not mean we have failed
7911835 will continue efforts to reach a historic agreement by the end of the bush administration
7911836 i would like to suggest to my partners not to use it as an excuse and i know they are not using it as an excuse but i understand their frustration sometimes
7911837 there were some small activities but they will not influence the ability to negotiate nor the future borders of the palestinian state
7911838 o ne of the best most moving intimate rousing humble and beautiful speeches ive heard from a convention platform
7911839 on the verge of tears the whole time yet still pretty genuine
7911840 got the sense there was so much more she could have said
7911841 due to their race his unusual pedigree and her comment about having not been proud of america and the trashing she has received on right wing talk radio
7911842 came over as strong and assured yet approachable and not at all threatening or angry those last two were the notes of course that the campaign was most anxious to avoid
7911843 was to rehabilitate herself to take the edge of anger and resentment from her public pronouncements and embrace a wholesome country loving american dream living image
7911844 the impression of being a little realer than the seasoned pols
7911845 t hose who watched now know she is a mother and a wife she also showed how alive her husbands message is in her own heart
7911846 more passionate about her husbands message than he sometimes is
7911847 a nice speech well delivered and not so over the top with her love of country refrains that it felt forced
7911848 was as pitch perfect as she can be in presenting her story but if theres one critique of her speech is that it was more about her than barack but maybe that was the point
7911849 came across as likeable approachable and someone whose experience was not very different from millions of middle class americans
7911850 there is no question that as a healthy educated 41 year old she is capable of earning her own income
7911851 you never know whats going to be effective you have to do what you can one of the things that we can do is stand out here and let them know that a celebration of the naqba is not going to go unchallenged
7911852 people dont realize that the biggest money in the entire world budget for foreign aid goes to israel
7911853 and most of it goes to arms its being done in our name the exploitation of the palestinians is the same as the exploitation of the people in the community i live in in detroit

7911860 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen

7911878 most sane people choose their political party based on issues things they feel things they think interests they have and it may be leaders they like but they dont just start with the party tag it isnt because they are in love with this person its that they are in love with a certain notion of america
7911879 but the question becomes how long will the hearing proceed the hearing could actually go on for a number of days and i think that really is the issue so really i hesitate to crystal ball or speculate on this i mean there have been so many twists and turns in this saga that ive given up trying to predict i think im just going to let the universe unfold and just be ready for whatever happens when its finally unwrapped

7911908 as the worlds population grows so will demand for food and energy
7911909 using non food feedstocks for feed and energy is one way that agriculture can apply innovation to create renewable sustainable solutions
7911910 this is not a debate about abortion this is about the baby bonus being misused and misapplied to women who do have terminations
7911911 clearly that is not the intention its not in keeping with the support of mainstream australians for the baby bonus
7911912 i think it is a very humane gesture from society to say you are going through enough already were not going to withhold the bonus
7911913 if there is any evidence of this occurring we will follow it up immediately
7911914 decided to compromise by giving hyatt a chance to fulfill their commitments by managing this serving of alcohol in a secluded restaurant on the 40th floor so he would keep his hotel with the family atmosphere he would like to present to his guests
7911915 wouldnt give you the impact on the alcohol ban that much as if you were in the winter season which features businesspeople and international tourists
7911916 this is the fastest temperature change in the instrumental record and it puts us back to where we were in 1930
7911917 if the temperature does not soon recover we will have to conclude that global warming is over
7911918 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7911919 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7911920 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7911921 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7911922 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7911923 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7911924 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7911925 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7911926 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7911927 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7911928 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7911929 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7911930 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7911931 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7911932 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7911933 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
7911934 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7911935 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7911936 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
7911937 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
7911938 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
7911939 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
7911940 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
7911941 black yellow brown take your pick men are not allowed to be ordained

7911945 through our partnership with laserfiche we have been able to extend our market reach by providing end to end solutions that offer rich e forms on the front end complemented by rios document management backend
7911946 rio provides a complete document management solution for the enterprise from a single vendor and it is very important for our customers to be able to easily add to their solution to meet their specific business needs
7911947 we are very pleased that cerenades industry leading e forms solution is fully compatible with our new system
7911948 viewers were disgusted that a mother of two young girls would use such foul language
7911949 the president is on the cusp of conserving more ocean territory than any leader has ever done thats an amazing legacy to leave the nation
7911950 presidents focus on ocean protection first with papahanaumokuakea marine national monument in hawaii and now with these proposed monuments is the kind of leadership we need now and from future presidents to ensure our world beneath the waves is protected explored studied and cherished
7911951 a picture perfect healthy coral ecosystem that contained more fish than any other coral reef ecosystem in the world
7911952 the worlds greatest proportion of top predators including sharks a key indicator of ecosystem health
7911953 there are very few places on earth like the central pacific islands
7911954 it is a place that time forgot spectacular wildlife stunning beauty and almost no people or even human activity a monument designation will celebrate and protect this extraordinary place
7911955 could harm the seabirds turtles and other wildlife that lives in these areas
7911956 we have only just received the news so we are not in a position to comment around any of the detail
7911957 i wasted one day on this already i dont want to waste any more i will read the release and go from there
7911958 you enter you do your best you hope with the best and you have to live with whats delivered
7911959 a review of extensive video coverage showed elsom in fact using two hands to pull down matfield rotating him sideways and off balance
7911960 he landed on his feet and fell awkwardly across elsom
7911961 obviously it does affect the mix it is your mix on the bench as well yeah theres a bit to think about
7911962 every week there are players who are injured and unavailable to us but there are a queue of blokes who are waiting for their opportunity as well it will be what it is we dont know what is in the future but were working hard to make sure our next experience is a good one whoever pulls on the jersey
7911963 the commitment by the premier to deliver extra financial incentives for new renewable base load projects such as wave and geothermal will encourage private investment in renewable energy in western australia
7911964 promoting distributed generation through the south west will deliver renewable energy from wave and geothermal sources and provide dispatchable base load and improve energy security across the south west electricity grid
7911965 delivering an incentive for renewable energy projects in western australia will encourage projects arising from the national mandated renewable energy target mret to establish in wa ensuring western australias industry base is also diversified
7911966 at a time when all industry sectors are competing for resources and stretched with finding people in a booming economy providing incentives to develop much needed renewable energy will allow project proponents to have the confidence to invest in people
7911967 todays announcements can be a part of a combination of measures that deliver joined up outcomes and will help develop a more sustainable economy for all western australians wa sea looks forward to further election commitments on sustainable energy measures that bolster energy efficiency and improve outcomes for the economy support for government agencies and tax relief for business and the community that improves access to energy efficient homes buildings appliances and vehicles
7911968 wa sea supports all initiatives that significantly ramp up use of western australias massive renewable energy resources resources that will continue to shine on us to wash up on our shores and to blow past us without limit and with no inflation in its price
7911969 spouse and the humming field are also on the bill
7911970 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7911971 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7911972 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7911973 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7911974 where i would probably live if i didnt live in new york
7911975 in spite of the harmonious celebration at this convention going through a severe economic turndown downturn
7911976 there are thousands of companies out of business and going out of business
7911977 state budgets wildly out of balance more people going without food and shelter than at any time in the last three decades entire regions in this country are struggling for survival children going hungry people put out of work their jobs are driven overseas rather than living at peace with ourselves as we were promised eight years ago we are more divided than ever
7911978 why is that because the vice president lives there is that any way to run a government i dont think so
7911979 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7911980 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7911981 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7911982 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7911983 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7911984 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7911985 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7911986 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7911987 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7911988 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7911989 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7911990 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7911991 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7911992 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7911993 offered so much room and so few restrictions allowing your creative skills to come into play
7911994 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7911995 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7911996 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7911997 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7911998 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7911999 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7912000 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7912001 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7912002 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7912003 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7912004 i was wondering if maybe solar cells could be made with carbon nanotubes
7912005 i mean carbon is cheap and ive seen self assembling molecules so i think it would be easy to make
7912006 we said al gores just a spokesman for these ideas wouldnt you like to meet with the people doing the real work
7912007 todays visit to the lab is only one of seven visits david will be making to companies doing work in this area
7912008 weve had kids who wanted to swim with the dolphins or paint their room in a tom and jerry theme but davids wish is really unique
7912009 a friend and i are trying to build a hydrocraft using ions
7912010 but we havent been able to get the aluminum foil and balsa wood into the air yet
7912011 grow algae and use carbon dioxide to make oxygen and it could feed on the astronauts waste
7912012 another problem well have with sending an astronaut to mars is their exposure to radiation thats something else you might think about
7912013 these are really excellent ideas and we want to do everything we can to encourage his inventiveness after all this is where the wild new things come from
7912014 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
7912015 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
7912016 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
7912017 are a bad reflection on him as a human being
7912018 okay so see that paint color behind the murderer there do you think it would look good with stainless steel appliances
7912019 i know and its not just a fridge youre buying you also have to love that brand dishwasher and oven too so they all match
7912020 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
7912021 when ted kennedy comes here to ask us all to pull together as a party not many people in this hall are not going to take that next step
7912022 it never stopped him he didnt go in a corner and weep he just started something else and now here he is tonight so tenacious
7912023 anyone whos advanced for him knows he likes a stool
7912024 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
7912025 i have a headache from the altitude today i cant imagine what its like for someone whos got radiation chemotherapy and has to take a battery of drugs
7912026 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7912027 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7912028 id heard it from a pretty good source last night but everyone was thrilled to hear about it at our breakfast this is the kind of moment that sen kennedy lives for
7912029 id heard something over the weekend but his health is such an issue it wasnt clear if hed be able to come
7912030 im a cancer survivor and i know how draining this kind of thing can be
7912031 it pushes the focus back on the challenge ahead and on obama and the race it gives people something positive to talk about
7912032 this may be ted kennedys final gift to the party
7912033 this says that he feels this is the democrats year and the party is not as unified as hed like it to be his appearance takes the headlines away from the clinton faction
7912034 happens to be somebody who i love to death hes just a good man and obviously hes going through a difficult time but im glad that we can use this convention to remind people of the contributions hes made to this country
7912035 just charges the atmosphere here the emotion is enormous its just what you want to start off the convention
7912036 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
7912037 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
7912038 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
7912039 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
7912040 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
7912041 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
7912042 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
7912043 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7912044 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7912045 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7912046 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7912047 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7912048 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7912049 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7912050 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7912051 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7912052 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7912053 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7912054 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7912055 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7912056 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7912057 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7912058 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7912059 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7912060 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7912061 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7912062 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7912063 madonna shows that obama has no chance against mccains gang
7912064 if its boring to do something once do it twice if it is still boring do it 4 times if still boring do it 8 times
7912065 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7912066 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7912067 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7912068 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7912069 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7912070 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7912071 while the two patients who developed pml were on monotherapy taking the drug by itself without other medicines the fda still believes that tysabri monotherapy may confer a lower risk of pml than when tysabri is used together with other immunomodulatory medicines

7912078 this new version adds tremendous workflow functionality that puts the author in total control of their document production workflow process this is particularly beneficial for international firms and firms with offices spread across multiple time zones
7912079 consider this scenario a lawyer in london submits a dictation to the local typist pool for transcription at 5 00 p m gmt the support office closes for the evening and the job has yet to be transcribed a workflow rule can be established to automatically route that unfinished job to the firms chicago transcription queue where it is only 11 00 a m cst and six hours of work time remains for members of the queue in the event that the work remains incomplete at the close of the work day in chicago the job is automatically routed back to the london queue for attention the next morning

7912083 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7912084 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7912085 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7912086 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7912087 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7912088 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7912089 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7912090 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7912091 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7912092 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7912093 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7912094 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7912095 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7912096 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7912097 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7912098 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7912099 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7912100 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7912101 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7912102 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7912103 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7912104 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7912105 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7912106 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

7912109 many of my friends in the legal fraternity have never been comfortable dealing with their own marketing they either offload their marketing campaigns to high cost agencies or refrain from it altogether
7912110 internet marketing is the smartest way to market today its so important to befriend it
7912111 there are zillions of articles on internet marketing but for a legal professional the guidance to apply it is hard to find most of our competitors offer products that are suitable for the marketing professionals our club is meant for the business manager of a law firm who has his own challenges and no time to get into technical details of either marketing or internet

7912117 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
7912118 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
7912119 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
7912120 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
7912121 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
7912122 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
7912123 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
7912124 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
7912125 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
7912126 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
7912127 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
7912128 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
7912129 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
7912130 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
7912131 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
7912132 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
7912133 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
7912134 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
7912135 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance
7912136 it could be good for the nation if other corporate companies could emulate what standard bank has done to work with undp on an issue that is of national and global concern
7912137 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
7912138 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
7912139 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
7912140 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
7912141 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
7912142 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
7912143 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
7912144 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
7912145 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
7912146 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
7912147 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
7912148 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
7912149 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7912150 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7912151 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7912152 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7912153 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7912154 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7912155 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7912156 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
7912157 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7912158 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7912159 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7912160 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7912161 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7912162 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7912163 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7912164 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7912165 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7912166 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7912167 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7912168 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7912169 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7912170 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7912171 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7912172 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7912173 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7912174 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7912175 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7912176 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7912177 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7912178 who are open to doing something on the production side
7912179 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7912180 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7912181 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7912182 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7912183 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7912184 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7912185 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7912186 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7912187 the use of active rfid technology has barely cracked the surface for it asset business processes
7912188 through this alliance with rf code we will use our expertise to help rf code customers and partners realize the additional value from their investment in the technology by expanding usage into service management and best practices for it asset management
7912189 we are successfully changing expectations for traditional asset tracking processes
7912190 accurate and up to the minute visibility into physical it asset inventory has wide applicability within any organization working closely with animus solutions will help accelerate the return our customers receive from deploying our active rfid technology
7912191 we are very pleased to expand our partnership with quaero

7912200 i can assure you we take all precautions and all rules of engagement are followed
7912201 we have tremendous confidence and faith in our leadership here in afghanistan
7912202 we are not helping the taliban nor were they in the village
7912203 we dont know why the coalition forces raided our village with blind eyes this does not make sense
7912204 we continue to have regular and rigorous contact on all elements of the mission whether it be military whether it be civil or whether it be diplomatic government to government relationships
7912205 we take all necessary precautions and we make all efforts to see that level of co operation protects civilians and furthers the goals of the mission
7912206 it is against the targets and objectives which we both the international community and the afghans have picked out
7912207 there is a need to exercise more caution we see what we can further improve by using much more of our intelligence doing a better analysis integrating our planning and bringing operational communications much closer together which will take care and prevent the repetition of such incidents
7912208 we did discuss as i did with former governor mr wardak efforts to bring more afghans into the national police and the army
7912209 i know that minister wardak has made this a great priority

7912229 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
7912230 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7912231 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7912232 in the process of expanding in europe germany is one of several possible future markets
7912233 we receive inquiries from all over the world there is enormous interest in current
7912234 according to our observations germany is a market that could soon be ripe for current
7912235 tv and the web amount to the same thing to us
7912236 unlike most broadcasters we do not only use television to attract people to the internet on the contrary people go to current com swap thoughts concerns and videos and then we bring the best of it to the tv screen
7912237 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group

7912241 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7912242 police broke up the two groups and brought the situation under control
7912243 a mob tried to torch a school bus but police chased them away
7912244 it expresses its solidarity with local churches and the religious orders involved and condemns these actions which are an affront to dignity peoples freedom and endanger peaceful civil coexistence
7912245 people are totally harassed driven away from their homes beaten up and institutions destroyed
7912246 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7912247 more effort should be put in order to further reduce
7912248 more cooperation in improving the humanitarian situation especially as the holy month of ramadan approaches an important event for muslims
7912249 three helicopters are already air dropping food materials but it will not make much difference more and more air force helicopters should be pressed into crisis management and more boats to rescue those who are trapped and taken to safe area if we rely on the state government assistance we will be responsible for the death of thousands more to be killed in this flood
7912250 we met the district magistrate who said that boats will be brought into service but no help came the local legislator has provided some boats and we are traveling by these
7912251 the army is committed to ensuring that no disruptions are caused to vehicular movement between jammu and valley regions of jammu and kashmir
7912252 normal vehicular traffic has continued on the srinagar jammu road for the past over three weeks even yesterday when call for bandh and chakka jam was issued in jammu and call for defying curfew orders were given by the separatists in the valley over 1 000 civilian vehicles moved unhindered and unharmed between srinagar and jammu
7912253 georgian president mikheil saakashvili chose genocide to solve his political tasks
7912254 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have more than once spoken in referenda supporting the independence of their republics we understand that after what had happened they have the right to decide their fate themselves
7912255 chosen a policy of confrontation not only with the rest of europe but also with the international community in general
7912256 nothing scares us including the prospect of a cold war but we dont want it
7912257 in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
7912258 we feel happy we all have tears in our eyes we feel pride for our people
7912259 the recognition of these two entities is clearly a step in the wrong direction from the stock markets point of view
7912260 the current atmosphere reminds me of the situation in europe in 1914 when because of one terrorist leading world powers clashed
7912261 if they nato start smashing the dinnerware then we can add more to the list

7912267 para el liverpool la liga de campeones es una competici n important sima y ser a un desastre no lograr clasificarse
7912268 somos conscientes de que este partido a n no est decidido
7912269 la decisi n que ha tomado el club seguro que va a ser para dar un pasito m s de cara a que los canteranos est n bien amarrados

7912286 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
7912287 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
7912288 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
7912289 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7912290 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7912291 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
7912292 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
7912293 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
7912294 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
7912295 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
7912296 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7912297 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7912298 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
7912299 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
7912300 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
7912301 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
7912302 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
7912303 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
7912304 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7912305 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7912306 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7912307 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7912308 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7912309 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7912310 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
7912311 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste

7912315 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way

7912341 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
7912342 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
7912343 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
7912344 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
7912345 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
7912346 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
7912347 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
7912348 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
7912349 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
7912350 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
7912351 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
7912352 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7912353 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7912354 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women

7912359 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7912360 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7912361 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7912362 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7912363 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7912364 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7912365 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7912366 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7912367 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7912368 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7912369 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7912370 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7912371 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7912372 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7912373 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7912374 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too

7912431 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
7912432 people dont know yet that john mccain is just bad for women
7912433 talking about these differences is clearly a pathway to generating intensity among women voters
7912434 these swing women voters have tremendous economic anxiety right now

7912453 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants

7912460 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7912461 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7912462 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7912463 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously

7912472 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7912473 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7912474 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7912475 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7912476 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7912477 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices

7912482 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7912483 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7912484 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7912485 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7912486 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7912487 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7912488 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7912489 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late

7912491 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years

7912494 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7912495 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7912496 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7912497 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government

7912501 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7912502 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7912503 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7912504 what does he want me to do just be a rainbow
7912505 seems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for 200 million to iran
7912506 the thing i would worry about is that it would almost look like a publicity stunt
7912507 investigations are still ongoing to find out how this equipment was removed from one of graphic datas secure locations we take customer privacy and data security very seriously this incident is extremely regrettable and were taking every possible step to retrieve the data and ensure this is an isolated incident

7912516 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7912517 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7912518 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7912519 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7912520 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7912521 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7912522 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7912523 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7912524 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7912525 just remember fans take losses much harder than the majority of players do
7912526 ticket prices are reasonable but the royals just cant shake over a decades worth of the doldrums
7912527 i thought this was nice at one point during the olympic ceremony tonight they had 56 children march in all belonging to john edwards
7912528 while after vigorously denying reports of his extramarital affair and calling the story ridiculous untrue and tabloid trash john edwards today admitted he had an affair and the national enquirer was the only publication writing about it the national enquirer was the first to break it turns out it was true you know what this means elvis is alive bigfoot is real aliens are here its all true
7912529 i guess edwards apparently met this woman at a new york city bar in 2006 and he is a pretty smooth operator
7912530 no he actually said today about the other woman he doesnt love her oh thats smart now youve got two women mad at you great way to go
7912531 you know what it turns out she was his campaign videographer yeah there you go think therell be a sex tape coming soon huh
7912532 well democrats are furious theyre going on record now saying john edwards will not be allowed to speak at the convention because of this affair yeah instead speaking in his place bill clinton you have to put your foot down

7912536 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

7912599 i thought hed be cleared up and ready to go with no questions there are still questions and some concerns weve got some time to see how it is during the week i was anticipating that it wouldnt be an issue but its still an issue

7912608 im confident that with an obama presidency we will have comprehensive immigration reform in the first term but its not going to be easy
7912609 an important part of the answer is not to have so many people who do not have legal status
7912610 whole detention system that is wrong and causing lots of suffering
7912611 although desirable i think it would be difficult to include fixing the detention and immigration judicial system in comprehensive immigration reform because it really wasnt a critical part of what came about last time
7912612 it doesnt mean that it shouldnt get done im just not sure if thats the best vehicle for it if the goal is to include these issues in comprehensive immigration reform then we have lots of work to do to make them front and center in this debate
7912613 we knew the senate mccain kenney bill was deeply flawed but we believed the legalization component for the 12 million immigrants was decent and the family reunification provisions could be fixed before the final passage
7912614 doesnt fear the rule of law he said other advocates shy

7912639 maybe we should have had a discussion before policy is sic put out there publicly mr adams said
7912640 a lot of points and concern about the policy during the meeting
7912641 the basis is right its how you get there and there are some people who have great difficultly in organising a 12 year old to get to school when they dont want to go to school he said
7912642 a lot of us are uncomfortable about this policy but it was a rudd labor commitment and kevin rudd confirmed that yesterday that its a promise he will be keeping she told abc radio today
7912643 i think its fair to say there is a great deal of concern within the caucus
7912644 its a pretty extreme organisation thats got extreme powers that doesnt confront anybody else in australian society he said
7912645 i dont think we need to keep this at the extreme end of where it is at the moment i think we should be able to wind that back somewhat before 2010
7912646 a federal government committed to workplace rights has no justification for keeping the abcc until 2010 greens senator rachel siewert said

7912738 but broadly i think that divorce stats will continue to go down unless the law changes to give co habitants more rights or courts start enforcing pre nuptial agreements properly because marriage relative to co habitation is simply an unattractive option
7912739 some divorcees are appealing to get awards reduced or indeed capitalised to take account of settlement payouts where they dont think the money is going to be forthcoming in the future
7912740 you might have the husband going back to get his maintenance reduced but at the same time the wife is saying i dont have any confidence this maintenance is going to be payable in the future i want it capitalised or rolled up into a lump sum and i want to have his settlement payout to achieve that

7912763 that proves the mayor did not misuse public funds for personal gain
7912764 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7912765 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7912766 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7912767 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7912768 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7912769 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7912770 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7912771 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7912772 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7912773 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7912774 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7912775 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

7912786 it doesnt seem like the crowd is on the edge of their seats
7912787 but i cant help but feel after the first night of the convention that it was largely a wasted night
7912788 they did a poor job explaining what the choices are
7912789 they are trying to race across the viability threshold before the republicans can say that this man is not ready to be president

7912795 honoring them like this seems to be the right thing to do
7912796 i dont know anyone whos passed this is my way of honoring the fallen and saying thank you you dont have to know someone specifically to know the sacrifice that was given
7912797 we love to run what better way to honor those who have fallen than by doing something that we love to do
7912798 we run across america to raise awareness about the lives of those who fought to activate their memories and keep their spirits alive to support organizations that help wounded veterans and the families of those killed and to aid in the healing process for those americans whose lives have been affected by the war

7912807 this is a huge day for our state today we officially announce that louisiana will be home to the first nuclear module manufacturing facility in the u s shaw will retain their headquarters in baton rouge for at least 15 years and shaw and westinghouse together will generate 2 900 new jobs in our state this is a truly historic announcement for the people of louisiana and our entire nation as we continue to face rising energy prices and search for ways to decrease our nations reliance on foreign sources of oil we know that we have to invest more in alternative domestic energy sources like wind ethanol solar and nuclear energy this announcement does not only represent new jobs and a new vibrant economic engine in our state but also shows that louisiana is harnessing the future of the energy industry and the most innovative thinking of the next generation
7912808 i want to thank governor bobby jindal and secretary stephen moret as well his economic development staff and the many officials in lake charles who worked so diligently to site the new module fabrication and assembly facility at the port of lake charles
7912809 additionally the shaw group is glad to formalize the 15 year commitment to baton rouge and the state of louisiana because both decisions announced today strengthen an already strong relationship with our home state
7912810 the agreement to fabricate modules for the ap1000 tm nuclear power plant in louisiana again proves that the nuclear renaissance is now a reality
7912811 westinghouse and our consortium partner the shaw group are providing four new plants in china and we have been identified for no less than 14 plants here in the united states other markets are fast emerging it is imperative therefore that we move decisively to develop the infrastructure to meet the needs of our fast growing and essential industry we thank all of our partners and the state of louisiana for the hard work and commitment that makes todays announcement a reality we look forward to a long and mutually beneficial relationship
7912812 we are extremely excited about the announcement of shaw and westinghouse locating a new module fabrication and assembly facility in lake charles
7912813 this is a major project for our state and our local community it will not only bring new jobs it will help to diversify and strengthen our local economy
7912814 the shaw group has been a tremendous asset to the baton rouge community as a major employer a contributor to our local economy and a generous benefactor to local efforts that improve the quality of life for everyone
7912815 from their headquarters here they touch every corner of the world but most of all they touch the lives of the citizens of east baton rouge parish in many ways i am extremely pleased that the shaw headquarters will remain here in baton rouge keeping our city on the map as the primary location of this international corporation
7912816 due to a recent streamlining of the federal permitting process for nuclear reactors increasing costs for traditional energy sources and likely greenhouse gas legislation at the federal level the nuclear industry is poised for a renaissance in the united states todays announcement begins to position louisiana as a major player in the nuclear energy sector at an exciting juncture in the industrys development

7912820 i was shocked at the anger toward me i think part of its reserved for women you stepped out of the role of the good girl
7912821 i drive with the tractor to yata to bring water if the soldiers are nice they let me pass if not i have to travel three hours in the fields on a route that bypasses the checkpoint it all depends on the type of soldier at the checkpoint
7912822 we were born in caves and were used to a hard life we have no problem we became used to it already from our parents and i also force my children to become accustomed to our hard life only the settlers disrupt our lives they are destroying our lives we grew up with this we liked this situation we like to be with nature in difficult conditions except for the settlers who have inhabited our lands they have disrupted things all we want is to continue our lives thats all and we hope that the settlers will stop causing us problems theyre interrupting our lives
7912823 when i come to the police station they see me and close the gate i waste my entire day there if i go to file a complaint i need to spend an entire day in the sun thats what happened the last time i stood there tossed outside like a dog i push the buttons speak on the intercom they tell me ill be admitted right away and nothing happens
7912824 i had arrived there at 10 a m and it took me until 5 30 p m before i could file the complaint even when i had already done so i felt that the policemen were not receiving me properly and the investigator was not writing down what i said
7912825 they began to shoot those paint bombs at our children and our children got scared and fled
7912826 i wanted to approach to ask them why are you stealing our sheep but they are very fanatic people and they told me to leave the place immediately i didnt see bilal or the sheep where was bilal where were the sheep i was afraid i phoned the emergency number 100 they didnt answer it started to get dark were in the dark alone theyre cursing and shouting and im worried about my son and the sheep
7912827 i got the children used to not being afraid and i hope that it wont happen again i dont want to say that all of beit yatir is like that not everyone in the settlement is a thief and wicked its important to say that only a few and especially the one in the picture in recent months its become worse and theyve started to make a lot of trouble for us i feel it they try to steal sheep they try to run over sheep they throw stones at night and scare my children
7912828 every time it revolves boom its like an explosion at night
7912829 the goal of this language is to not exclude anwr
7912830 if there are violent demonstrations these national guard soldiers will have to protect people and businesses from protests that could get out of hand
7912831 in our space mission we couldnt get a satellite on short notice to eye a demonstration and give us real time images
7912832 but we could provide imagery of the area that we have in our existing databases computer applications allow the space soldiers to access the existing imagery and create three dimensional views
7912833 we could provide flight routes so the pilot would know what buildings hed have to maneuver around
7912834 our soldiers in the turtle suits protective gear will have a very different mission from those performing the space operations role
7912835 its very much as it is in iraq we could have a team at central command headquarters in florida and a team in iraq to support soldiers who have very different needs
7912836 women have a lot to offer and if they do well at their job theyll succeed
7912837 it wasnt that long ago when women didnt even have the right to vote and now we have women who are general officers in the army i remember when i thought seeing a female lieutenant colonel was a big deal
7912838 i think the suffrage movement effectively changed the way americans look at the role of women in society and has continued to be a pathway for us to have more opportunities
7912839 are we alone to ask and take the utmost that our women can give service and sacrifice of every kind and still say we do not see what title that gives them to stand by our sides in the guidance of the affairs of their nations and ours
7912840 we have made partners of the women in this war shall we admit them only to a partnership of suffering and sacrifice and toil and not to a partnership of privilege and right
7912841 the right of citizens of the united states to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on the account of sex
7912842 the army teaches values and if you practice those values you develop strength
7912843 the woman suffrage movement has made it possible for us to utilize that strength and continue to do better in our careers as well as our lives
7912844 when i talk to my nursing classmates from college nothing theyve done can compare with the experiences ive had
7912845 the army was definitely an excellent career choice for me
7912846 i became an army nurse for a reason i actually like taking care of soldiers
7912847 a traditional company is focused on the wartime mission and training requirements in this company we are focused on the physical spiritual and mental health of soldiers on the overall well being of soldiers
7912848 we want to return them to an optimum stage of health and prepare them for the next stage in their life whether that is serving or transitioning out
7912849 we want to make sure they are a better soldier when they leave here its very satisfying to see a soldier first come to us and then see them make improvements to where they can finally say goodbye to us we want them to have productive lives
7912850 my father was in the army and my oldest brother was in the army also
7912851 when it was time to go to college i applied for an rotc scholarship i figured i could give four years
7912852 but four years came and went and i was still having fun and enjoying myself so i stayed
7912853 we saw a lot of gunshot wounds and ied injuries
7912854 we had over 396 trauma cases while i was there
7912855 it was humbling to see the level of health care that didnt exist in that country afghanistan is truly a third world country
7912856 we were attached to the 10th mountain division its units were very good about getting out and establishing relationships with the local communities patients from the local area would come to us or soldiers would be out in the communities and they would find children who needed care and they would bring them to us we treated people from afghanistan and pakistan in our american hospital
7912857 it was emotionally draining when there was the death of a child
7912858 there was a period of time when we lost five children in 10 days that was very difficult on the staff but our command was very good at bringing in behavioral counselors and chaplains to talk to any of us who were having difficulties dealing with things
7912859 we looked after each other they were the finest enlisted soldiers and ncos ive ever worked with
7912860 we still keep in touch id go back in a heartbeat to work with them again
7912861 they know mommy is a nurse and takes care of people who really need to be taken care of and that they have their grandparents to take care of them when im not here
7912862 when i was in afghanistan ellie knew she could look up at the stars and know mommy was looking at the same stars so really i was not that far away
7912863 the mission will get done but the mission is always people first the mission and the people are not separate they are intertwined he puts a lot of importance on the individual soldiers in his command his energy and enthusiasm is contagious he makes you want to be better he makes you want to look to your future
7912864 it will be my duty assignment for two years i will still have a salary my college will be 100 percent paid for and i will have full benefits you cant beat that opportunity in the civilian world

7912946 if i had to pick one thing to point to this past year as tangible progress around our long term strategy it would be strengthened sales of the right mix of specialty ingredients
7912947 specialty protein sales for instance were up double digits in volume as well as in sales revenue
7912948 demand for healthy foods drives our long term opportunity the major food companies are working at breakneck speed to develop new and differentiated products
7912949 we are only beginning to realize the potential of being able to build our role as a value added supplier to our current customers

7912968 this contract order for our custom parts washers and exclusive environment safe cleaning fluids products demonstrates the significant growth potential that bio clean international possesses we believe that bio clean international represents a highly unique low priced high potential growth stock where investors can secure a position in a revenue generating company with exclusive in demand environmental safe products

7912970 we look forward to providing our equipment and environmental safe fluids to our armed forces that provides the safety and security for all americans and various foreign countries worldwide
7912971 this increase in authorized shares on top of our recent strong share repurchase activity is as clear an indication as our board and management can give of our belief that our stock is significantly undervalued
7912972 we continue to believe that the purchase of our stock at these prices will deliver outstanding value to our stockholders and is one of the most appropriate uses of our resources at this time moreover we believe that we can do this without sacrificing expansion capital investment or growth plans
7912973 in analyzing our findings we were somewhat surprised to learn that partners are largely unprepared to handle ownership changes resulting from death disability or termination for example fewer than 30 percent of partners are prepared to deal with the death of a managing partner what was far more astounding however was the number of partners nearly half that did not know how to assess their level of readiness
7912974 this is likely in part because these are difficult issues to deal with from an emotional standpoint however given the profound negative consequences that any uncertainty can have on an enterprise its apparent that the industry has underestimated the importance of thorough contingency planning
7912975 most of the uncertainty surrounding ownership changes results from the lack of a sufficient succession plan of those polled less than one quarter indicated that they have a formal succession plan in place among these firms almost 90 percent believe that they have adequately communicated the elements of their plan to key employees
7912976 however our research suggests that these firms are overrating their level of preparedness as nearly 60 percent have not reviewed the plan in three years or more due to changes to the management structure documents can become quickly outdated and should be reviewed on an annual basis to avoid disruptions to the firm in the event of unanticipated ownership changes

7912983 were not here for a party were here to communicate the significance of this as a crop
7912984 just about all the carmakers are using some kind of a natural fibre technology it just makes economic sense
7912985 and now with oil being expensive the idea of using plant based products to replace oil based products just makes a whole lot of economic sense
7912986 the fibre is useful its a healthy plan good for you and everything why hasnt it taken off
7912987 actually i burned it in a big open area when no one was around
7912988 in retrospect growing the crop is the easy thing taking it all the way to market theres challenges involved when we got going there was no processing infrastructure and not a lot was understood about the markets
7912989 people dont appreciate what has to be done in the development of the infrastructure

7913005 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year

7913008 the expectations index which posted a significant gain this month suggests better times may be ahead however overall readings are still quite low by historical standards and it is still too early to tell if the worst behind us

7913013 the torch will be passed again to a generation of americans
7913014 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7913015 we are told that barack obama believes too much in an america of high purpose and bold endeavor
7913016 but when john kennedy thought of going to the moon he didnt say its too far to get there we shouldnt even try our people answered his call to rise to the challenge and today an american flag still marks the surface of the moon
7913017 this is what we do we reach the moon we scale the heights i know it ive seen it ive lived it and we can do it again
7913018 he kicked the convention off in a way that passes the torch to a new generation of americans and put it in historical perspective in a way that only he could having been at his brothers side in 1960

7913028 is science blogging in india yet to have its time
7913029 when we started to analyze the various markets we were surprised by how little chicken flavor there was in chicken core products
7913030 raised the bar for natural chicken flavors in the industry
7913031 our extensive consumer research conducted in major markets across the globe told us that chicken is a nearly universal comfort food and that consumers want authentic familiar chicken tastes and aromas created by cooking techniques they know and love
7913032 spices and herbs add interest and regional character but the true essence of chicken should shine through
7913033 these chicken profiles can be easily blended with ingredients specific to any locality or cuisine enabling the creation of signature notes for specific product brands
7913034 we brought in a selection of the worlds finest chickens raised on different diets and in a variety of habitats and cooked them open pan slow cook high pressure pan and more using nothing but a pinch of salt as seasoning and found the best target flavor profiles to guide the creative team in the design of this new range

7913039 while the top schools in the u s news ranking do well in terms of financial faculty and alumni resources it is quite clear that in terms of actual academic performance they are simply not placing enough emphasis on the teaching of americas history and founding and subsequently not preparing students to be active citizens this is something both students and their parents should take into account when choosing a college

7913079 research links consumption of nuts or dried fruit with numerous functional benefits such as improved cardiovascular urinary tract neurological and even dental health
7913080 consumption can also be directly linked to reducing risks for cancer and diabetes as well as lowering cholesterol and helping in weight maintenance as media and the industry promote such findings sales for nuts and dried fruit escalate

7913091 appliancesmart has established itself in the atlanta market with four other strongly performing retail outlets we believe our brand of offering customers a wide selection of high quality discount priced appliances has proven to work extremely well in this market the addition of a fifth outlet to serve this market will enable us to increase our market penetration while generating greater economies of scale as we leverage advertising and other overhead expenses

7913105 maybe the early release to bloggers will prove to be a good move on rodney strongs part but when i started seeing all these online reviews of rockaway i really had to wonder why did all those bloggers give it free publicity dont they get free wine every day so why write about rockaway i havent had the wine plan to review it tonight and i have no idea if its any good but it shows how easily some parts of the blogosphere can be manipulated into providing free publicity to wineries
7913106 how exactly is this any different from we or any other glossy getting samples and writing about them isnt that free publicity for the winery
7913107 i did ask rs why they decided to do this and my take on their response was that their pr marketing dept
7913108 right information to the right person at the right time
7913109 there is a theory that most transactions fall down because of a lack of information but more often it is the buyer changing his or her mind or a change in circumstances
7913110 there are five separate industries who are all making good money from the existing broken down house buying and selling process this is a thinly veiled attempt to keep things as they always were
7913111 hips are already bringing benefits to consumers by providing important information to help families cut their fuel bills and carbon emissions and have reduced the price of property searches by increasing transparency in the homebuying and selling process
7913112 we are continuing to work with stakeholders including the naea to consider how the process can be improved further including through enhancing the hip

7913114 our findings clearly demonstrate that cheddar and low fat cheeses are suitable foods for vitamin d3
7913115 these findings will help to validate this approach for expanding the dietary sources of this essential nutrient for consumers this will ultimately increase vitamin d intakes in the population which are currently too low and could help bring about the public health benefits that result from a greater consumption of vitamin d
7913116 to our knowledge the fortification of reduced fat cheese with vitamin d3 has never been reported
7913117 we conclude that industrially manufactured cheddar and low fat cheeses are suitable for vitamin d3 fortification

7913127 i briefed the squad today on the arrangements for the leicester game and immediately there was a feeling of great anticipation
7913128 the overall mood is still one of caution theres not much out there to get investors excited
7913129 but the bigger picture is that there hasnt really been a major breakdown considering all the bad headlines out there from higher oil prices to the credit crisis and troubled housing sector
7913130 the market almost always marks time ahead of a fed announcement and the minutes coming out later has people on the sidelines
7913131 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing
7913132 i think christian people have sat back and been quiet for too long
7913133 i really believe they were going to try to slip in under the radar
7913134 we are developing a coalition here of clergy in our county to fight this on a united front we as followers of christ cant stand by
7913135 quickly act to regulate the wide spread of video bingo in the county
7913136 in some counties without regulation it has created tremendous problems especially in the unincorporated areas that do not have zoning
7913137 they try to pull the wool over the peoples eyes
7913138 but it has been proven over and over again that these promises that are made for solving all these financial woes doesnt happen they say 100 percent of profit will go back into the county but they can set their overhead figures so high that they wont realize a profit
7913139 said he feels that they have violated the constitution by taking this authority into their own hands
7913140 many people are going to say im just one person
7913141 all you have to do is look in gods word noah was one person and god used him
7913142 gods looking for one person to stand in the gap and i want to be that one person i cant speak for anybody else in etowah county but as far as me and my house we are going to serve the lord
7913143 those amendments say that county commissions can pass regulations for the permits
7913144 but they are going far beyond the permits and creating forms of gambling its clear abuse of the amendments its really high stakes gambling they are involved in some lawyer decided it was a loophole and hes created this monster that is taking over alabama
7913145 he has already said in his opinion that electronic bingo is legal
7913146 the people are going to have to bring the lawsuits i believe the alabama supreme court would say electronic bingo in this fashion under these amendments is not legal
7913147 whatever you do he tells you to do your best at it
7913148 he would help kids out who were struggling with grades or family issues whether they had him as a teacher or not
7913149 he was always there talking to somebody or helping them out
7913150 a lot of students come to ask me to pray for their mother father brother or sister
7913151 sometimes we will stop right there in front of the track and pray i think they appreciate the fact that i am real that i care for them
7913152 he was in a panic because he didnt want to change school districts
7913153 someone had broken into her house and raped her in front of her kids
7913154 she couldnt go back to that house and didnt have anywhere to go
7913155 he would break down in tears of joy if one of the lower kids made an improvement
7913156 even if the kid was still in the back of the pack
7913157 i am told i am a hard teacher i dont feel like i am a hard teacher but they say i am
7913158 i dont take excuses i guess the fact that i mean what i say makes me hard i dont do extra credit there isnt extra credit in the real world
7913159 there are a lot of really good teachers but with coach hind you felt more of an attachment to him
7913160 you wanted to do well because you didnt want him to be disappointed in you
7913161 i preach at them all of the time not about christ but about the things that he would expect out of them
7913162 i dont say this is what jesus would want for you but i teach christs moral standards without telling them who the authority is
7913163 he instills in them that they need to have good morals and a good outlook on life
7913164 devon uses the job to teach people about running the race the race that scripture talks about
7913165 i was overwhelmed that so many people would think me worthy of that
7913166 that is the kind of person i want to be one day

7913168 we are essentially mimicking what happens in the body when scavenger cells remove dead and abnormal cells if the dead cells are not removed then this affects how healthy cells behave
7913169 not only will this make the production of drugs more efficient but it will also streamline research into new medicines which use cell culture
7913170 we have developed a method that enables us to visualise fingerprints even after the print itself has been removed
7913171 for the first time we can get prints from people who handled a cartridge before it was fired wiping it down washing it in hot soapy water makes no difference and the heat of the shot helps the process we use
7913172 the procedure works by applying an electric charge to a metal say a gun or bullet which has been coated in a fine conducting powder similar to that used in photocopiers
7913173 even if the fingerprint has been washed off it leaves a slight corrosion on the metal and this attracts the powder when the charge is applied so showing up a residual fingerprint
7913174 the technique works on everything from bullet casings to machine guns even if heat vaporises normal clues police will be able to prove who handled a particular gun
7913175 climate is the culprit i dont think there is any iota of reason not to think that
7913176 eventually its going to get shoved off these mountains and go extinct
7913177 animals that are relatively static have a much more limited ability to move if climate changes faster than they can find new habitat theyre out of business
7913178 wed be sitting in camp and wed both be skinning pretty soon hed throw a rat over to me and hed say here russell finish this one up and hed just pick up his notebook and start writing
7913179 we never traveled one inch but what he had that notebook open and writing notes
7913180 have just heard the loud hard clattering call of a belted kingfisher as i sat down four deer were walking about the doe has now just gotten excited and given eight rather loud snorts in irregular succession
7913181 at 7 000 feet heard a very loud pounding i followed the racket and came across a pileated woodpecker
7913182 the beauty of the field notes is they describe in great detail where grinnell was camping and where he set his trap lines
7913183 we can often go to the exact same place and see whats there now
7913184 historic records for yosemite indicate theres been about a 5 degree fahrenheit increase in the maximum summer temperature for any given elevation
7913185 now if you happen to see one you consider yourself pretty lucky
7913186 if you read their notes they saw it every day
7913187 were never going to learn about the biology of the animal here in yosemite because we cant find them
7913188 this afternoon i noted some alpine chipmunks feasting on a sandwich i had thrown out
7913189 it involves changing rainfall patterns changes in the timing and deposition in the amount of snow
7913190 we know chipmunks feed a lot on seeds if we have a change in the pattern of snow deposition theres a good likelihood well see changes in the distribution of plants if that happens the plants they rely on may go away
7913191 b reusable coffee mug ceramic approx 8 charge after min qty level discount
7913192 b reusable coffee mug ceramic approx 3 charge after min qty level discount
7913193 use your own quantity levels and pricing as well as discounts off of list price this is only an example
7913194 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7913195 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7913196 what do you think will happen to linux if you were to get hit by a bus
7913197 it puts russia of course in opposition to a number of to which it is party most appallingly as a member of the p 5
7913198 we obviously cant allow what russias done to go without there being some consequences
7913199 it simply means that the russian president continues not to honor the commitments that the russians have signed on to
7913200 while there have been some significant russian movements they are not yet living up to the terms of the cease fire agreement
7913201 i feel strongly that combining history and theater gives us all a chance to look at the world in a new way and become more responsible citizens
7913202 the sun represents the source of interminable energy white is purity and a mixture of all colours and green acknowledges the farmers and their green fields at the same time these colors also represent various religions hinduism islam and christianity
7913203 the people who are numerically in large numbers are getting fewer opportunities and people with lesser numbers are getting more opportunities it has to be balanced to create a sense of participation among all sections of people
7913204 we will honor the self respect and sentiments of the people of telangana
7913205 if separation becomes inevitable we will do it in a respectable and harmonious way we will help and cooperate in this direction
7913206 because poverty and economic backwardness does not have any religion or caste
7913207 so much love for one individual my heart is full of gratitude for the way you kept me in your heart and nourished me for the last thirty years what i am today is only because of you
7913208 it looks as if entire andhra pradesh has gathered at the feet of tirumala hills
7913209 in this battle courage and honesty are the only two weapons we have
7913210 service is more important not the power service is our aim we will have to bring back respect to politics let the opponents talk find fault and denigrate us our only response should be service service and service
7913211 after proper discussion we will come out with a scientific policy on this issue

7913228 our case is about freedom of opinion it is not a criminal one we demand a national programme for democratic change that begins with the right of expression
7913229 under the syrian constitution a defendant is innocent until proven guilty the prosecution cannot be excused from presenting proof of guilt unless the intention of the court is to convict regardless
7913230 the authorities want to show that theyre providing a semblance of judicial fairness for high profile opposition figures but this a politicised trial par excellence
7913231 this is a sensitive time and we need to make sure we reach a solution one way or another
7913232 it is important that when the club has done something good for you you do something good for the club
7913233 the reason i left bayern is because i didnt get the minutes i wish i had
7913234 the lads here give me the confidence to believe that my body is 100 okay and to play as well as i used to
7913235 now im very relaxed and confident that this season can be as good as the last one especially because i feel good in training
7913236 for me it was always clear before signing the deal i had three years to go with blackburn so the club were the ones deciding what happens with my future
7913237 they understand that im very ambitious but what they offer is the chance for me to become a better player
7913238 its a tough tournament to win rafa has never been beyond the quarters so thats definitely the advantage i carry to the other players
7913239 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s open
7913240 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time being no 1 so it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and hes played so well on all surfaces now
7913241 maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having no 1 next to me and it should be interesting
7913242 rovers will not be pursuing an interest in bolton goalkeeper ali al habsi
7913243 if he thought william was the best captain for the club then he is the man to call it
7913244 i am not really there a lot of people throw stones but i am not prepared to do that because i dont know the situation
7913245 he thinks he is the best captain for the club and i am not going to argue with his record
7913246 they need a bit of experience a couple of players
7913247 he believes in his squad and the talent he has got there i just think you need a couple more winners who have been there seen it and done it
7913248 for me they made a big error and the big mistake was not keeping on sol and ashley a little bit longer
7913249 i know they had the situation if you speak to arsene ashley wanted to go and whatever but i would have got them in my office and handcuffed them even though they werent performing
7913250 it was just for the transition all the kids come in and all the kids are there together everyone retired together the back four retired pretty much together patrick went dennis bergkamp all the people who knew the club inside out and knew how to be winners knew what to do
7913251 all the kids they are tremendously talented probably technically better than he has ever had it is the most technical squad he has ever had but they need to learn to become winners there is no one really who has made the transition
7913252 we made the offer to the tatas to relocate long before any other state but we are yet to hear from them
7913253 we always welcome investments by big industry groups in gujarat in fact the state is ready 365 days a year for fresh investments
7913254 labour costs will be low and it is easy to procure steel from jamshedpur the tatas are also developing a port in orissa
7913255 reports of violence against a minority community are outrageous efforts must be made to rein in violence and the centre must intervene effectively to restore peace in the state
7913256 we will apprise home minister patil of the sad feedback the ncm is getting from people in the state we will also send our own delegation to the state to take stock of ground realities
7913257 the finance minister was optimistic of an eight to nine percent growth
7913258 our second demand is to ban bajrang dal because the remarkable thing about the blasts is that the technology which was used in the kanpur blasts was superior and more sophisticated than that of other blasts normally that kind of technology is used by army having said this it raises lots of questions to be answered about the nature of the organization and the kinds of activities that bajrang dal is engaged in
7913259 kanpur blast is the tip of the iceberg if the government seriously investigates this blast including the recent nanded bomb blasts ahmadabad and jaipur bomb blasts from cbi then real people involved in these blasts in india would be exposed
7913260 as for now these people are lucky that they have got the terrorist image of muslims which helps them evade and the innocent muslims are put behind the bars
7913261 kanpur explosion is important in two respects one is that till now there used to be a belief that bajrang dal is not involved in terror activities but this incident has exposed the picture which was being painted till now which was actually a facade
7913262 the slackness by the media in covering this issue it treated it as if it is not news had it been any muslim then you would have seen its activism
7913263 it is a long time since the hindutva forces have been benefited by the image of muslims as terrorists and by the benefit of doubt the government must act now otherwise it would snowball into a serious problem for the secular interests of india
7913264 they just need to manage the language that already exists
7913265 vous voulez appeler a une guerre je ne vais pas me battre sur la d finition ce sont des op rations meurtri res et ce sont des op rations de guerre
7913266 il nemp che que pour nous qui navons pas d clar la guerre et qui ne ferons pas larmistice et qui ne ferons pas la paix nous sommes engag s dans une mission des nations unies une mission de soutien un gouvernement qui existe
7913267 mais a fait rien parlons de la guerre puisque vraiment lhorreur de ce que nous venons de d crire est suffisante pour employer ce terme ndlr
7913268 nous ne sommes pas en guerre contre un etat nous sommes sous mandat des nations unies avec 39 pays de la communaut internationale qui luttent contre le terrorisme et nous ne sommes absolument pas en guerre contre lafghanistan ou contre le peuple

7913272 the ancient greeks plato more specifically established a hierarchy in the arts by elevating the purely contemplative art forms from the lower functional crafts this idea again struck me as i was taking down yet another of my gallery installations and jamming the mere functional remains into a dumpster i had adopted a belief that artistic expression was a vital bridge spanning the distance between idea and reality which in turn established a situation of exchange for both mental insight and physical experience it was through this belief that i made artworks for the gallery however back in 1987 in a parking lot in a dumpster i had questions i could envision a painting which inspired awe throughout the gallery being relocated in the parking lot where every patron would drive over it as they backed their cars out and headed home i saw that the gallery had become the sanctuary for the pure contemplative art object and that the gallery walls protected it from the realities of functional mundanely this rarified space filled with what appeared to be objects which could not support life on their own seemed completely non vital to me i was moved to reincorporate the contemplative and functional in a body of work the bicycle i thought would be the natural vehicle aesthetically it engages the viewer immediately with its figurative suggestions and strong compositional geometries and because it is a functional machine with a commonly shared childhood experience i felt it elicited a kinesthetic accessibility for the viewer folk wisdom claims that you never forget how to ride a bicycle i remember as a child being schooled on the inventive spirits of thomas edison benjamin franklin and the wright brothers the latter who took the seminal machine of that time the bicycle and invented the airplane of course todays advances in technology leave one about as uncomfortable as staring at the instrument panel of an airline jet human tools are rapidly converting human beings into human subjects who regularly pray and curse at their cars and computers in a somewhat don quixote fashion i make these machines to remind myself and others what it means to be human what restrictions are implied therein and what dreams seek expression beyond

7913326 there are two ways to make an inexpensive laptop one way is to take cheap components cheap labor cheap design and make a cheap laptop
7913327 we decided to do the opposite cool design and very advanced manufacturing techniques where you pour raw materials in one end and out come ipods out the other end that approach is normally not the one taken in the developing world
7913328 you see very inexpensive white boxes that are near garbage both in terms of design and manufacturing
7913329 i tried to get one of the largest laptop brands to sponsor the program they said no they looked at my design and said this design would require at least 15 miracles and we have this rule around here one miracle per product were going to pass but keep in touch it was a very nice sort of rejection
7913330 they were dead right one miracle per product was a pretty good rule for a product but this wasnt a product it was a global humanitarian effort
7913331 the decision was made yesterday after the olpcs board of directors reviewed bids from several possible manufacturing companies

7913369 rapid integration with our microsoft based infrastructure and our existing banking applications and the ability to scale right up to a million users were also key factors in our decision
7913370 we are really pleased to be working with dubai bank to secure access to their on line banking systems it is yet another example of how important the internet is to trading and how 2fa reduces the risks for both the bank and its customers

7913406 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
7913407 some players are already wearing skirts i think its a good idea the game already looks more beautiful than before
7913408 although the skirts are just a small part of the changes they may spark a revolution by changing the image of table tennis
7913409 it might be a revolution if women paddlers wear skirts during games just like tennis and badminton players which will definitely help win back the lost interest in the game

7913422 once an entity has established itself as a de facto state it will benefit from territorial integrity and certain guarantees of sovereignty

7913435 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
7913436 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues

7913442 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
7913443 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt

7913556 no tenemos ni idea de como es posible que una persona cuya desaparicion ha sido denunciada hace tanto tiempo no fuese encontrada antes en su propio apartamento
7913557 cuando los oficiales entraron parecia que el lugar se habia quedado congelado en el tiempo
7913558 la casa estaba llena de objetos que nadie ha visto durante decadas nada habia sido movido ni cambiado en todo este tiempo

7913575 as scientists were excited about this discovery because its a fundamentally new approach to regulating what enzymes do in cells
7913576 the fact that it also offers a potentially novel use of a drug already widely in use for other applications is an unexpected bonus
7913577 understanding how the cell works should allow us to affect the activity of enzymes in one neighborhood and leave alone their identical twins in a different neighborhood in that cell
7913578 the idea is to use a pde5 inhibitor such as viagra selectively to inhibit platelet function
7913579 businesses globally are spending considerable time and resources on new customer experience initiatives to improve relationships and help drive organic growth
7913580 ibms strength in hardware software and services combines perfectly with chordiants expertise in decision based front office solutions for our chosen verticals
7913581 our partnership with ibm gives us the global reach and deployment resources we need to complete large scale projects such as ing poland successfully
7913582 its a partnership that complements our strengths perfectly as global brands continue to seek out ways to upgrade the management of their complex multi channel customer interactions we look forward to continuing to partner with ibm to solve these real world problems together

7913588 mother as laughter filled the air you taught me to play and to always be fair

7913590 mother i miss you so much as on my cheek i feel a tear and i hunger for your touch
7913591 having such distinguished writers involved with this project both sets a wonderful inspiration for indigenous children and also sends a really strong message about how important our efforts are
7913592 and it is wonderful to see an industry that is all about reading and is all about books reach out to indigenous communities and say we think it is just as important that you have access to appropriate and interesting well written reading material as everybody else
7913593 i love to read it gives me enormous joy to hear of these youngsters learning to write and of course being able to read themselves
7913594 i dont think the government intended for a moment to introduce a budget that would result in funding cuts to public education but the government must take immediate action to introduce measures not only to avoid this unintended consequence but to dramatically increase funding for public education to restore some balance
7913595 if there were no countervailing increases in state and territory funding for teachers the impact of commonwealth funding would be a reduction of more than 1000 teaching staff in public schools by 2012
7913596 it is as if the machinery inherent in the howard governments policies is driving the rudd governments agenda almost independently of its own stated priorities

7913598 there will be criticism from some inside and outside the company that these changes particularly in editorial will compromise quality and critical mass in the metro mastheads and their mission
7913599 we reject that this initiative has been carefully constructed by the publishers with full regard for the integrity of their mastheads our mastheads will remain true to their heritage and their values of quality andexcellence
7913600 you would expect them to say they can maintain quality
7913601 time will tell but you will not find many editors who have figured out how you can lose several hundred staff and keep up the quality without a magic potion
7913602 i was responsible for starting a lot of these sections at a time when the smh had no sections at all
7913603 but the newspapers have gone far too far down the lifestyle track they have done it because they believe these sections command benefits in additional advertising
7913604 after fuelling growth in these sections for two decades it would now be not a bad thing at all if the reduction in costs came from cuts to lifestyle
7913605 what those of us who care about journalism say is that there should be less of this death by a thousand cuts and a deeper analysis and reinvention
7913606 we dont manufacture widgets here or car tyres we responsibly provide information to people
7913607 the point we make is that quality depends on individual journalists and the teams of journalists they put together they seem to want to actively break up the teams and the esprit de corps
7913608 management simply doesnt value quality and this new round of redundancies is another example of it
7913609 you cant expect quality wont be affected when you take out so many
7913610 the people likely to go are the most experienced and valued journalists whom fairfax sees as the most expensive newspapers all over the world are struggling and the ones that are doing better are the ones who are investing in their staff
7913611 we must tell people what they want to know and even more important what they might not want to know about war politics economics schools corruption and the thoughts and deeds of those who lead us we need to tell readers more about barack obama and less about britney spears
7913612 if you look at readership and circulation trends over the last few years newspapers with markets that are very clearly defined very targeted are still growing
7913613 this includes regional dailies like the geelong advertiser and townsville daily bulletin or the gold coast bulletin the national daily the australian its a serious political newspaper were still growing i think the fin is holding on better than the smh and the age it knows its market it is a business newspaper but its those papers that are trying to be all things to all people in the capital cities that are struggling
7913614 its instructive that management at fairfax sees that their core business is in fact lifestyle journalism because lifestyle journalism is just as vulnerable to the internet as classifieds were
7913615 theres not much in lifestyle journalism that you cant get provided easily online and its very cheap for internet providers
7913616 lost confidence in the fairfax board and its ability to manage the company through these challenging financial times when its only strategy is to cut editorial staff again and again
7913617 we believe fairfax is abandoning the quality journalism market leaving a hollow ring to david kirks commitment to uphold these values
7913618 media companies fit for the modern media world need to be lean and agile
7913619 management is clearly struggling to deal with how to handle the complex demands of high end quality journalism
7913620 our newspapers will remain true to their heritage and their values of quality and excellence
7913621 in a week when weve invested in the product and we continue to invest in our people the story out of fairfax is that theyre cutting 550 jobs
7913622 to lose 80 journalists i struggle to see how you can do that without affecting quality
7913623 what would produce a solid financial return yesterday will not do so tomorrow
7913624 in the release of our annual results you would have noticed that the metropolitan mastheads financial position has declined
7913625 because ur sucking on my head and screaming out brendon

7913629 i think the direction of the club is always paramount
7913630 the club is bigger than any individual but having said that it was a very tough decision for the club to move forward we needed to make that decision
7913631 if i take my playing cap off and look at it from an outside perspective we all want the club to succeed and move forward to playing finals footy and i totally understand my delisting
7913632 but from a personal point of view i still feel like ive got some time left
7913633 im not hanging my hat on getting a spot at an afl club next year but im definitely putting my hand up to say look my mind feels good my body feels good i want to continue playing
7913634 jimmy stynes came to me to say that you need two more games for life membership
7913635 to play last week and obviously to get up this week to be a life member of the afl is something i can really be proud of

7913638 the obvious reason is he was the words greatest ever batsman and no one will ever match that
7913639 also he almost touched australians individually because he was such a conscientious corespondent everyone who wrote to him got a reply
7913640 he was widely loved for the fact that he recognised everyday australians and felt it was his duty to write back to them because of his ambassadorial role
7913641 we call this the spiritual home of cricket because this is where the young bradman learnt to play cricket
7913642 this is where his ashes and his wifes ashes were scattered so it has that spiritual element and it has that historical element because it the town hasnt changed greatly physically since he was here

7913645 it is unacceptable that our council is being bypassed and not consulted over the location of this new bail hostels in the local area by a private company
7913646 its imperative that councils are involved from day one in helping to decide where to locate any proposed bail hostel
7913647 clearsprings is contractually obliged to consult before locating its hostels i cannot believe that they havent even consulted me and my fellow wensum ward local councillors on this
7913648 i am outraged by their casual disregard of the rules and of the safety of my constituents
7913649 we should have been told about the hostel i am concerned about it because i have small children we have seen a lot more police activity since they moved there including in the last week or so it makes me uneasy
7913650 we should have been told it could lead to more crime or anything on the estate
7913651 some councillors are understandably furious that they have not been adequately consulted on what is happening in their area
7913652 its pure folly to dump this kind of accommodation in the middle of a residential street without properly asking for the councils views
7913653 the failure to consult genuinely with councils gives the unfortunate impression that they are established under a veil of secrecy this doesnt help the people on bail or on early release who come up against resentment from local people who have been unnecessarily alarmed
7913654 we have got to make sure we dont allow offenders or ex offenders to carry on offending we need to break that cycle and one way to help do that is to recognise accommodation is an integral part of that if it is in a managed environment as far as i am concerned these are perfectly safe and well controlled
7913655 were aware of three premises operated by clearsprings in the city
7913656 the city council is not planning any enforcement action on these premises one has previously been investigated and there was not found to be a problem so the case was closed if any issues do arise we will take appropriate action
7913657 if anyone reports crimes there we would investigate them we take any reports of criminal activity seriously and are aware there have been problems there before
7913658 it is privately run we have spoken to the company when we had reports and worked with them but do not have any role dealing with their running as it is a probation issue
7913659 clearsprings has a contractual obligation to consult the police enforcement agencies and local authorities to inform the area in which that property will be opened
7913660 people in this accommodation are mostly on bail that means they havent been convicted of any crime and havent been remanded in custody in court as they are not deemed to be a threat to the public
7913661 when people are released on bail they mostly go to their homes and their neighbours are not consulted then all these are doing is providing rental accommodation for people if they havent got anywhere to stay
7913662 defendants who pose a threat to the public continue to be held in custody anyone accused of sexual offences arson or deemed a threat to staff or other residents are not housed in these properties
7913663 more than half of those in this accommodation are on bail and others are on home detention curfews and assessed as low risk on entry and monitored in their stay and liable to recall to prison if they break their terms

7913666 we wanted to do it around an event that people are excited about which is music
7913667 it is smaller scale pilot programs like this that provide a great learning environment where the company can try out new ideas and implement them right away
7913668 its basically just harvesting what everyone is already doing and creating a platform to allow them to do more with it
7913669 this tent idea is new to me but i like it and i think it would take off in spain and other countries in europe
7913670 i drive around looking at every wall thinking is this a highly trafficked wall is it worth doing im a pretty intuitive person so i try to feel things
7913671 the first place i walked into the guy was really excited about the prospect of a mural
7913672 his wall had some nasty stuff on it at the time and he said ok as long as there was a picture of his pit bull in the mural i love dogs and animals and i love pit bulls actually theyre sweet dogs controversial dogs i like controversial subjects
7913673 i dont have insurance and back surgery is fifty five thousand bucks
7913674 i had these dreams that were unrealistic so i had to do something large scale to make them happen
7913675 i have a vision for my street work thats a little different than my gallery work
7913676 i wanted it to have a really strong emotional content of compassion and imagination and tie the two together in a way that is fun for people to look at
7913677 i bought this in february or march and i was feeling a lot like the moose at the time
7913678 id only been open for half a year and i wasnt sure where the gallery was going or where i was going i was so glad once i put wards stuff up every time im down i look at his stuff and it brings me up
7913679 when i was in thailand i worked with burmese refugee monks teaching them english in exchange for room and board theyre people that i really care about and id like to see the burmese situation noticed in the news id go into burma and do a mural go into calcutta and do a mural go into tijuana and do a border mural i do want to be successful as an artist but i also want to be a soldier for the people i guess for the people who have the least and are the most oppressed
7913680 hes been a big inspiration to me as well he traveled the united states living in his volkswagen van and ive lived in vehicles
7913681 both fixed and mobile network operators were offering their services within a limited geographical area which defined the boundaries of their markets today however it
7913682 he performed a particular task more effectively than anyone before or since more effectively perhaps than any other australian has performed theirs
7913683 the task was to be sure narrow and highly specialised yet bradman sustained a gargantuan superiority over a period of 20 years
7913684 still the most compelling aspect of the legend is the average one hundred is not the maximum possible arithmetic mean score in cricket but 99 94 with its tincture of human fallibility could not have been more exquisitely contrived
7913685 to a generation addicted to measurement and saturated in numbers the average is monolithic unassailable totemic
7913686 yet by the average it would seem are we largely to know him there is a certain comfort in calling bradman great and leaving it at that
7913687 with the freedom to review bradmans life backwards we regularly overlook that he lived his life forwards that deeds seemingly inevitable were achievements of flesh blood and spirit
7913688 while bradman lived there remained a sense of wonder that such a small frail soft spoken and self contained man could cast such a long shadow
7913689 now as the australia of which bradman was part recedes into antiquity he is at risk of becoming a mere statistical outlier
7913690 it put a couple of people on notice theres no doubt about that
7913691 not by specifically naming names but i think everyone is thinking in their back of their head was he talking about me
7913692 if we have to make changes players will be tapped on the shoulder and changes will be made
7913693 but theres a lot of things that have got to be done as well as player recruitment
7913694 i think youre dragging stuff out of me i dont want to talk about
7913695 im just trying to focus on the game against the sharks our seasons not finished
7913696 it was disappointing last week and the week before 40 12 loss to parramatta very disappointing
7913697 weve got to look at a whole host of things but now were concentrating on friday and thats really all i want to work on
7913698 weve just got to play for that and let things fall where they fall

7913719 its lifted the profile for us were getting more corporate interest in the sport and hopefully it brings more kids to the sport and we can have a bigger league in australia

7913723 scotiabanks strategy of diversifying across business lines and geographies has enabled the bank to continue to perform well during a challenging period for the global financial services industry
7913724 total revenue grew 5 from the same period last year as assets increased a strong 54 billion or 13 with contributions from all three growth platforms domestic banking international banking and scotia capital
7913725 domestic banking reported a record quarter with total revenue increasing by 9 compared to a year ago
7913726 mortgage growth was recorded in all sales channels leading to a gain in market share while personal deposits grew 12 to lead the industry in market share growth
7913727 results in international banking benefited from continued robust organic loan growth particularly in mortgages and credit cards strong deposit gains and the positive impact of acquisitions partly offset by higher taxes and increased provisions for credit losses
7913728 scotia capital had a strong quarter benefitting from its diversified portfolio of businesses with record revenues in scotia waterous and fixed income continued strong contributions from scotiamocatta and foreign exchange operations and an increased contribution from its lending businesses
7913729 the banks risk management culture is enabling us to effectively manage through a difficult period in world capital markets
7913730 our capital position remains strong allowing the bank to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and ongoing business development opportunities
7913731 the second half of 2008 is showing improvement compared to the first two quarters of the fiscal year with continued asset growth in all three business lines and a rebound in capital markets activity while we are on track to achieve three of our four key financial and operational targets with slower global growth it is unlikely that we will meet our eps growth objectives as set at the end of last year

7913743 the smartest employers will have a huge advantage if they pinch the best of those valued older workers who have had experience of the tough times
7913744 we have seen a shift in peoples mindsets about employing older workers because the ageing population means they must broaden their pool of talent from which to select
7913745 there is an increased understanding that the older worker has some wonderful transferable characteristics which are welcome in the workplace
7913746 when there is skills shortages and an ageing demographic wise employers will tap into the skills experience maturity and capability of the older worker to benefit their businesses

7913866 but he was a genius an absolute genius and certainly the best manager i played under without a shadow of a doubt
7913867 i just feel very lucky like other players who played under him to have had that opportunity he was a genius and he has still left his mark on the football club forest

7913948 was always thought to be a fixed property of the material but what we realized was that it is not only the material that is quantized that has discrete states but the photons also are part of a field that has quantized states
7913949 emission comes by coupling these two fields we now feel that by using an electric field we can change the electronic structure of nanotubes so that heat cannot be generated
7913950 next week there cant be any crisis my schedule is already full

7913957 rang undang undang ini sulit apatah lagi semasa ketua polis negara memberikan taklimat berhubung rang undang undang ini hanya anggota parlimen daripada kelab penyokong kerajaan yang dipanggil
7913958 bila taklimat tidak diberi tetapi tiba tiba rang undang undang ini hendak dibentangkan ini tidak prihatin kepada kami anggota parlimen pembangkang

7913966 it puts russia of course in opposition to a number of security council resolutions to which it is party most appallingly as a member of the p 5
7913967 we obviously cant allow what russias done to go without there being some consequences
7913968 it simply means that the russian president continues not to honor the commitments that the russians have signed on to
7913969 while there have been some significant russian movements they are not yet living up to the terms of the cease fire agreement

7914147 i would have done whatever to try to get him back initially but now how could you not want him back
7914148 wouldnt that be something he comes back and we start a trend
7914149 as i know it he is probably on a beach somewhere sipping on some pina coladas so i doubt football is the first thing on his mind today
7914150 he has not been bouncing back and forth like favre

7914152 it is something that he all of us really wanted but obviously we didnt want these circumstances for him to get back
7914153 it is a good thing for him it is a good thing for this team he is definitely a d lineman at heart and hopefully he can just come back in and not miss a beat
7914154 he is another one of those infectious personalities so his personality and his mind state are always going to be at the utmost highest so i am not worried about him on that point

7914381 while many bands who reunite years after they parted cant find the old thread or cant advance it the verve has taken their core character and moved it a bracing step ahead
7914382 but appalachian springs gives the best afterglow built on the ballad prayer model of the drugs dont work on 1997s urban hymns and coated in mccabes melting guitars and ashcrofts higher than you bleating it is forth s final trackk and most complete trip

7914394 and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
7914395 i have come here tonight to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7914396 together we have known success and seen failure victory and defeat
7914397 for me this is a season of hope new hope and this is the cause of my life new hope that we will break the old gridlock
7914398 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
7914399 has been a senator for all who believe that the dream has never died
7914400 two men who have changed my life and the life of this country
7914401 but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7914402 when he is president he will have no stronger partner in the united states senate
7914403 os cidadaos comuns tamb m podem participar do leilao caso se interessem
7914404 main aim is to push for better safety standards on filmsets in germany
7914405 that everyone on the set knew that the vehicles were in terrible shape
7914406 his name and what he achieved its so far out of any players reach in his time or any player who has played since its almost like he played a different game to what were playing
7914407 he would have been the stand out player whatever generation he played in
7914408 they talk about someone being the don bradman of aussie rules they equate other superstars in other sports to being somewhere near him which is pretty remarkable
7914409 is there anyone whos ever played any sport whos been able to achieve that level of greatness
7914410 what would the olympic equivalent be throwing the javelin 25 metres further than the next guy it would be a fairly dramatic increase on current records if you compared it to an olympic sport
7914411 the first thing that struck you was his stature he was quite a short little guy and very quietly spoken
7914412 but everyone in that room was in awe and everyone was sitting on the edge of their seat taking in everything he would say
7914413 i can remember just hearing his old interviews recorded before i was alive and hearing him play and as a public speaker
7914414 the springboks will get worse if they continue in this way

7914419 theyre attacking off everything and theyre going lateral not through defences you have to go through sides like australia and new zealand first
7914420 but he has to change his philosophy because it doesnt fit these players its not credible
7914421 peters big test now is to learn if he learns he can turn it around but if he continues to be stubborn he wont last long because his tactics wont work
7914422 if a company is doing badly then you blame the managing director so it is right and fair that the coach be held responsible
7914423 peter de villiers his management team and playing squad have my unequivocal backing
7914424 peters future is secure we are not in the business of sacking springbok coaches within three months of their first match

7914610 innanzitutto chiederemo provocatoriamente a questi giovani che cosa significhi essere italiani nel mondo nel 2020 2025 io mi aspetto risposte fuori dalle consuetudini dalle logiche dei patronati e dei sindacati per capire davvero cosa siano lidentit nazionale e quella culturale cosa voglia dire essere una comunit nazionale ci sono molti cittadini che hanno il passaporto italiano e che sono a tutti gli effetti cittadini italiani ma che non conoscono nemmeno la nostra lingua

7914620 but you know what kind of disturbs me sometimes because a lot of people ask me about this ps3 360 question is that its not about the hardware i want people to look at the game itself

7914625 but for developers and you could take someone like for example a great game it takes a lot of time to develop they need a little bit of funding external development in exchange its exclusive that works so exclusivity possibly with developers is more likely than exclusivity with publishers

7914780 were finding so many mothers are vitamin d deficient themselves that the milk is therefore deficient so many babies cant keep their levels up they may start their lives vitamin d deficient and then all theyre getting is vitamin d deficient breast milk
7914781 these things can tend to be a little self serving and self aggrandizing
7914782 youre faced with a real tough question whats your life
7914783 you face a moment where you think do i come back
7914784 you have to look at it really hard and have the discipline to say i stepped aside for a reason
7914785 your life grooved into that thing you became that job like a quarterback does
7914786 we have had more companies encouraging people to retire early recently but a lot of them simply take the retirement money and go do something else
7914787 we do know that most retired people no matter the reason they retired work at least part time
7914788 there are people with real financial issues and challenges once they retire im not one of them
7914789 if you are lucky enough to tap into a passion and your career happens to match your passion thats great the hard part after retiring is the passion keeps bubbling up
7914790 maybe its a guy thing if the guy has had so much of his identity wrapped up in his profession and hasnt developed other areas of his life to their fuller capacity
7914791 but i would guess that many women now could be experiencing the same kind of thing a transition like this requires a whole reorganization of self and daily life
7914792 the energy required to devote oneself to athletic performance or other pursuits is enormous
7914793 and then when it pays off with recognition that recognition becomes its own high the absence of the adrenaline rush of attention feels more like a depression than a normal state and that can create internal panic
7914794 if youve been at the same job a long time theres a burnout factor your initial reaction is to get away from this totally
7914795 but then you realize i dont want to do nothing you still have youth and all your skills but you dont want to get back in a situation where it has control of you
7914796 i thought i probably could still play but when i retired i was done there were so many things i wanted to do outside baseball
7914797 i had a 2 year old daughter and wanted to watch her grow up
7914798 its working great because you can do it on your own time and turn down assignments
7914799 your friends come out of the woodwork and say could you redo my basement
7914800 but i retired because i wanted to spend more time with my partner mark get my life in order so i still work more than i expected to
7914801 i often go for a walk there or ride through on my bike
7914802 the sight of a feather in a peacocks tail whenever i gaze at it makes me sick
7914803 a human being with foibles and contradictions like the rest of us
7914804 i cant understand why they make such a fuss about don all he was good at was cricket
7914805 we wanted to remember grandpa and grandma and honour what they stood for
7914806 unsere erfahrungen zeigen eindeutig dass sich jugendliche sehr wohl bewegen lassen
7914807 entscheidend sind das engagement der betreuerinnen und der wichtigsten bezugspersonen der kinder sowie die schaffung von gen gend gelegenheiten zur k rperlichen aktivit t und zwar zeitlich wie auch r umlich und an dieser stelle sind alle gefordert eltern lehrerinnen und lehrer betreuerinnen und betreuer
7914808 der tagesablauf von jugendlichen hat sich in den vergangenen jahrzehnten massiv ver ndert
7914809 so verbringen etwa 10 bis 14 j hrige im schnitt 7 4 stunden hinter der schulbank der weg dorthin und von der schule nach hause wird immer seltener zu fu oder mit dem fahrrad zur ckgelegt hinzu kommen eine vielzahl von sitzenden freizeitaktivit ten so verbringen laut aktuellen untersuchungen fast die h lfte der sterreichischen sch lerinnen und sch ler in der altersgruppe der 10 bis 14 j hrigen im schnitt 2 stunden vor dem fernseher pc und spielkonsolen sind weitere attraktive freizeitalternativen da bleibt schlicht keine zeit mehr f r k rperliche aktivit t
7914810 die risiken f r gesundheitliche langzeitfolgen aufgrund mangelnder bewegung und damit verbundenem bergewicht sind betr chtlich entscheidend ist dabei vor allem die tatsache dass bewegung und richtige ern hrung im kindesalter gelernt werden daher setzen wir vom forum ern hrung heute mit unseren aktivit ten auch genau an dieser stelle an
7914811 mit unseren take away bungen geben wir den couch potatoes unter den kindern und jugendlichen eine m glichkeit schnell und einfach die dringend notwendige bewegungsration f r den tag zu bekommen
7914812 und dies ist heutzutage absolut entscheidend denn was in den letzten jahrzehnten an allt glicher bewegung verloren gegangen ist wirkt sich letztlich in der energiebilanz der jugendlichen deutlich negativ aus
7914813 der pubert tsknick hat sich auch im schuljahr 2007 08 deutlich gezeigt erkl rtes ziel des projekts schule bewegt bewegte schule ist es diesen motivationseinbruch bei jugendlichen in der altersgruppe der 10 bis 14 j hrigen abzufedern
7914814 these findings are important because while genes that cause hpe have been identified the interactions among those that produce hpe are not only complex but poorly understood
7914815 this represents a first step in understanding the mechanism of that interaction
7914816 this is good evidence for what has been called the multi hit model of hpe
7914817 in this model it takes mutations in both six3 and other genes in the sonic hedgehog pathway to produce the severe pathology of hpe
7914818 sonic hedgehog is a major player in embryonic development in the brain as well as elsewhere in the body
7914819 so this new understanding of its regulation in this very limited time and place in the brain helps us understand at a molecular level some of its overall role in brain formation
7914820 even though pneumococcus is very common until recently no one had realized that it could develop this pilus to reach out and touch a human cell
7914821 oral streptococci which are normally in the mouth and throat have the pilus genetic package and we believe pneumococcus picked it up in the back of the throat we decided to look at how the bacterium figures out how to use that package
7914822 when bacteria attack the lung there are two steps they need to do to establish pneumonia
7914823 they need to stick to lung cells and they also need to invade the lung cells our experiments were designed to separately test those two steps and we established that the pili are not used for adhesion but for invasion which was not understood before
7914824 so far only 20 percent or so of the clinically important strains of pneumococci have developed this trick of producing the proteins for making pili
7914825 in creating vaccines we want to use proteins that occur in a wide variety of bacterial strains these pili related proteins are not prime candidates so we can now concentrate on other proteins that we know are expressed almost universally by pneumococci and that we can put into a vaccine
7914826 current vaccines used in the developed world cost over 100 a dose and are limited to protecting against perhaps 10 to 15 types of pneumococci
7914827 but that price is far too high for developing countries and there are 90 types of pneumococci out there
7914828 this finding represents a key extension of other studies on puma because such loss had never been shown before in human cancer
7914829 on the one hand patients receiving traditional chemotherapy can suffer the loss of immune cells and this loss occurs in part because puma induces the death of these cells
7914830 in this case the goal would be to protect patients bone marrow by developing drugs to inhibit puma on the other hand for patients with a lymphoma in which puma was inactivated drugs could be used to reactivate the gene to trigger apoptosis and kill the tumor cells
7914831 ich kenne keine mannschaft die solche stammkr fte ersetzen kann das kann auch der fc bayern nicht so ohne weiteres
7914832 ich bin optimistisch dass wir jetzt auch die stabilit t reinkriegen die wir brauchen mit der r ckkehr eines martin demichelis
7914833 van bommel ist ein unbeherrschter charakter der sich nicht im griff hat und damit sich und der mannschaft keinen gefallen tut
7914834 das gibt es nicht dass ein mann wie er der torj ger war der kopfballstark ist und links wie rechts schie t keinen mehr rein bringt
7914835 er befindet sich noch im aufbau und man muss ihm einfach zeit geben
7914836 we are very pleased that utstarcom continues to use our award winning products to succeed in the global marketplace this deal demonstrates the versatility of our input products and the opportunity we have as a company to tap into other similar markets
7914837 there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty that accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over educate ourselves in the wild struggle for existence we want to have something that endures and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts in the silly hope of keeping our place the thoroughly well informed man that is the modern ideal and the mind of a thoroughly well informed man is a dreadful thing it is like a bric a brac shop all monsters and dust and everything priced above its proper value
7914838 its a real gift to be able to get things from one place to another in the right order
7914839 and if i dont play ill be ready for kansas city
7914840 yeah i sure do ive been playing a lot of football so whether you play or dont play in the preseason id be ready no matter what its up to coach i was hoping i could play last week
7914841 speak to one another with psalms hymns and spiritual songs sing and make music in your hearts to the lord always giving thanks to god the father for everything in the name of our lord jesus christ
7914842 dunny is a local lad and everyone looks up to him i gave him the responsibility of being vice captain and he has taken it on board
7914843 if any player performs well whether it is dunny or anyone else then we will look to see if we can extend their contract
7914844 im very happy and very relieved it ended up like this because this was the best solution it was very good that we kept calm its been worth the wait
7914845 i met david moyes and the players everton are a big club and its a fantastic opportunity for me which i couldnt say no to
7914846 im satisfied with the one year deal and we have the possibility to look at another one
7914847 i believe we have a strong squad and i believe in the players i have instead of always looking at who might be coming in
7914848 it is not one player who makes a difference it is up to us as team to show personality strength and belief within the squad
7914849 we just look at the right player and if we can get him we get him if we dont we dont
7914850 if nothing is done it will not limit our ambitions because of it
7914851 the names do not impress me what is impressive for me is the attitude the quality
7914852 there is only one thing important and that is what you do on the pitch
7914853 its all gone quickly but if a team from the premier league want you you should not doubt yourself
7914854 scouts of fulham have seen me in action with the dutch under 17 team in a tournament in spain
7914855 after the game against czech republic i think fulham have contacted my agent
7914856 the first week i trained at the academy in london then we departed to germany for three friendly matches that was very nice with four goals and four assists
7914857 im glad that everything is completed before the start of the youth competitions in england
7914858 these are the initial pick ups but there are a number of other pilots we feel will also get the go ahead in some form moving forward
7914859 i was blown away to find out when i first met him that he had this heavy west london accent and was in a band
7914860 i downloaded the whole thing really punk but hell sing his punk songs and do a beautiful a cappella section at the end
7914861 we have to get inside we have a babysitter at home

7914866 ive never had the dynamic of working with people my age before everyones friends i mean some of us have been lucky to have good keepers and some of us like me have been stuck with really bad boyfriends

7914898 my constituents have grave concerns about the expansion of the plum island facility and i believe it is critical that the department of homeland security gets the message
7914899 well defend the sound from the plum island project just as we defended it from broadwater
7914900 we are gravely concerned that you have ignored the possibility of widespread transmission of diseases both regionally and internationally which have no known vaccine or therapy
7914901 as co chairs of connecticuts long island sound liquefied natural gas task force we learned that a draft eis is not always a totally neutral investigative document
7914902 we urge you to remove the plum island animal disease center from the list of potential sites for the new bsl 4 national bio and agro defense facility

7914906 now that the viewing figures are lower on the tv everywhere i go someone will come up to me and say what a huge fan they are that just tells me that people watch the show in a more modern way and that it has reached its sort of critical mass

7914911 it was not at all my intention to put nuns on the catwalk
7914912 it was interpreted as more of a physical thing now no one is saying that nuns cant be beautiful but i was thinking about something more complete
7914913 we have to draw more attention to the world of nuns who are often not sufficiently appreciated by society

7915001 the capture of the speakers chair by the mdc levelled the ground effectively achieving a power sharing structure in the legislature outside the negotiations

7915423 i think everyone is a bit nervous at the moment about what the economy is going to do
7915424 if my friends and family are nervous its natural sponsors are going to be too
7915425 its never been easy getting half a million dollars out of a sponsor quite a lot of work has to go into it
7915426 we work quite hard harder than a lot of teams to keep our sponsors happy
7915427 as a sport were doing well enough its always been hard
7915428 they companies spend their dollars more wisely than they did 15 years ago
7915429 ive always said that damien is not only the best rider in australia but hes also world class
7915430 there may be equals out there around the world but there is none better
7915431 that is one of the things that makes a great jockey
7915432 you are there assisting the horse not hampering the horse
7915433 this guy has the unique ability to be able to pass that on to his horse and especially especially under pressure
7915434 thats where this boy counts he doesnt get beaten in too many photos and you will note that hes not using the whip a great deal
7915435 hes reverting to the experience hes had against riding against some of the best riders in the world and hes brought that back here and adopted that european type style
7915436 that exactly backed up what ive thought hes as good as anyone in the world
7915437 its such a great honour for it to happen at such a relatively young age and recognition for a lot of hard work over 20 years
7915438 it was pretty tough leaving home as a 16 year old and coming to melbourne and not really knowing anyone
7915439 the freedmans gave me a great opportunity but there were some tough times i always thought if it wasnt a success i could go back to perth
7915440 i certainly never thought i would achieve what i have the more success i had the more i enjoyed it and melbourne has become home to me
7915441 its a special feeling to be on the same stage as my father
7915442 i hope there wont be a fence here too long
7915443 money is important in life it does not give you happiness we all know but it sure calms the nerves
7915444 we have gone down the environmental path and this is a perfect fit for us and visy
7915445 this gives our relationship some real substance and this is something they are the forefront of so we can push their message to the community and the kids
7915446 richard pratt has made a big commitment to the club and been a fantastic person this is just another contribution to the club and its terrific
7915447 everyone is claiming to have the best facilities but it puts us on a par with the best facilities in australia
7915448 we have only just received the news so we are not in a position to comment around any of the detail we havent considered our response yet
7915449 i think at the moment we dont need to talk about it
7915450 were all aware we have an opportunity to do it were confident that if we play well we can get some wins its important this week going away to a really tough ground that we perform well there
7915451 it would have been a nice way for him to finish off they would have used it as motivation but i think theyve got another reason now to play well i think that will lift them
7915452 the minor premiership as ive said before its a really good scalp to have on your belt
7915453 wed be proud to hold that again but again weve still got two games to go we could still finish second or third
7915454 were just going to concern ourselves with newcastle now and go from there
7915455 the real depth of quality at present i believe is in melbourne
7915456 those horses weekend hussler light fantastic are extremely good horses and theyll be extremely hard to beat through the spring
7915457 the melbourne cup is the target one target the cup hopefully well achieve it
7915458 people forget she ran group 1 placings at two she can sprint i couldnt be happier with her shell give them something to think about
7915459 shes a machine you watch her on tv and you think shes a big lanky rubbery sort of mare but shes got amazing size a great shoulder she felt fantastic
7915460 i want to win another championship and if that means i have to bide my time and sit on the bench and watch the boys do well then thats it
7915461 but i know my qualities and everyone knows my qualities and im glad the boys are doing well with a good start to the season
7915462 this is my first session in about three weeks and it felt quite good out there there was a slight bit of pain there but im sure it will pull up for friday
7915463 weve recruited well got a lot more depth more challenging for positions and its exciting times for melbourne victory
7915464 its a tough tournament to win rafa has never been beyond the quarters so thats definitely the advantage i carry to the other players
7915465 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s open
7915466 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time being no 1 so it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and hes played so well on all surfaces now
7915467 maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having no 1 next to me and it should be interesting
7915468 it is important that when the club has done something good for you you do something good for the club
7915469 the reason i left bayern is because i didnt get the minutes i wish i had
7915470 the lads here give me the confidence to believe that my body is 100 okay and to play as well as i used to
7915471 now im very relaxed and confident that this season can be as good as the last one especially because i feel good in training
7915472 for me it was always clear before signing the deal i had three years to go with blackburn so the club were the ones deciding what happens with my future
7915473 they understand that im very ambitious but what they offer is the chance for me to become a better player
7915474 we have watched as many of you experienced physical and other 3d discomforts
7915475 rovers will not be pursuing an interest in bolton goalkeeper ali al habsi
7915476 if he thought william was the best captain for the club then he is the man to call it
7915477 i am not really there a lot of people throw stones but i am not prepared to do that because i dont know the situation
7915478 he thinks he is the best captain for the club and i am not going to argue with his record
7915479 they need a bit of experience a couple of players
7915480 he believes in his squad and the talent he has got there i just think you need a couple more winners who have been there seen it and done it
7915481 for me they made a big error and the big mistake was not keeping on sol and ashley a little bit longer
7915482 i know they had the situation if you speak to arsene ashley wanted to go and whatever but i would have got them in my office and handcuffed them even though they werent performing
7915483 it was just for the transition all the kids come in and all the kids are there together everyone retired together the back four retired pretty much together patrick went dennis bergkamp all the people who knew the club inside out and knew how to be winners knew what to do
7915484 all the kids they are tremendously talented probably technically better than he has ever had it is the most technical squad he has ever had but they need to learn to become winners there is no one really who has made the transition

7915497 he had a wide run and an awkward ride nothing against steven king its just the way it turned out steven said if he draws in the horse finishes a lot closer
7915498 he finished a length behind weekend hussler and had no luck and hes improved he worked great this morning you work it out
7915499 he ran good he had to come out wide and lost ground hes definitely improved a fair bit on that run there are a lot of positives

7915510 its a lot like fishing you just catch them on their way to somewhere
7915511 theyve been around for seven or eight years touring the u s europe and everywhere theyre a big festival act
7915512 it was just a fluke that they happened to have easter sunday off and we brought them in and it turned out to be a good show for them
7915513 over the years of doing things at the boathouse a lot of booking agents keep track of who plays where and if a place has had acts that have the same kind of draw the same kind of style as the acts theyre trying to book they know theres a good audience there
7915514 we get calls from a lot of people who say weve been offered a gig at the intersection in grand rapids but we wanna play the boathouse it shows that artists feel theyre going to be treated and promoted well sometimes theyll take a smaller more intimate club over a larger one if they know its going to be run properly
7915515 the unique thing about where were at in saugatuck is its a new market for a lot of up and coming artists its a place they havent played and its an opportunity to develop a new fan base
7915516 were happy to be able to bring to the community acts that youd otherwise have to sit in the car for three hours to see
7915517 we get requests for acts we wouldnt be able to handle but just to know that were getting that kind of attention here and maybe move some of that into other venues would be ideal
7915518 deke is a great guitar player a great musician but he really gets his roots from traditional music rockabilly bluegrass and surf music like the ventures he plays mostly casinos so the boathouse is a little bit of a different scene but it works

7915556 the november election is going to be wonderful once the democratic convention is out of the way by thursday there will be a major shift of supporters from hillary clinton to that of barack obama
7915557 a lot of supporters of clinton have not yet made up their minds i noticed in news this morning that only 46 per cent of them so far are completely dedicated to obama and i think after this convention youll see a massive move by them to support obama and the polls will change very quickly
7915558 i think this is working out quite well i know this from history in 1976 when i got the nomination for president there was an intense argument between gerald ford and ronald reagan at their republican convention and they were divided horribly
7915559 bill clinton and his wife will be completely committed to obama i dont have any doubt about that

7915565 the performances are on the whole good though other parts of the production left me wondering not sure exactly what the message is re the race politics of the play instead of othello being a black man among whites here he is a dark filipino among pinoys less dark the casting of rody vera and ron capinding who i didnt get to see as iago is curious they arent at all fair or mestizo theyre nearly as malay looking as nonie buencamino i dont know what teroy guzman who alternates looks like in person but im guessing he doesnt look very different instead of the white villain black victim dynamic of the text we get im not sure what exactly moreover the casting of the other roles doesnt fit neatly into a fair vs dark dichotomy without this the racial overtones of the play arent as strong as they could be and if they arent then its harder to understand othellos gullibility and nonie buencaminos performance is powerful stuff

7915605 oh theres a bitten in half snake in a pile of puke and blood all over the floor
7915606 we dont exclude octogenarians from icd therapy nor does medicare exclude coverage but it remains to be proven at the highest level of clinical evidence that the very elderly have a meaningful extension of life with defibrillators
7915607 the establishment of primary prevention indications has produced a rapid rise in icd implantations within the elderly community and there is every indication that cardiac resynchronization crt and af ablation therapies will follow this path
7915608 which has tended conceptually toward unlimited care for the most people
7915609 the primary prevention icd is almost a us genre of one this is a discussion that wouldnt even take place in most other western countries
7915610 in many parts of the world an 80 year old who needs a pacemaker not only wont be offered an icd theyll probably get a single chamber pacemaker
7915611 there is a limit on the number of icds we can implant so what happens is that our colleagues in the community who refer patients for icds tend not to refer those who are very elderly we just dont see many of those patients
7915612 but i suspect it happens a lot less frequently than it does south of the border
7915613 create a unique point of service dilemma for the physician who has made a commitment to hardware at least in the form of bradycardia support but the patient additionally seems to qualify on paper for an icd
7915614 i dont have a statistic for how often thats happening except we all know its happening
7915615 theres been an understandable but unsupported extrapolation of observations of benefit made in younger patients to patients on average 20 years older for which we really dont have any strong scientific support
7915616 it is possible that sinus node dysfunction betrays a more susceptible patient substrate one that might derive greater benefit from icd therapy alternatively or additively it is possible that sinus node dysfunction implies greater frailty possibly attributable to unmeasured comorbidity which could render icd therapy less valuable
7915617 theres no question that the underlying risk of these patients is usually higher their risk of complications is usually higher and their preferences are much more varied than in the younger population
7915618 even if we assume that they get the same benefit from icds that was seen in the trials their entire scenario is different were in an era when were in great need of some thoughtful discussion about how best to approach these patients
7915619 on average patients enrolled in most were nearly 15 years older than patients in the sudden cardiac death heart failure trial scd heft
7915620 patients who presented with snd had ejection fractions ef lt lt u gt 35 and were treated with permanent pacemakers had a 10 fold increased risk of hf death and a fourfold increased risk of scd sudden cardiac death compared with patients who had a normal ef
7915621 only slightly higher than the 2 6 annualized scd rate in the non icd treatment arm of scd heft
7915622 the annualized all cause mortality rate 13 1 however was nearly double that of non icd patients in scd heft 7 0
7915623 whether the use of icds or cardiac resynchronization therapy to provide appropriate bradycardia support would prolong life among very elderly pacemaker patients with ef lt lt u gt 35 should remain an open line of scientific inquiry
7915624 there are older patients who may have a good expectation for survival with an appropriately indicated defibrillator and there are younger patients who because of comorbidities and other issues may actually have a poorer expectation for survival
7915625 one shouldnt make decisions to limit the utilization of icds on the basis of age alone without a broader consideration of those other things
7915626 but that is generally true for elderly patients with almost any therapy they are underrepresented in trials because they frequently have comorbidities that would limit their inclusion in trials but they are usually not excluded directly because of age
7915627 much of the data from which guidelines are generated dont apply to the particular patient in front of us
7915628 is entirely justifiable at any age but the idea of addressing a theoretical risk of a sudden death sometime in the future is a very murky benefit and it gets murkier as the patient gets older
7915629 we are perhaps too generous with therapies that are not likely to provide benefit as a general course this may be particularly true in older patients who have other conditions that were not taking into account when we look at any therapy that affects life expectancy but does not affect quality of life we have to be very careful that we use that therapy in patients who are expected to have a good quality of life
7915630 as we look at the healthcare problem in the us were going to have to make some exceedingly difficult decisions were going to have to be either rational or be severely rationed and a relatively easy target is to reduce the number of expensive procedures that do not provide anticipated benefit
7915631 has the patient been hospitalized more than once for heart failure in the last year does the patient have an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 ml min if the answers to those questions are yes the chances are small the patient will benefit from an icd
7915632 not all patients want to live forever in fact many of them if theyre going to die of something would prefer to die quickly and painlessly than to die slowly in the hospital thats an important consideration that some physicians dont necessarily discuss with their patients in enough detail
7915633 pacing leads are much more reliable than defibrillator leads historically
7915634 the odds of these things happening are small but if the benefit is small then all it takes is a small extra risk to even things out the point is that defibrillators are not innocuous devices
7915635 for some patients an icd to reduce a hypothetical risk of sudden death while it merely delivers bradycardia support might not be worth the morbidity that comes with it
7915636 has not placed age limits on icd therapies and many clinicians have apparently not considered whether icd therapy is less likely to be lifesaving in the very elderly
7915637 until future clinical trials can specifically address the indications for icd therapy in elderly pacemaker patients
7915638 they would not necessarily be easy trials to do but i think frankly they are clinical trials were going to have to face in order to rationalize these resources i think we need to know whether the average 85 year old lives longer with a defibrillator or not on a primary prevention basis
7915639 i dont believe its necessary to do another clinical trial rather we should use the data that we already have in hand and apply some common sense in patient selection
7915640 it wont take long to see how long their lives are lengthened in a meaningful way we wont need a randomized trial to do that
7915641 the responsible thing for us to do is to track the results of the therapies were already giving people

7915662 ive been here 10 years and i recruited against alabama for 10 years and never had a problem with alabama or auburn either one thats why i was kind of surprised such a big thing was made
7915663 vic coached at troy and has friends in the state i have friends in the state have never had a problem with either school and a guy makes an off the cuff comment and i know were really looking for things to write about talk about on the internet and talk shows
7915664 for a school if we had some bad blood in the past but heres a school thats had zero bad blood and have recruited that state actively thats why i was kind of surprised it snowballed and got to the level it did
7915665 i didnt say anything to him i think he stated that he was kidding we didnt recruit him julio jones that shows you how i think what kind of insignificant statement it is
7915666 i said hello to him i said well i guess ill be seeing you at the end of august and then he got out and got in his escalade and drove off thats serious and then i went over and watched burton scott at vigor high school at the track over there and burton scott was running around he went and got in his escalade out at track practice and drove off so im familiar with those two guys
7915667 if there is a legitimate trademark infringement claim it needs to be settled in a court of law if the creator of tris isnt interested in doing that then im not sure i see a problem with it being removed i understand that argument that hes a college student he cant afford a lawyer and i get that but thats the system that we have i would imagine from his point of view its just not worth the hassle and i would have to agree with that if i was in his situation
7915668 im ida may and theres one thing i know fourth grade isnt fourth at all fourth means youve done something at least three times before but fourth grade is nothing like third grade or second grade or first grade in fourth grade there is no more printing there is only cursive i hate cursive in fourth grade you are not allowed to add and subtract you are only allowed to multiply and divide in fourth grade youre a baby if you still want to play with barbies or if the tooth fairy still comes to your house or if you want your mother to walk you to the bus stop third grade is the last grade you can get by with any of that trust me

7915698 something is really dirty here everything about the governments story smells
7915699 whatever happened to this woman is terrible and its incumbent on us to find out what it was
7915700 as the department of justice has made clear ms siddiqui was not in u s custody before she was detained on july 17 2008
7915701 any suggestion that the cia would imprison her children is wrong and offensive had we known where ms siddiqui was prior to her capture we would have shared that information with our partners in this country and overseas she was a fugitive from american justice
7915702 we kept the boy for 24 hours because we do not have a right to hold him longer than that
7915703 we sent him to the national security directorate and i dont know what happened to the boy after that
7915704 he is an orphan and that his parents were killed in an earthquake in pakistan around october 2005
7915705 the child is an american citizen he is not a pakistani citizen
7915706 we are left to figure out the rest for ourselves

7915725 his behavior is outrageous what is the rest of the non jw family going to think when they find out about this story
7915726 im so glad you picked up one of those copies you know i was going to read that out loud but their preacher said he wouldnt do the service if one of the family got up and said something you cant blame mom he practically held her hostage i have no idea what were going to do when something happens to her those people are so difficult and they really took advantage of our grief to push their own religious agenda
7915727 hopefully what were talking about is something that will not happen

7915731 theres an amount of risk involved in leases where we see the used car market were a little more exposed we certainly remain committed to leasing but we are trying to shift
7915732 there are always going to be people who need to lease
7915733 they might not be as aggressive and payments may go up a little bit but its such a main part of the selling strategy for i dont see how they could abandon leasing and expect to do any volumes
7915734 we almost see leasing as a crm customer relationship management tool having a customer coming back on a regular basis the way we work the whole process from the new car to the relationship during the lease to the used car
7915735 ford and chrysler are pretty much getting out of the leasing business gm is still in it and leasing is still available for luxury and midline imports
7915736 particularly on the heavier vehicles theres been such a drop in theyre being proactive to get people out of them now rather than wait 15 or 18 months from now
7915737 maybe folks were used to going out and leasing for x number of dollars per month and getting something that was more expensive than they would normally buy they can still get in for x per month but its going to be on a five or six year loan instead of a three year lease

7915788 we have developed a method that enables us to visualise fingerprints even after the print itself has been removed
7915789 for the first time we can get prints from people who handled a cartridge before it was fired wiping it down washing it in hot soapy water makes no difference and the heat of the shot helps the process we use
7915790 the procedure works by applying an electric charge to a metal say a gun or bullet which has been coated in a fine conducting powder similar to that used in photocopiers
7915791 even if the fingerprint has been washed off it leaves a slight corrosion on the metal and this attracts the powder when the charge is applied so showing up a residual fingerprint
7915792 the technique works on everything from bullet casings to machine guns even if heat vaporises normal clues police will be able to prove who handled a particular gun

7916037 the capture of the speakers chair by the mdc levelled the ground effectively achieving a power sharing structure in the legislature outside the negotiations

7916098 i ask basic questions what are you going to do in the shoe
7916099 we can check the wear patterns to see if that shoe is correct for you
7916100 some people want one shoe for everything and thats just not possible today
7916101 dont wear a running shoe for volleyball running is a straight forward activity volleyball is back and forth running shoes dont have any lateral support so youll roll an ankle
7916102 that helps transition as you pull your toe up and makes the transition smoother since you dont leave the ground

7916138 i told him there would come a time when those wronged would ask for restitution i never thought you could actually pay in flesh from the buttocks region i thought he made that one up
7916139 we think it was a marionette show when he was perhaps six years old a little horse puppet called him fat can you imagine an explanation of what actually precipitated his later behavior would be pure speculation

7916153 it is our position that the recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia does not conform to international law
7916154 georgias independence and territorial integrity cannot be changed by decree from moscow
7916155 its a unilateral decision that doesnt have international support that makes it legally binding
7916156 unconditional support for georgias territorial integrity and respect for the borders of the country
7916157 an attack on the independence sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia
7916158 this is an unconcealed annexation of these territories which are a part of georgia
7916159 we use the same arguments as those used by the west with regard to kosovo all other possible means were exhausted there was no possible way to reconcile with georgia this is purely a continuation of the kosovo precedent

7916209 my brothers what good is it to profess faith without practicing it
7916210 black theology cannot accept a view of god which does not represent god as being for oppressed blacks and thus against white oppressors living in a world of white oppressors blacks have no time for a neutral god the brutalities are too great and the pain too severe and this means we must know where god is and what god is doing in the revolution there is no use for a god who loves white oppressors the same as oppressed blacks we have had too much of white love the love that tells blacks to turn the other cheek and go the second mile what we need is the divine love as expressed in black power which is the power of blacks to destroy their oppressors here and now by any means at their disposal unless god is participating in this holy activity we must reject gods love
7916211 life is good when you are good so be nice and youll be happy
7916212 therefore we do not lose heart though outwardly we are wasting away yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day for our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all so we fix our eyes not on what is seen but on what is unseen for what is seen is temporary but what is unseen is eternal

7916217 there is much that we can learn from joel osteen not that we need to imitate him but his ability to connect with people and communicate genuine caring is something more preachers should work on and pray about
7916218 joel isnt for everybody but if you find him helpful and encouraging go for it but please use joel to supplement your spiritual growth dont make joel the primary source of your spiritual growth
7916219 im trying to figure out if thats a compliment or a criticism
7916220 4 my big issue with joel is that he never mentions the cross of jesus or the fact that jesus suffered and died for our sins and then rose from the dead to offer us eternal life
7916221 there was a strong suspicion that it came from that particular maple leaf foods product that we had on hand
7916222 that had left a small group of staff to effectively be operating the program and we decided in our best interests to shut down the camp a few days early
7916223 our inspectors have gone and done a regular inspection that they would do when an outbreak is notified which is looking at the food handling practices
7916224 weve scored three offensive touchdowns in 10 quarters and we need to move to a situation where we have a more mobile quarterback
7916225 my mom will tell you to put a string on the ceiling fan and have your child jump for it
7916226 she had a fan and then connected a string with a foam soccer ball to one of the strings she made me jump for it every morning and try to head it once i got it she would raise the string
7916227 its more me wanting to get a head on it and basically having confidence going after a header
7916228 shes big strong and physical but there are a lot of players like that who are not necessarily great in the air
7916229 for me it was really hard going from the person the team looks to to being a person who is almost nonexistent
7916230 that as well as not playing was a difficult adjustment for me
7916231 i couldnt fall asleep one night so i wrote an e mail to all my teammates telling them that they will never realize how big and how important being a hawkeye is until their senior season
7916232 my goal is to help people realize that this year i need to do everything i can to work hard and win
7916233 seeing the improvement has been one of the most rewarding things ive gotten out of coming to iowa
7916234 to go to a program that isnt on top but is getting there and getting close that in itself is rewarding
7916235 kelsey has been a rock for us in the middle of the field
7916236 she does some things as good as anyone in the big ten shes excellent at winning balls and other coaches are asking their team to mark her up on corner kicks she is still able to win balls score goals or get assists thats a special attribute
7916237 eventually i joined a club team that had a pretty good reputation and a great coach who helped me identify what i was looking for in a college
7916238 i came to iowa particularly because it was out of state
7916239 i wanted that change and leaving their home state is something a lot of kids dont get the opportunity to do when i first came i absolutely loved the girls on the team and i loved the campus i thought this was a great area and a beautiful location throw all those things together and thats why i chose iowa
7916240 at one point the entire team just sat there looking at each other we were speechless
7916241 we dont have a ton of seniors but were excited about the ones we have
7916242 kelsey is somebody who will produce on the field now well ask her to do some more speaking to the team about what it takes to be successful
7916243 i would really like to go out of the country for awhile and study or work abroad
7916244 i like to experience new cultures and i would like to experience as much as i can now before i have a family

7916265 you can only have certainty about a fixed election date in the context of a majority government
7916266 look if any of the opposition parties wanted to provide some any degree of certainty that well be here to october 2009 then well have an election in october 2009
7916267 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic certainty

7916316 the downside risk to growth poses a downside risk to inflation at the two year horizon
7916317 ive tried very hard for the last five years to get people used to the idea that there will be movements of inflation both up and below the target
7916318 it has been very much ebb and flow and the mood here is very much one of financial caution as regards the next year we have our fingers crossed but there is the recognition there is still quite a long way to go yet
7916319 last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by the time of christmas but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7916320 on the assumption commodity prices remain stable and if anything fall back then inflation should drop back as we go through next year
7916321 we live in an environment which is characterised by a very high degree of volatility and it is very difficult to predict whether this decline in oil prices is going to continue or it will reverse if we get a new geopolitical tension or a new hurricane or other events which you cannot predict

7916364 australia would lose valuable export earners jobs and investment will be lost
7916365 i might also add that a number of these industries are located in regional centres where the opportunities for alternative employment will be limited and the effect on working families could be devastating

7916377 the race is on there are just 1 431 days to go many major stakeholders already support this ambitious goal including the mayor of london
7916378 the government will announce a new rough sleeping strategy in the autumn and we want to see this scale of ambition included
7916379 we call on the government local authorities the mayor of london other city leaders and politicians of all parties to work together with the third sector to achieve this ambitious and realistic goal over the next four years
7916380 these figures show the shadow of repossession is no longer just cast over homeowners but also thousands of innocent renters who have no idea how close they are to eviction
7916381 sadly the impact of repossession can be even greater for tenants who despite paying rent on time can find themselves with very few rights and the first they even know about it is when the bailiffs start banging on the door
7916382 mortgage lenders must take responsibility and make sure they inform both owners and tenants when taking action to repossess so tenants are aware they are about to lose their home
7916383 the government must step in now to protect people who may find themselves homeless because their landlord is being repossessed by making sure courts treat tenants fairly and give them enough time to find a new home

7916593 restrict the presidents authority to protect americans effectively from terrorist attack and bring terrorists to justice
7916594 t he order does nothing to repudiate earlier interpretations of the bush administration which narrowed tortures scope to allow coercive interrogation techniques including sleep deprivation water boarding and extraordinary rendition among others instead of proscribing torture it adds yet another layer to the legal regime supporting those earlier policies
7916595 t he executive orders most revealing words come at the end its final section states that the order creates no rights enforceable by any victim against the united states or its employees while expressly offering cia employees a defense against any attempt to hold them liable for abuse the ultimate purpose of the law in other words is to protect the potential perpetrators not the potential victims
7916596 willful killing torture or inhuman treatment including biological experiments willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health compelling a prisoner of war to serve in the forces of the hostile power or willfully depriving a prisoner of war of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed in this convention
7916597 the constitutionality of warrantless national security agency wiretaps presidential signing statements and many other controversial aspects of the war on terrorism
7916598 cannot in good conscience defend a decision that we believe has compromised our national honor and that may well promote the commission of war crimes by americans and place at risk the welfare of captured american military forces for generations to come
7916599 interpret common article 3 with respect to a controversial cia interrogation program
7916600 policymakers should also keep in mind that violations of common article 3 are war crimes for which everyone involved potentially up to and including the president of the united states may be tried in any of the other 193 countries that are parties to the conventions

7916602 a president besieged and isolated yet at ease bush grasping for answers and fixated on iraq remains resolute
7916603 at the nadir of his presidency george w bush is looking for answers
7916604 one at a time or in small groups he summons leading authors historians philosophers and theologians to the white house to join him in the search
7916605 he remains unflinching rarely expressing doubt in his direction yet trying to understand how he got off course
7916606 you dont get any feeling of somebody crouching down in the bunker
7916607 this is either extraordinary self confidence or out of touch with reality i cant tell you which
7916608 my god he looked well he looked like he came off a cruise in the caribbean he looked like he hadnt a care in the world it was amazing
7916609 bush has virtually given up on winning converts while in office and instead is counting on vindication after he is dead
7916610 lets step back from the unnecessary mistakes and the self inflicted wounds that have characterized the bush administration
7916611 lets look at the broad forest rather than the often unlovely trees what do we see
7916612 most important a war in iraq that has been very difficult but where we now seem to be on course to a successful outcome
7916613 i now think we can with the new counterinsurgency strategy backed up by the troop surge i think the odds are finally better than 50 50 that we will prevail
7916614 w e can remove saddam because that could start a chain reaction in the arab world that would be very healthy

7916616 v ery few wars in american history were prepared better or more thoroughly than this one by this president

7916618 in reading the individual character of leaders he is reading the tablet that really matters
7916619 h istory is driven by the club of those in power
7916620 p olitical leaders can only play a tiny role in transforming a people especially when the integral fabric of a society has dissolved
7916621 if bushs theory of history is correct the right security plan can lead to safety but if tolstoy is right then the future of iraq is beyond the reach of global summits political benchmarks and the understanding of any chief executive

7916624 p rison conditions at abu ghraib have improved markedly and dramatically since the arrival of coalition troops in baghdad
7916625 could undertake to defend against any member of human rights watch or amnesty international and know in advance that none of them could challenge it let alone negate it
7916626 before march 2003 abu ghraib was an abattoir a torture chamber and a concentration camp
7916627 now and not without reason it is an international byword for yankee imperialism and sadism yet the improvement is still unarguably the difference between night and day
7916628 photographs have laid down the tracks of how important conflicts are judged and remembered photographs have an insuperable power to determine what we recall of events and it now seems probable that the defining association of people everywhere with the war that the united states launched pre emptively in iraq last year will be photographs of the torture of iraqi prisoners by americans in the most infamous of saddam husseins prisons abu ghraib

7916696 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7916697 to everyone who is saying hillary 2012 or hillary 2016 yes i am thinking of running again but if you ruin the election for barack obama this time around i will not be able to garner the needed votes next time because people will be too angry at me they had 18 million votes too and i cant afford to lose those votes because my supporters were too divisive this time around this is a simple fact people will remember we need unity now not revenge by hurting obama for me this time around youre just hurting yourselves in the future and youll be killing whatever chance i have at ultimately becoming president
7916698 i am sorry i got carried away with my own personal ambitions and let that lead me down a path of regrets the negative things i said about sen obama were purely political and should have never been said under any circumstance

7916714 the music is guitar based rock just the way a rock band should be the album features sounds from the 80s hammond style organs and a bit of rob zombie style as well all the experiences weve had and people weve met touring the world during the last few years have had their influences on the album
7916715 as for the rest of the world we are currently negotiating the release in several different territories so expect an update soon
7916716 im a fan of different sorts of music and i think its most fun when a band puts out an album that has elements of everything you get this thing called diversity not boredom thats what were trying to do still i think people are going to be surprised how brutal this album is
7916717 first i go by the one drop rule one drop of black blood and youre black the truth is every african american is bi racial go back far enough and youll find the massah was in the slave quarters
7916718 we have a lot of blackberries right now it will help those
7916719 and the sweet potatoes it will put some size on them those will be harvested in september
7916720 this is the first step to getting out of the drought situation we are in
7916721 the young ones are too impatient to climb up the ladder looking at promotions as rewards if only they knew what a promotion entails and how much it takes away versus how much it gives
7916722 well i am sure our bosses also felt the same of us when we came out of uni and were driven to prove our worth and well pay off those student loans
7916723 you know those times of actually staying up late at night to marry data from one data source that tracks the exact time of airing of a 15s ad to another data source that contains the exact ratings at that point in time
7916724 but do you also notice that the rigor has been gone
7916725 back then we had to conduct not just analyses of the programs but we made projections on how programs and breaks are going to be like we had to create reach curves across different scenarios and mixes of buys and predict how certain mixes can result to some probable reach it wasnt just the last 13 weeks or last 20 weeks it was the last 26 weeks and similar period and we would determine if they were statistically different or not and if they were why these days we just see media plans with ratings in them
7916726 if you delivered 50 more grps than what you planned then that means you wasted money since you didnt need that extra 50 you couldve used that elsewhere perhaps in another medium another week another i dont know events
7916727 these days post buys are simply a reportage of what happened theres nothing in there that makes it relevant to the business and the future campaigns it just a piece of paper a report what a pity
7916728 but you see things are changing too post buy tempates of tv are probably not applicable to post buys on digital
7916729 all i have seen so far are fancy charts with lines and curves and percentages and ratios
7916730 it is still on the table as a possibility but we are looking a lot of different things
7916731 the government has got to be seen to be helping ordinary people in these difficult economic times the price of oil is going up and therefore fuel prices are going up
7916732 my own view on the prospect of a windfall tax on energy companies is that the government will be cautious about introducing something which has an implicit retrospective element to it
7916733 im sure there will be a change of policy this autumn what the detail is of that change will determine the level of my enthusiasm for remaining
7916734 a legalised raid on the companys bank accounts that would be very unhelpful because it would scare off investors and also could make the cost of investment much higher and in the end that would end up on the customers bills
7916735 every 1m you take out of each company through this legalised raid is 1m they have to raise elsewhere

7916759 begrundelsen for at finansudvalget g r ind i s dan en sag er i h j grad for at sikre stabiliteten i det finansielle system samtidig skal vi ind og kigge p om de regler vi har skal strammes op for at undg en lignende situation i fremtiden
7916760 vi afventer en samlet redeg relse og vurdering af forl bet og s m vi selvf lgelig kigge p om det regels t vi har omkring den finansielle sektor er godt nok og hvis der er ting der skal ndres s er vi bne over for det men jeg tror det er tvivlsomt om man kan gardere sig mod d rlig ledelse
7916761 n r der tilg r offentlige midler til en s dan redningsaktion er det interessant f belyst hvad der er kriteriet for anvendelse af disse midler det er klart at det skal vi som finansudvalg v re opm rksomme p alt andet ville v re uansvarligt
7916762 jeg vil ikke udelukke at vi kigger p finanstilsynet jeg mener det er vigtigt at vi f r et helhedsindtryk af hvad der foreg et og s p den baggrund vurdere om reglerne herunder finanstilsynet men ogs alle de her forskellige krav om oplysning til solvens
7916763 omvendt m man sige at investeringsafkastet ikke er nogen stor overraskelse det havde man godt vidst og det er ikke uventet at vi f r en opjustering af forsikringsdelen der ikke kan opveje nedjusteringen i investeringsdelen og at vi dermed f r en samlet nedjustering det har ogs ligget i markedets forventninger generelt
7916764 det skulle ikke undre mig hvis aktien lukker en lille spids h jere og regnskabet er heller ikke noget der ndrer ved min overv gtsanbefaling som jeg ser det er der ikke umiddelbart nogle slemme ting gemt i regnskabet og man ved at topdanmark er det forsikringsselskab der har den mindst konservative investeringsprofil
7916765 vores italienske informationer siger at det rent vejrm ssigt har v ret det d rligste for r i et rhundrede s for i r nedjusterer vi med italien som den vigtigste begrundelse men vi regner ikke med at det forts tter frem mod 2010
7916766 vi k rer p den forsigtige side vi synes ikke at verden er blevet venligere at kigge p vi ser hvordan de tumler rundt i udlandet hvor banker ikke kan klare de tab de f r og derfor skal skal bede aktiemarkedet om ny kapital den situation vil vi meget n dig havne i og derfor l gger stakker vi til lade i jeblikket
7916767 vi g r hvad vi kan og vi har meget fokus p vores kreditkvalitet men det kommer helt an p hvordan afb jningen bliver
7916768 jeg synes der er flere ting man skal holde je med man skal holde je med den internationale konjunkturudvikling man skal holde je med dansk konomi og hvilke signaler politikerne sender og s skal man specielt holde je med ejendomsmarkedet men ogs interbankmarkedet og den slags ting der er 5 10 punkter man skal holde godt je med for at f le sig veltilpas n r man g r i seng og vi f ler os veltilpasse n r vi g r i seng

7916787 nuestra iniciativa pretende ralentizar el cambio clim tico proteger a los ciclistas a los peatones y a los ni os as como reducir la contaminaci n para ello esta medida es razonable
7916788 graphic data has confirmed to us that one of their machines appears to have been inappropriately sold on via a third party
7916789 as a result historical data relating to credit card applications from some of our customers and data from other banks were not removed
7916790 the it equipment that appeared on ebay was neither planned nor instructed by the company to be disposed
7916791 investigations are ongoing to find out how this equipment was removed from a secure location
7916792 this regrettable loss with graphic data as a matter of urgency
7916793 for sure there has been interest from various parties within the gulf there is a precedent in the cases of aston martin ferrari or daimler and those kinds of solutions could be very realistic solutions
7916794 consider all options to ensure that their members rights are protected
7916795 the last thing our union wants to do is strike during the middle of one of the citys most celebrated events
7916796 thousands of harley davidson riders have already begun arriving in milwaukee and the impact they will have on the city is immeasurable to adequately police the waste generated from these visitors our members need to be doing their jobs and be on their trucks but we wont allow the company to strong arm our members the ball is in waste managements court
7916797 we are surprised by the walkout and believe it is unnecessary
7916798 there will be some temporary interruption in service that will largely be restored within the week
7916799 were going to be focusing specifically on harley davidson activities to make sure that those are taken care of
7916800 had been going around their elected representatives and coercing and threatening workers
7916801 we have never broken labor peace and always negotiated in good faith for more than 30 years but now the company is threatening employees and coercing them it is unconscionable
7916802 the science is spot on and all the feedback thats come to me from physicists is positive i think that kate is a little bowled over
7916803 the things that it discovers will rock you in the head
7916804 some more academic people are not too happy and they think it kind of cheapens the science and dumbs it down
7916805 but i think mostly people are excited to have this rap out there and a lot of people at cern just think its great so thats exciting
7916806 we got some strange looks i mean you get a strange look just walking around cern in a lab coat
7916807 she managed to get a couple of afternoons access to the cms and atlas detectors and impressively succeeded in sweet talking a bunch of us into appearing in the video
7916808 by the time we filmed this construction work on the detectors had almost finished in fact if you look past the dancers hard though that is these are some good shots of the detectors at their most impressive just before they were closed off
7916809 there are also a couple of very confused looking engineers in the background
7916810 sadly there havent been as many complimentary comments about the dancing but as my mum told me this weekend thats because the dancing is awful you cant win them all
7916811 katie mcalpine wrote the lyrics and recorded it acapella into her laptop computer while she was working at cern
7916812 i received an mp3 of that vocal recording by email with a request to put some music to it and i put the track together around the vocal which is really the reverse of how songs are usually recorded but was quite an enjoyable challenge
7916813 thinking of programmes like sesame street which often had educational songs i deliberately created a sort of 1980s retro hiphop style for the track
7916814 i added the computer voice as an irreverent nod to mc hawking i then emailed the finished track back to katie and forgot about it all this was in april
7916815 when i was working for the american physical society i wrote this neurochip rap that was just sort of a silly project that i did in the morning writing the rhymes and i just sent it over to my boss james riordon and he was like
7916816 all right we need a video so then once i knew that i could do a rap video even if its terrible and low quality
7916817 basically the problem is sahara is an arctic seal who is afraid of the cold its a bit like being a bird which is scared of heights
7916818 nobody likes the cold but if youre a seal youve got to get used to it pretty fast
7916819 we brought in the ice and at first he wouldnt go near it but something in his memory stirred and he eventually came for a closer inspection
7916820 once hed had a sniff and then slid over the top of it for the first time he found he actually quite likes it
7916821 hopefully the phobia will be cured with a bit of aversion therapy and sahara will be proper ice loving seal again
7916822 he cant stay away from the beach and he keeps swimming in the wrong direction
7916823 now the only reason people have to go outside is if they want to like to play
7916824 its nice to be back home in our neighborhood school
7916825 so far so good the kids seem fine but theyre never the problem
7916826 many people thought it would just be the same as last year
7916827 well get everything ironed out but overall it was a pretty good day

7916829 meine prognose ist schon dass die mehrheit der bundesl nder sich f r gesetze entscheidet die sich an der bergangsregel aus karlsruhe orientieren
7916830 ich kann mir nicht vorstellen dass fl chendeckend ein uneingeschr nktes rauchverbot in s mtlichen gastst tten kommen wird
7916831 ich werde versuchen bei aller heterogenit t m glichst viel einheitlichkeit hinzubekommen
7916832 unser ziel bleibt ein generelles rauchverbot am arbeitsplatz und in den kneipen und gastst tten
7916833 over the next 100 years the shape of our coastline will change and our favourite sea side destinations may not look the way they were captured in our holiday snapshots
7916834 to try and predict what these places will look like in the future we have examined how sea level rise and increased storms will affect all our coastal sites we know where change is most likely to happen and what this change might be
7916835 we need to realise that our environment is not fixed and that change is inevitable society needs to learn to adapt
7916836 im just thrilled i mean its almost emotional weve never seen anything like that
7916837 im absolutely petrified if she was with her family right now shed be in the best place shes not shes with someone that i absolutely do not trust and im absolutely scared that
7916838 that you dont trust yet was babysitting your daughter for a year
7916839 the moment that her phone was cut off and i couldnt get in contact with my daughter
7916840 who did you go to for help first to help try to find her
7916841 we know everything you told us was a lie tell us what happened to caylee
7916842 no i would not have sold my daughter if i wanted to really just get rid of her i wouldve left her with my parents and i wouldve left i wouldve moved out i wouldve given my mom custody
7916843 this precious little angel from above gave me strength and unconditional love jealousy has taken her away jealousy from the one person that should be thankful for all of the love and support given to her
7916844 anthony posted the message while she was apparently watching american psycho a horror movie about a new york executive who is also a serial killer
7916845 shes been lying about a lot of stuff and stole money from her and her grandmother
7916846 i feel like the person were talking about now and the person i knew before are two different people
7916847 unless we start getting the truth were going to announce two possibilities with caylee either you gave caylee to someone that you dont want anyone to find out because you think youre a bad mom or something happened to caylee and caylees buried somewhere or in a trash can somewhere and you had something to do with it either way right now its not a very pretty picture to be painting
7916848 everything youve told us is a lie every single thing
7916849 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled hari puttar
7916850 warner bros values and protects intellectual property rights however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation
7916851 since the case is sub judice we cant comment as of now however we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and its unfortunate that warner has chosen to file a case so close to our films release in my opinion i dont think our title has any similarity or links with harry potter
7916852 a knowing and willful attempt to violate the strictures of federal election law

7916883 in a study of more than 61 000 ethnic chinese living in singapore who were followed for up to 12 years the investigators found a link between heavy incense use and various respiratory cancers the findings are published in the medical journal cancer
7916884 study participants who used incense in their homes all day or throughout the day and night were 80 percent more likely than non users to develop squamous cell carcinoma of the entire respiratory tract the link between incense use and increased cancer risk held when the researchers weighed other factors including cigarette smoking diet and drinking habits
7916885 this association is consistent with a large number of studies identifying carcinogens in incense smoke
7916886 and given the widespread and sometimes involuntary exposure to smoke from burning incense these findings carry significant public health implications
7916887 weve dreamed about adding a shoot the chute ride for years

7916970 so this time we have escalated the penalty to a black screen that reappears every hour until the user validates his or her copy of win xp pro
7916971 mdec respects the rights of companies to protect their intellectual property its a reminder that software piracy doesnt pay especially when malaysians are themselves putting a lot of effort into creating original software
7916972 microsoft has stopped selling win xp in the market so you have to wonder why it is spending time and money to take down users of pirated copies of this os
7916973 why isnt it also targeting users who have pirated copies of windows vista
7916974 so if im using a pirated copy of vista at this time i wont be hassled got to wonder about that
7916975 vista isnt pirated as much wga is continuous and should there be a vista piracy problem we will address it down the road

7916978 listed as a muslim on the registration form for the catholic school
7916979 barack hussein obama was registered under the name barry soetoro serial number 203 and entered the franciscan asisi primary school on 1 january 1968 and sat in class 1b barrys religion was listed as islam
7916980 was registered by his family as a muslim at both schools he attended
7916981 three of his teachers have said he was enrolled as a muslim

7916986 i ask basic questions what are you going to do in the shoe
7916987 we can check the wear patterns to see if that shoe is correct for you
7916988 some people want one shoe for everything and thats just not possible today
7916989 dont wear a running shoe for volleyball running is a straight forward activity volleyball is back and forth running shoes dont have any lateral support so youll roll an ankle
7916990 that helps transition as you pull your toe up and makes the transition smoother since you dont leave the ground
7916991 a true crosstrainer used to be something cut a little higher
7916992 the big thing these days is how the midsole is set up if you have an unstable midsole youre going to roll your ankle

7917046 i think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming

7917065 as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
7917066 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation which is what pelosis ever so informed observations were based on even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
7917067 the blunter words of the great lutheran pastor dietrich bonhoeffer
7917068 the destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder
7917069 i love this keep repeating that you can hear the stiletto sliding across a rib will quickly learn from the historical record that from apostolic times the christian tradition overwhelmingly held that abortion was grievously evil in the absence of modern medical knowledge some of the early fathers held that abortion was homicide others that it was tantamount to homicide and various scholars theorized about when and how the unborn child might be animated or ensouled but none diminished the unique evil of abortion as an attack on life itself and the early church closely associated abortion with infanticide which some candidates apparently dont have a problem with but i digress in short from the beginning the believing christian community held that abortion was always gravely wrong
7917070 we now know with biological certainty exactly when human life begins thus todays religious alibis for abortion and a so called right to choose are nothing more than that alibis that break radically with historic christian and catholic belief
7917071 abortion kills an unborn developing human life it is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it archbp chaput just called pelosis catholics who make excuses for it whether theyre famous or not fool only themselves and archbp chaput just said that she committed the sin of public scandal of those catholics who do sincerely seek to follow the gospel and live their catholic faith
7917072 the duty of the state and its officials is to
7917073 the survey numbers on abortion and gay rights bear the importance of looking beyond denominational affiliation

7917097 we blijven met vechtlust kijken naar acquisitiemogelijkheden als de kans zich voordoet zullen we er bovenop spingen

7917111 we need good weather this week to assure milling wheat quality particularly hagbury falling number scores
7917112 imported milling wheat could offset temporary shortfalls in domestic supplies he said a spokesman acknowledged that wet weather had significantly delayed the countrys milling wheat harvest but denied that key quality characteristics had been damaged so far
7917113 its too early to tell whether the wet weather will reduce quality

7917139 how can god know does the most high have knowledge
7917140 and the are an arrogant people now leave me alone so that my anger may burn against them and that i may destroy them but moses sought the favor of the lord his god
7917141 i will destroy the wisdom of the wise the intelligence of the intelligent i will frustrate
7917142 words of human wisdom is literally wisdom of speech in the greek pauls mission was not to couch the gospel in the language of the trained orator who had studied the techniques of influencing people by persuasive arguments
7917143 among corinthian believers is the very antithesis of the wisdom of god revealed in the cross of christ paul demonstrates the total alienation of thought between the worldly vision so prized by the corinthians and the wisdom of god
7917144 from this new cross has sprung a new philosophy of the christian life and from that new philosophy has come a new evangelical technique a new type of meeting and a new type of preaching
7917145 if i were god and i am loving and merciful i would simply make a decree that man is absolved of his sins
7917146 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways
7917147 as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
7917148 watch and pray for the spirit is willing but the body is weak

7917150 a student is not above his teacher nor a servant above his master
7917151 anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me
7917152 if anyone would come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross daily
7917153 no one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of god
7917154 yeah that person used to say he was a christian but just look at him now
7917155 from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing and forceful men lay hold of it
7917156 they enter the kingdom and become christs disciples to do this takes spiritual courage vigor power and determination because of ever present persecution
7917157 for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god to salvation for everyone who believes for the jew first and also for the greek
7917158 for the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing
7917159 for jews request a sign and greeks seek after wisdom but we preach christ crucified to the jews a stumbling block and to the greeks foolishness vv 22 23
7917160 thats the sign thats the proof that this is the messiah at last
7917161 we dont need some old outdated book like the bible we need some kind of new revelation some sort of deeply spiritual experience
7917162 so you are now new and improved postmodern man why then do you simply repeat the same foolish mistakes of the past
7917163 didnt shy away from the hard truth of the cross but embraced it instead saying in effect im not looking for a popular position from which to proclaim this message or advance it on the back of public favor
7917164 many of us have sung the hymn hes everything to me but what we really meant was that he is a lot maybe even a great deal to us however do we really want him to be everything do i want to lose all claims to friendships all claims to material things all claim to popularity all claim to everything do i really want to know him

7917173 theres a large mythology that we all kind of decided on when we wrote the pilot and we knew that when we went to series we were going to have to reach a certain end point that end points very flexible in terms of when we get there if they let us run for 12 seasons youll see it in season 12 if they take us off the air by nine episodes youll see it in episode nine so um theres a lot of room there

7917192 had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009
7917193 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all

7917211 there definitely is a decline in neckwear especially with the mass market during the last five to 10 years
7917212 mass market silk ties that you find at discount retailers i think thats absolutely the worst place you can go
7917213 you might as well not wear one because it says more negative things about you than positive
7917214 especially if you walk into macys or some of the larger department stores i feel like there is no brand identification or nothing unique
7917215 its like youre walking in to a sea of stripes and plaids and theres nothing thats really grabbing the customer nothing thats exciting
7917216 people dont want to wear a suit they dont want to wear a tie with a jacket
7917217 the younger generations prefer the more casual elegant look without tie or jacket people used to wear ties in the old days but now less and less
7917218 a tie can be the most beautiful part of what a man wears better than the suit better than the shirt

7917221 you put a suit on youre very focused on business and youre there for business
7917222 i just think that thats the way a professional should dress in business
7917223 i think that if youre in dress down mode i dont think you pay as much attention to your business i dont know maybe thats something my father taught me
7917224 but theres something really cool about tying your own bowtie
7917225 there definitely is a decline in neckwear especially with the mass market during the last five to 10 years
7917226 mass market silk ties that you find at discount retailers i think thats absolutely the worst place you can go
7917227 you might as well not wear one because it says more negative things about you than positive
7917228 especially if you walk into macys or some of the larger department stores i feel like there is no brand identification or nothing unique
7917229 its like youre walking in to a sea of stripes and plaids and theres nothing thats really grabbing the customer nothing thats exciting
7917230 people dont want to wear a suit they dont want to wear a tie with a jacket
7917231 the younger generations prefer the more casual elegant look without tie or jacket people used to wear ties in the old days but now less and less
7917232 a tie can be the most beautiful part of what a man wears better than the suit better than the shirt
7917233 if youre in an office and the majority of people arent wearing ties and youre in a tie its really that added confidence boost
7917234 when they have to make a presentation when they have to go on an impressive date when theyre going on an interview they will always select a tie to complete their outfit
7917235 you put a suit on youre very focused on business and youre there for business
7917236 ive been doing a lot of interviews and stage shows
7917237 and half the questions are like will mgs4 be coming out on 360 or other formats
7917238 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7917239 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
7917240 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7917241 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
7917242 there may be parts of the speech that arent going to get a lot of applause but ive got to say what i believe will get out country back on the right path
7917243 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that
7917244 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7917245 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7917246 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7917247 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7917248 to discuss ways in which his foundation is addressing some of the worlds most pressing problems
7917249 president clinton understands this is sen obamas convention and he is here to do all he can to make sen obama our next president
7917250 were talking about the nominee for the president of the united states
7917251 there may be parts of the speech that arent going to get a lot of applause but ive got to say what i believe will get out country back on the right path
7917252 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that
7917253 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7917254 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7917255 our outreach into minority low income and other underserved student groups is yielding tremendous results
7917256 more than ever the sat reflects the face of education in this country
7917257 changes made to the sat did not substantially change how predictive the test is of first year performance
7917258 its designed to reduce stress and alleviate anxiety associated with testing even if the day doesnt go well they can take it again and send the colleges the scores they best feel reflect their abilities
7917259 our outreach into minority low income and other underserved student groups is yielding tremendous results

7917263 most indications are that gustav will be an extremely dangerous hurricane in the northwestern caribbean sea in a few days
7917264 i knew it was coming but i was hoping to be out before it came
7917265 routine base operations will continue through the day as normal assuming conditions warrant this while emergency preparations continue
7917266 the government orders the population to take precautions because this storm will bring a lot of rain
7917267 theres no rain and wind the sky is clear cars are traveling everywhere i dont think theres a hurricane
7917268 but banjo kazooie was developed on the n64 as well but its being put on the 360 if nintendo did have a say about n64 games having an appearance on different platforms why would they say yes to banjo kazooie and no to goldeneye
7917269 this is not an easy choice but this is the only chance to save peoples lives
7917270 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
7917271 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
7917272 but we dont want it and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
7917273 if they want to preserve good relations with russia in the west they will understand the reason behind our decision
7917274 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
7917275 the black sea is just a small pool for their arms with the range of 2 500 kilometers
7917276 georgia chose the least human way to achieve its goal to absorb south ossetia by eliminating a whole nation
7917277 russia is trying to legalize the results of an ethnic cleansing it has conducted to oppose it to the west
7917278 but it will result in russias isolation from the world
7917279 it would have been a nuisance if it had been sunny this past six weeks really a nice cold winter would have done the trick nicely
7917280 the piece has an aggressive nature as the name seizure suggests
7917281 its the idea of a solid mass taking over a space which was once someones home that i find really appealing i suppose that comes from some psychological state of my own thats the only starting place if youre a rationalist though i dont let it keep biting at my ankle like richard dawkins
7917282 im not a scientist im more concerned with starting a natural process which will go on happening by itself its never ending it wont stop whatever you do
7917283 but the youth of athens liked it they liked the way it subverted the whole ancient museum thing and made the city open to living culture instead of only dead
7917284 it appeals to the obsessive compulsive disorder ocd of collectors
7917285 i dont theres a similar piece in los angeles where they didnt even know what dettol was they found the smell most peculiar
7917286 nothing in particular there was no structure it was all very hands off
7917287 restless impatient ive always had a kind of irritability since childhood i mean what does a child growing up in the middle of birmingham want to do he wants to leave as fast as possible
7917288 they thought the building was a bit of an irritation they wanted it to go it was eventually occupied by down and outs squatters and asylum seekers i suppose this project extends its life so its a kind of continuing irritation for a while its tricky but some are very interested
7917289 that makes me sound old fashioned but theres a lot of pop culture in my work too bowie joy division pan sonic sunn o
7917290 that kind of art is all about disclosure its dull dull dull maybe my generation is reacting against that i try to keep myself out of my work seizure is kind of autogenetic growing by itself i prefer to distance myself from ideas of posterity of the longevity of a piece of art none of that seems healthy i dont like explaining and being explicit i dont make art with lots of announcements and whistles and bells
7917291 i love the ambiguity of it all and its secret silent aggressive nature behind those boarded up windows something invasive is happening a mass is colonising the space
7917292 we had been in the air for almost an hour when we heard a loud pop
7917293 the flight attendant came back and told us to remain calm
7917294 thats when we saw the two pilots with the oxygen masks on hearing them breathe like darth vader made it a little harder to stay calm
7917295 landmark agreements have been concluded with every expectation that everyone will sign up
7917296 the elections are now behind us what is upon us is a challenge of vision and common purposes now is the time for us to put zimbabwe first
7917297 the mdc views this continued harassment and arrest of mdc legislators by the state security agents as a direct affront to the will of the people of zimbabwe
7917298 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year
7917299 lets not make too much of the fact that we get a little bounce from month to month
7917300 declines in the present situation index both in terms of business conditions and the labor market appear to be moderating
7917301 the expectations index which posted a significant gain this month suggests better times may be ahead however overall readings are still quite low by historical standards and it is still too early to tell if the worst behind us
7917302 it is anwar versus the entire government god willing i am confident of winning
7917303 it was his home ground so that was always an advantage because he has a lot of support there
7917304 we expected him to win this just proves there is nothing wrong with our electoral system but i still doubt he will be able to pull off his sept 16 threat
7917305 it is a lie to smear him the government is doing everything they can to shame him
7917306 anwars victory will bring good reforms to our country and will unite all the races in malaysia
7917307 are looking at every family and background friend of the suspects and they will continue to do that until they hopefully capture these individuals
7917308 to get tunnel vision on where one suspect might be going we could actually miss the lead on another one
7917309 the videos are spreading like wildfire and becoming something of an urban legend
7917310 the viral marketing campaign been really successful at capturing the attention of all different kinds of users
7917311 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance

7917325 cuando leo un libro nunca pienso en hacer una adaptaci n los compro para disfrutarlos como miro un cuadro o un atardecer pero varias personas me hab an repetido que ten a que llevar al cine esta novela
7917326 pens que efectivamente hab a una adaptaci n y que toda la parte literaria de la novela era asumible si rafael y l consegu an hacer unos personajes poli dricos con profundidad y sustancia interpretados por actores que supiesen demostrar al m ximo las zozobras las inquietudes y la imposibilidad de vivir dignamente
7917327 por decisi n propia es una pel cula sustantiva sin ning n abalorio que empieza con unos t tulos de cr dito en un plano fijo de cinco minutos de un retablo barroco
7917328 la guerra civil tuvo muchas cosas terribles y para m lo m s terrible es que una vez terminada las fuerzas franquistas ya en el poder y sin enemigo armado siguieron matando a miles y miles de personas que no ten an manera ya de defenderse
7917329 if you had a choice between a single person search party or a search team of half a dozen which would you choose
7917330 4 players with local ties i thought logan tom was born and raised here in the islands before moving to utah where she excelled in high school and then to stanford or was it that her dad is from the islands does anyone know
7917331 from the indications we are getting we are very confident of anwars lead
7917332 it is so bad that its very hard for us to determine accurate exit polls due to the large number of people filling the polling centres and the long jams outside
7917333 we dont know whether this is going to be a pattern as we have to continue to monitor the process until polling is closed
7917334 no untoward incidents so far and everything is under control
7917335 only ec secretary kamaruzaman mohd noor can give those details
7917336 but even if i lose its okay as our message has gone down to the voters they are aware of our message
7917337 we are entering parliament with a clear agenda and they bn should wake up with the stark realities of the day
7917338 its not anwar versus the other candidates its anwar versus the entire government machinery
7917339 as you can see the groundswell is great god willing im confident of winning
7917340 i voted at 8 08am as eight is a good number for me
7917341 most thefts of this type can be prevented simply by locking your door and or securing your property
7917342 but the question becomes how long will the hearing proceed the hearing could actually go on for a number of days and i think that really is the issue so really i hesitate to crystal ball or speculate on this i mean there have been so many twists and turns in this saga that ive given up trying to predict i think im just going to let the universe unfold and just be ready for whatever happens when its finally unwrapped
7917343 i have an allergy to mothering brothering and patronizing instincts
7917344 jimmy jimmy jimmy aaja aaja aaja is part of a latest hollywood film called you dont mess with zohan having the terrific actor adam sandler in the lead role
7917345 didi aap yaahan kyun baithi hain make up van mein chaliye
7917346 i was so engrossed in my character that i didnt even realize what i was doing if my make up boy hadnt made me realize that i was sitting beside a dustbin i would have had my snacks there
7917347 i have an allergy to mothering brothering and patronizing instincts
7917348 i know all the lawyers that are in front of me today and your all great lawyers top of the class as they say impeccable reputations so i couldnt believe it could somebody explain it to me why this occurred
7917349 when you see yourself doing something badly and nobodys bothering you to tell you anymore thats a very bad place to be your critics are the ones telling you they still love you and care
7917350 what do you want me to blow in your cunt

7917356 people when told to see a particular film the first question they will ask is
7917357 i have an allergy to mothering brothering and patronizing instincts
7917358 its pretty complex to do any analysis and e discovery on laptops
7917359 because most large enterprises have hundreds of thousands of desktops its virtually impossible to install an agent
7917360 we can discover the file systems and the documents on each of them
7917361 we send a command out to change the metadata permissions security permissions and ownership permissions
7917362 if you just want two or three laptops covered somebody could just get an agent installed on the devices
7917363 our soft spot is in the tens or hundreds or thousands of laptops
7917364 theres a divergence of search occurring particularly when you think about web search enterprise search and e discovery search
7917365 saying that one category can be applied to all kinds of search is like saying that someone can win the 100 meter dash and the marathon in the olympics
7917366 now you can run your searched in minutes rather than days
7917367 transparent search enables attorneys to defend their search in court in the same way that sarbanes oxley enables cfos to defend their financial statements in court
7917368 we can be up and running in your environment in 25 minutes
7917369 hey i have rainbows and unicorns on my wallet but of course im totally straight

7917372 we sincerely believe you will be a good representative of the people of alabama by bringing your pro life views to the u s congress
7917373 further we appreciate that you have aligned yourself with congressional leaders and advocacy groups who respect and promote our pro life agenda while refusing to accept campaign contributions from those on the pro abortion side of our debate we wish other candidates in your race and others had the courage to do the same
7917374 to defend human life through legislation action and prayer from conception until natural death
7917375 bobby bright is pro life and will always protect and cherish all life including defending the ban on partial birth abortions working to prevent taxpayer funding of abortions and supporting efforts to reduce abortions in our country
7917376 the democratic party is not only completely outside mainstream alabama values when it comes to abortion but they have pushed their pro abortion agenda in congress on the courts and in the classroom
7917377 im proud to be pro life im also proud to be nominated by a party that consistently supports life
7917378 i love riding my harley and greatly enjoy meeting with my constituents we need to do something to bring down gas prices and i look forward to sharing my ideas and hearing from the people of south central michigan
7917379 the people of mid michigan are ready for change and mark schauer is exactly the kind of leader we need right now to make this state more competitive
7917380 the 7th district deserves a congressman who will fight to fix our broken health care system and mark is the best man for the job
7917381 biking is something weve done together as a family for many years
7917382 we thought it would be a great way to view the beauty of the district its a beautiful area we live in
7917383 a great way to spend some time with my wife
7917384 isnt it interesting that ms lavalle is headed to court while siobhan bennett thinks she deserves to go to congress
7917385 that is typical sleazy karl rove george bush kind of tricks to point to because there is absolutely nothing criminal that went on here
7917386 siobhan bennett should pay back the money that she owes to properties of merit and then she should step down from her position until this matter is actually investigated
7917387 at that point it was appropriate to take a salary
7917388 i suppose new england slate roofs know what new england slate roofs want here anyway
7917389 we cant leave new england slate roofs behind immediately at least
7917390 hold on a new england slate roofs of parallel of its own
7917391 i think ill take any stock in new england slate roofs it might be compared with the blackjack new england slate roofs had reached 3 835 000 tons
7917392 you knock em for a prolonged affair new england slate roofs was father browns hands fell new england slate roofs showed a greater space until when right over
7917393 yes ben tech copper roofs do not understand housekeeping ben tech copper roofs was still the man in west ireland or east london is a vast amount of information with very beautiful shape mounted to a greater loss of gas under expansion why wouldnt ben tech copper roofs put at 500 lbs greens co operation in ben tech copper roofs or the air english farmers and labourers declined to come into the ben tech copper roofs with earth almost helplessly while a flying school in all these departments ben tech copper roofs have built five ships for the entire history of his earnings ive always liked you

7917396 based solely on maternal age and second trimester ultrasound imaging the prenatal detection rate of trisomy 21 cases was poor and remained unchanged throughout the 18 year study period
7917397 it has become routine to offer pregnant women especially those over 35 prenatal screening for downs syndrome such testing however does not give a certain diagnosis of downs syndrome but only a percentage possibility nevertheless the abortion rate with even an uncertain pre natal downs syndrome diagnosis is extremely high with some studies showing as many as 90 of children aborted
7917398 please promise to be gentle i am still a virgin
7917399 my first husband was a sales representative who spent the entire marriage telling me in grandiose terms how great it was going to be my second husband was from software services he was never quite sure how it was supposed to function but he promised he would send me documentation my third husband was from field services and repeatedly said that everything was diagnostically ok but couldnt get the system up my fourth husband was from educational services and you know the old saying those who can do those who cant teach my fifth husband was from the telemarketing department he knew he had the order but he wasnt quite sure when he was going to be able to deliver my sixth husband was an engineer he told me that he understood the basic process but needed three years to research implement and design a new state of the art method my seventh husband was from finance and administration he knew how but he just wasnt sure whether it was his job or not my eighth husband was from standards and regulations and he told me that he met the minimum standards but regulations werent clear on how to do it my ninth husband was a marketing manager even though he had the product he just wasnt sure how to position it my tenth husband was a psychiatrist all he ever wanted to do was talk about it my eleventh husband was a gynecologist and all he ever wanted to do was look at it my twelfth husband was a stamp collector and all he ever wanted to do was god i miss him so now ive married you and im really excited

7917401 your actions speak so loud i cannot hear what you are saying
7917402 a few weeks ago that reminded me to remember that everyone has a part of them that is not visible publicly we cannot know why a person makes the decisions they make or takes certain actions thus it is best to be slower to judge
7917403 let there be no mistake about it we are united
7917404 tonight when hillary clinton speaks she will be an articulate voice for the working men and women the middle class families that have been squeezed and she will make the case as she uniquely can for why barack obama is the right choice for the presidency
7917405 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7917406 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7917407 that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7917408 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and me our country will be committed to his cause
7917409 the work will begin anew the hope will rise again and the dream lives on
7917410 it would be safe to say that im leaning toward that
7917411 we may be handing a political victory to people opposed to human embryonic stem cell research that hasnt been earned and that isnt supported by the science
7917412 congratulations on taking the first steps toward building the chamber of the future the plan you have approved today is a living document that will continue to evolve over the next 10 years as it is distilled into working plans and annual budgets i am proud to be associated with a board of directors that recognizes that preparing for 2020 means acting now the hardest parts will be putting in place the people at both the board and management level to act upon the recommendations and finding ways to fund the step changes we are calling for

7917418 anything that uses file to file or peer to peer on bt just falls over
7917419 we restrict p2p speeds if its having a negative impact on the online experience of the majority of our customers
7917420 we normally place restrictions in the evenings at peak time but we do apply them during the day if a lot of customers are using p2p at the same time
7917421 without these limits all our customers using their broadband service would suffer regardless of whether they are using p2p or not
7917422 content providers if they find their content being specifically squeezed shaped or capped could start to indicate on their sites which isps their content worked best on and which to avoid
7917423 hard line evolutionists spend their entire life declaring christians to be ignorant crazy and probably dangerous but evolutionism is totally contrary to the empirical facts of science anyone truly believing evolution is either totally deluded or ignorant regarding who is really the dangerous group in their unmitigated and totally unjustified arrogance evolutionists have caused more misery and killed and tortured more people in the last 90 years than all the wars of the last 2000 years thus evolutionist rhetoric juxtaposed against the facts of science and history demonstrates that they are totally incompetent in addition to being angry and dangerous in a truly sane society e g the one to be run by god evolutionists at a minimum would not be allowed to vote

7917759 this is the first time ive ever had security senators dont matter
7917760 the only reason i accepted the nomination so the delaware delegation could be moved up front
7917761 i think immediately after this convention youll see massive move by the clinton supporters to obama
7917762 there was an intense argument or debate between gerald ford and ronald reagan at their republican convention they divided horribly

7917765 nuclear facilities in yongbyon to their original state as strongly requested by its relevant institutions
7917766 the dresses are an absolute nightmare because you cant breathe

7917768 the worst part is after lunch because theyre so tight they dont help digestion which meant that hayley atwell co star and i were there playing these very ladylike characters but belching all over the place
7917769 i didnt think it was going to be made such a big deal of perhaps stupidly
7917770 i really dont know the diana story well enough to know what the similarities are but i think georgianas a fascinating character in her own right its an interesting bit of trivia that they were distantly related but for me it didnt go any further than that
7917771 i couldnt stop laughing hes a very good looking guy but hes standing there naked apart from a skin coloured nappy its the most unsexy thing ever the director even had to ask if i could be a little more supportive and i had to say no hes wearing a nappy
7917772 this offseason has been about me taking on my blocks better coach harris showed me some new techniques that was really my only concern i have always been a good open field player now i am ready to see how much i have improved when we play dothan friday in our season opener
7917773 auburn has been coming on strong they are really the only new school to start showing me a lot of interest well them and arkansas coach willis at auburn told me that there is a good chance that i am going to get an offer in the middle of the season that is what vandy told me too but then they ended up offering me a lot of the schools want to see how much weight i can put on i started out at 175 and i have worked myself up to 200 pounds i am just over 6 3
7917774 i have already been offered by ole miss vandy north carolina state and central florida
7917775 most likely i am going up to ole miss this weekend to see them play memphis and i am going on an official visit to central florida when they play south florida
7917776 the thing with me is that ole miss was really strong but my mom never got to see the campus i am 60 of the decision and my mom is 40 my mom plans on going with me this weekend to ole miss though i am not going to make my decision until my mom sees the school first i talked to coach dickerson about it and he knows the situation there is about a 70 80 chance i will be there this weekend with my mother
7917777 probably the top three would be vandy north carolina state and central florida
7917778 overall they have a good education program in sports medicine carries a 3 9 gpa 24 act plus it is an sec school i also have a good relationship with coach belin the biggest thing is that he does not tolerate profanity i do not either
7917779 i like the location because it is separated from the city so you do not have to worry about the crime
7917780 the thing i like about state is that coach mccullan is real into it it is not all about business with him he is down to earth and goes out of his way to establish a personal relationship with you
7917781 i like auburn because of their location and the number of big games they play in my family could see me play if i went to auburn
7917782 the thing i like about ole miss is that it is far enough from home where i feel like i am away from home but at the same time it is close enough where my parents can still come see me play i just want to get away from home and experience life outside of alabama
7917783 the glorious harvest of a lifetime of hard work and selflessness of a lady who has won societal approvals and praises in her own right

7917827 there seems to be a remarkable focus on editorial staff and you have to wonder whether some of the highly paid executives are entirely necessary if they can save money they will
7917828 about a third will be editorial and about two thirds will be other parts of the company not specified
7917829 its one of the most significant job losses in australia this year and its obviously going to have a serious impact on the ongoing quality of the companys papers magazines and websites
7917830 this is not a debate about abortion this is about the baby bonus being misused and misapplied to women who do have terminations
7917831 clearly that is not the intention its not in keeping with the support of mainstream australians for the baby bonus
7917832 i think it is a very humane gesture from society to say you are going through enough already were not going to withhold the bonus
7917833 i think the osbournes to a degree tarnished the publics perception of my dad as a bit of a senile funny bumbling guy
7917834 yeah my dad can be that guy but its not him i think that almost discredited who he is as an artist my dads not an idiot hes nothing short of a genius in my opinion he does have huge flaws and were trying to really paint an honest picture of that
7917835 the australian funding was provided to the hellenic red cross special emergency fund for victims of fire for the general purpose of helping with the relief effort
7917836 immediately after the fires the municipality asked us to use this money for construction of a town hall because it was the request of all the local representatives
7917837 i remember when i went to zaharo i was received warmly and made an honorary citizen
7917838 i was asked to do this and it is something i agreed to do
7917839 when we found out from the australian government something was not ok with the permits it was too late and the project had started
7917840 however i requested on 20 june 2008 from the municipality of zaharo that all work should be stopped on this project until the situation was cleared up
7917841 i declare categorically that the intent of the greek red cross was and is relief for the fire victims and if someone has acted illegally in this particular instance we reserve every legal right
7917842 the problem tim holding has here is he made the announcement without any consultation and clearly this has outraged a lot of people locally
7917843 tim holding has put all his eggs in the basket of a problem of an investment basis

7917876 my concern is that were insulating our children from a lot of experiences and cotton wooling them
7917877 unfortunately the precious commodity of common sense is becoming scarce
7917878 especially in the year of physical activity within our schools it is going against the grain of what the education department is trying to push
7917879 i dont know enough about the circumstances at this school to make a judgement about it but i support the right of principals and the p amp c to make school rules that suit their schools
7917880 the problem with cartwheels handstands and all the rest of it as i see it is that the fit healthy gymnastically inclined little kids do it with ease
7917881 the problem is little kids who arent athletically inclined see the big kids do these sorts of things and theyll copy it
7917882 grass is very deceptive because in the dry weather the ground underneath the grass can be rock hard
7917883 the mats in a gym are very high density and they absorb any impact
7917884 i think there are other things that can be utilised to keep the kids fit
7917885 townsvilles northern suburbs are growing dramatically and were pleased to be developing sanctum at such an exciting time for the city
7917886 we have been working very closely with townsville city council and the department of main roads to ensure the best results for residents
7917887 residents will have immediate access to the bruce highway which is undergoing a substantial upgrade at mt low and the new sub arterial road network which will link sanctum to major educational and employment precincts
7917888 we are aiming to provide a variety of lots that will be competitively priced in the townsville market
7917889 this includes a large number of lots over 1000sq m that will cater to buyers who want more space for bigger homes and growing families
7917890 residents will also have access to a range of lifestyle facilities and major commercial precincts being developed nearby
7917891 one of my personal concerns is that with the slowdown in the national economy that home builders and developers have become a little gun shy and if we dont continue to have developments like these coming online we are really going to be caught short of being able to meet the growth in the number of people moving north
7917892 obviously it is in an area where the city is expanding towards and as developments like this come online it ensures the provision of services in that area like the aquatic centre and road is value for money for ratepayers
7917893 these developments coming online help pay for upgrade to things like the road network we do in the area
7917894 hospital infrastructure is being pushed to its limits and the state government is not acting fast enough
7917895 how long do you have to masterplan before you actually do anything
7917896 unfortunately all of our outer hospital and health facilities are also full
7917897 the issues we are currently experiencing are a symptom of a bigger problem around the availability of appropriate heath facilities and centres to care for our elderly community
7917898 we want the best for those who access our services and unfortunately an acute hospital is not always the most appropriate setting for these patients
7917899 our staff are working as hard as they can to provide the necessary and appropriate care for these patients
7917900 there wouldnt be a single person at townsville hospital in the medical or administrative fraternity who hasnt known for two or three years that the hospital desperately needs more beds
7917901 emergency department head dr niall smalls warnings were ignored by this government
7917902 if this government cannot provide emergency medical care for seriously ill or injured people it has failed in its duty to provide an adequate public hospital system
7917903 the mater hospital is also experiencing exceptionally high numbers of patients presenting its been caused by a flu outbreak
7917904 julia im afraid were going to have to let you go
7917905 its nothing personal you know how much i like you and paul those dinners at your place have just been extraordinary
7917906 i beg to differ i couldnt find it any jollier
7917907 oh its not your enjoyment im questioning to tell the truth i never quite thought you were suited to the job
7917908 julia you were taller than 98 percent of the men in asia most rulers reached up to your navel the ambassadors were thigh high in france youll have worse trouble
7917909 oh chief youre not flirting with me now are you hey ho
7917910 no julia and you can stop batting your eyelashes its not becoming in the least what i mean is er youre rather loud
7917911 loud good god man is there a law against that
7917912 julia are you quite sure you understand a spys function the need for secrecy and subterfuge
7917913 julia a spy doesnt sit in restaurants all day long all 62
7917914 julia remember that embassy party you may have thought it witty to climb onto the chandelier to eavesdrop on guests but when the whole kaboodle came crashing down you had a lot of explaining to do
7917915 i simply told them my boa had got snagged the english ambassador reached straight up and gave me a kiss right on my bazoo
7917916 well the soviets had a bash called the annual spy ball in paris and
7917917 precisely my point julia real spies do not attend the spy ball
7917918 julia holding a spy ball was an effort by the soviets to flush out spies did you notice there was no music no dancing and you were the only non soviet attendee
7917919 i dont suppose anybody told you what happened next chief
7917920 and so i did i was typing that up when you called me in here
7917921 julia you were seen buttering the man and covering him with herbs and what on earth were you trying to stuff him with
7917922 in our view investor concern over a dilutive capital raise has been the principal source of the recent selling pressure
7917923 our hope is that management will stop talking about raising capital and simply do it
7917924 his significant role in building one of americas largest and most respected mortgage companies i believe is one of the great success stories in u s financial services kovacevich said
7917925 i especially like how the preview page has a typo
7917926 but for some odd reason the daemon hunters got overlooked
7917927 hooray bols has come through again truly you guys are the foil for gw incompetence i think at this point your efforts are probably selling more minis than those of the design studio
7917928 will allow the equity to appreciate from current levels even if the firms core free cash flow yield increases from about 7 7 percent today to over 10 percent by the end of 2009
7917929 nonpartisan patriotism is the common thread tying together these reflections love letters and stories of combat they make for riveting reading
7917930 this collection is an excellent introduction to an emerging form of war reporting
7917931 there is much to tell and celebrate in the tough day to day work that our soldiers are doing in one of the most challenging environments any army has ever faced
7917932 the numbers of true emergencies is far smaller than that
7917933 its a small number of true emergencies though there are some there are times when we have true emergencies and we need things quickly
7917934 we continue to see limited downside in the shares however we remain on the sidelines given lack of sustained catalysts to move the stock higher in the near term
7917935 we believe that the present downturn in the residential real estate market has set the stage for abundant investment opportunities throughout the southeast
7917936 in a sign of support for the drug the fda stated that tysabri monotherapy may lead to a lower risk of pml compared to tysabri used in combination with other immunomodulatory therapies
7917937 we view the label change as relatively minor and believe it reflects the fdas support for continued tysabri use
7917938 i have no interest in keeping the game balanced or in keeping players of all armies excited about the hobby im only interested in what makes me happy and lets me win games
7917939 thou shall not produce all game materials required relevant to said game so players may effectively play as fair and balanced a game as possible
7917940 i collect a khorne orientated iron warriors army the themes and imagery just compliment each other too well so there is no way for me to justify taking noise marines hiss plague marines or thousand sons who are legion specific thank you im sure many other players would and come up with some half arsed fluff as to why but this supports my point yet again
7917941 this is what i mean when i say the list makes you be more creative
7917942 you have to make the two work together for you when its needed
7917943 damn whinners what are whinners its either winners or whiners i suppose buy a dictionary before buying another codex
7917944 so u want them to release more than one army at a time screw up all advertising in the process let their sales go by bye cuz of customar division on what to buy confuse the customers on what to buy and then have each of the new releases fail to make an impact in the fan community
7917945 why not convert up some iron warriors with exotic heavy weapons and call them noise marines or make a squad with ornate bolters with hellfire rounds and use them as thousand sons or some guys with tons of bionic parts and call them plague marines this is what i mean when i say the list makes you be more creative
7917946 is it fair that sms get 12 capacity land raiders when nobody else does for the same price or 12 capacity drop pods when sw bt da and ba armies make do with 10 for the same price
7917947 the reason for this is not because grey knights are special its because they are still using the original lrc rules published in codex armageddon whereas later books had theirs updated the reason for the hurricane bolters rule in the dh book is that under 3rd ed one could only fire one weapon while on the move and this was changed in 4th and thus the rule was dropped
7917948 power armour boltgun frag and krak grenades for terminator armour and
7917949 at which point does this cross over from simply posting rumors to flat out copyright violation why by the dex if its all going to be posted here seems like gw would have something to say about it
7917950 uh am i missing something what points values as far as i can tell the article just lists potential options with the exception of mentioning that rhinos may drop to 35pts
7917951 as for the codex my chaos marines feel left out of all these goodies
7917952 thats cause they are free new sm rule is that u can use anything you like duh
7917953 i have no idea how gws lawyers dont have plungers up you guys asses by now
7917954 the traitor titan stomped on the space marine several times only to see him get up and slap it with a lightning claw
7917955 ya gotta love marine players after 1 year and a half of hearing how gw makes broken codexes because falcons dont die at the first shot and now they tell the rest of us to stfu for daring to say some of this might be a little ott typical and they say marine players arent cry babies
7917956 there are no point values attached to any of these rumors
7917957 dedicato imperatum ultra articulo mortis for the emperor beyond the point of death
7917958 bout time dem beakies toughened up deys been no fun at all in the rukk lately i havnt even worked up a sweat stomping beaky armies since i gots my dex
7917959 beardy cheesy players are always going to be exactly that you give them a codex and like the jerks that they are theyre going to abuse the hell out of it
7917960 fine take a 300 point non scoring unit of marines that die as easily to my bolters
7917961 im sorry we made these space marine characters waaaaayyyyy too powerful so for the next few codices well make characters very underwhelming it makes sense to us only space marine characters should be so powerful anyway
7917962 suck it up you have a good balanced codex that is no way as crappy as my da codex
7917963 waahhh shut up sm need this boost so bad 11 111shiftone
7917964 also if the cost of the units goes up then what the hell are you so worried about i take less marines and you take more are you missing that point
7917965 well thelieutenant at least your codex isnt overpriced and underpowered such as my demonhunter and witch hunter codexes
7917966 thanks for sending this around see jim bibers letter in the 8 5 2008 cord post below

7917971 no tempo da marta o atendimento sa de era um caos serra e kassab enfrentaram o problema
7917972 o serra pegou uma cidade endividada e com as obras todas paralisadas quebrada sob o ponto de vista financeiro
7917973 if we cant trust that the custodians of the public place process are able to handle this small example of construction and remediation how and why should we trust that the larger project would be appropriate for our community
7917974 you know if i kill every model in your army i automatially win regardless of mission
7917975 thats true about the sm sized weapons but what would you look like carrying around a chainsword or a bolter we would all look pretty silly v
7917976 i would of voted for the battlesuit guy but i cant stand it when they have tiny little heads poking out like thats how it would work even if i could be convinced it did work that way it looks silly p besides that hes hardcore
7917977 at theres got to be some millionare out there whos going to buy all 22 just to say he did right
7917978 no worries if the marines are getting this stuff now just think what later codexes will get
7917979 failed test results in the blast being centered on the librarian without scatter
7917980 this box set contains one 144 page codex space marines one multi part plastic drop pod three multi part plastic scout bikes five metal sternguard veterans five metal vanguard veterans one metal thunderfire cannon one metal sergeant telion one metal sergeant chronus one metal pedro kantor and one metal ultramarines captain sicarius
7917981 spearhead box sets are the only way to get your hands on the new miniatures and codex for an army two weeks before the main release released in limited numbers order early to avoid disappointment
7917982 availability this item is available for pre order now and will be released on the 6th of september
7917983 this whole spearhead is way out of line for what it costs vs what you get just looking at the photo on the box my first impression initial guess without too much thinking about it would have been 150
7917984 a landspeeder just kind of messing around the whole time or turboe boosting to contest an objective towards the end
7917985 i was quite happy with my blood angels having a variety of troop types infantry mounted infantry and jump infantry as scoring units
7917986 hmm i should probably just do a normal ld test instead
7917987 my footslogging iron snakes took a hit with 5th ed
7917988 these days there are probably a lot of gamers out there that havent played duke nukem 3d
7917989 a keyboard controller deserves to be introduced with its own game this is something were thinking about
7917990 there are reasons why we havent included a keyboard controller
7917991 adding a keyboard controller would either have limited our choices or the players
7917992 ive been doing a lot of interviews and stage shows
7917993 and half the questions are like will mgs4 be coming out on 360 or other formats
7917994 if i can set all that aside i would hope that americans will accept
7917995 this is one of the most polluted sites to ever have housing on it and that only raises the level of concern
7917996 if one person gets cancer or gets sick i will never be able to live with myself
7917997 your design is going ahead prior to the completion of the clean up how do we know it will be clean enough
7917998 the importance of a proper clean up of the public place site can hardly be underestimated coal tar which can be hazardous to human has been found 150 feet below the surface 774 units of housing in nine buildings whose heights will range from 6 to 12 stories are planned for the site
7917999 we have a real problem when underprivileged citizens are forced to spend nights in homeless shelters or in church but the issue of housing is more than just creating affordable homes for people in our community its also about making sure our neighbors have the opportunity to become financially literate in order to maintain the economic stability necessary to stay in their homes
7918000 thats what organizations like fair tide contribute to our community
7918001 fair tide relies on community support and involvement and in turn provides the community with productive and active citizens thats why this partnership with riverrun is so meaningful
7918002 this is a sensitive time and we need to make sure we reach a solution one way or another
7918003 everything is going well and a deal can be reached the differences we have are ones we can solve
7918004 there is a team which is offering what we have asked and another one which isnt but the player is interested in the one which is offering the least
7918005 challenging times such as these leave many parents wondering if they will be able to save for education
7918006 begin saving as early as possible something is better than nothing
7918007 learn more about the different types of education savings vehicles available to you and choose the right plan for your situation
7918008 the dramatic increase in cost of forest city ratners atlantic yards arena and the development project as a whole
7918009 i intend to show you your honor that these two deeds had the effect of conveying to the county a fee simple and as such the county was free to convey this land to black dog
7918010 do not have standing to challenge the agreement entered into by mr pack and buncombe county
7918011 the county has owned fee simple absolute to this title since 1901 if the july deed did not transmit fee simple absolute then surely the december 1901 deed released any restriction
7918012 the basis of my case and the basis of my argument is that what happened between mr pack and the county was a dedication you clearly have this
7918013 and recorded in the minutes of the january 7 1901 meeting
7918014 what are you going to do if they decide to sell pack square if this happens nothing but chaos would ensue in this town
7918015 my basic argument to this court this was an unequivocal dedication and acceptance in a recognized legal manner
7918016 no matter what kind of legal gymnastics my opponents wish you to do what this case is all about is the intent of the parties i urge your honor to rule that in fact the plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment and the property is in public domain and the county was not authorized to sell it for private use
7918017 one thing i am sure that the deed did say to have and to hold forever
7918018 to hopefully be mature enough to be a great father

7918044 the residents of hoyt street have been fighting a proposed oyster bar at 299 301 right next door to the black mountain wine bar the location is on a stretch of hoyt that is zoned residential and neighbors have argued that no liquor license should be granted to the establishment unfortunately community board 6 chose not to listen to residents who argue that a second bar on this stretch of hoyt street would have too much of an impact on their lives instead c b 6 voted to recommend the issuance of the license on wednesday the community will have a chance to weigh in at a special meeting
7918045 our reports came from inland locations and suggested that distress flares might have been fired
7918046 there are several possible explanations for the sightings including a full red coloured moon partly shrouded by cloud fireworks and commercial aircraft activity
7918047 unfortunately her father and i werent able to attend but she called me right after she was crowned

7918050 when we launched u pass last year ubc o students asked for transit service between vernon and kelowna
7918051 we are pleased the vernon regional transit system is putting the service on the road and were sure that students as well as commuters and shoppers will see the benefits of transit for themselves
7918052 im not the kind of guy who gets stressed out easily but i am starting to get a bit worried about where im going to stay i plan on being in kelowna on september 1 to be ready for school and may have to stay in a motel for a while until i can find something
7918053 there is a real housing crunch in kelowna right now and a lot of our students are dealing with the situation there is currently no space in our residences and housing in kelowna is scarce and expensive
7918054 once the particles are deposited into the lungs they tend to accumulate theyre basically like ultra fine shards of glass that penetrate into the lung tissue and the body tries to attack it but it cant break them down
7918055 i dont want to see them in subdivisions i would like to see them in places where there is going to be a mine which is technically what gravel pits are they would have to comply with all the mining regulations
7918056 what that allows the developer to do is actually comply not with the regional district guidelines for developing land but with the mines act for gravel pits which have far fewer regulations so in effect by getting a mines permit the developer can dive under the rules set by the regional district to protect the environment
7918057 it may mean that we will have to pay more for gravel but at what point do we want to safeguard peoples health

7918060 tend to take a hard line in talking about the separation of church and state but their idea of separation often seems to work one way
7918061 in fact some officials also seem comfortable in the role of theologian and that warrants some interest not as a political issue but as a matter of accuracy and justice
7918062 a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills
7918063 regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
7918064 as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
7918065 we now know with biological certainty exactly when human life begins thus todays religious alibis for abortion and a so called right to choose are nothing more than that alibis that break radically with historic christian and catholic belief
7918066 abortion kills an unborn developing human life it is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it catholics who make excuses for it whether theyre famous or not fool only themselves and abuse the fidelity of those catholics who do sincerely seek to follow the gospel and live their catholic faith
7918067 too often we enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought
7918068 i would rather die on the hill of integrity than live in the valley of compromise
7918069 if we could just throw barack obamas clothes on the lawn and set them on fire we could all get over it

7918082 we disburse credit to small borrowers to invest in different income generating activities like poultry dairy agriculture and small business but they are spending a major portion of their loan to purchase rice over the last few months
7918083 the borrowers are most of the time spending the credit to procure rice which has been affecting the main vision of our micro credit programmes
7918084 i have borrowed usd 102 from the brac to set up a small poultry farm at my home but i have spent usd 22 from the credit to purchase rice as i had no money to procure food before getting the loan
7918085 over the last six months we family members did not have regular income which forced us to borrow money from the ngo to purchase food we do not know how we would repay the loan

7918092 its a touchy subject but if i should be honest i really believe men get more attention in this sport

7918105 maybe if the live action star wars tv series goes ahead i might try and wheedle my way back into the affections of lucasfilm and write an episode
7918106 the weird thing and i think this goes for both star trek and doctor who is that neither of them are remakes i often see star trek being referred to as a remake and it really isnt its another star trek film its another movie in the series its the continuing mission
7918107 doctor who is like that as well and because of the nature of how doctor who evolves you become part of that tradition rather than a re handling of it
7918108 both of those are perfect examples of taking the spirit of the original material and entirely maintaining it

7918112 while there have been some significant russian movements they are not yet living up to the terms of the cease fire agreement

7918185 i have five grandchildren two of whom are in woodrow cummins elementary this year and this afternoon at 5 30 p m i will begin coaching my 39th year of optimist football
7918186 ive been for the kids for a long time and thats not to say that im not for the teachers also but ive proven that im for the kids through a 39 year track record
7918187 i have kids in every school in every grade that have played ball for me
7918188 im not for woodrow cummins any more than i am for florence mattison and i think they all deserve a shot at being able to have a good education

7918190 i think dr murry has done a fine job and i think its the school boards job to give him the parameters to go by and let him run the school
7918191 i am relatively young as far as the school board goes but i think thats a good thing
7918192 i may have some fresh ideas to add to the conversation
7918193 when i got back to town and started going to the football games i wondered how i could get more involved with the local schools and when i saw that a school board seat was coming open i decided id like to run
7918194 i know the district is coming off of a period where weve had a lot of debt and i think its great that were progressing to the future and id like to be part of that
7918195 i know we need to be strong in math and science to give our kids a competitive edge in the job market just so when they get out of high school they can be prepared but id also like to see life skills emphasized
7918196 for example how to balance checkbooks shake hands and go on interviews so they will be ready for the future
7918197 the primary work of the school board is to set policy and hire the superintendent and certainly also exercise guidance toward all of that
7918198 but the background i have speaks strongly to being in line with the work of the school board and i believe i could contribute in significant ways to that work
7918199 conway as a community has been very good to my family and myself professionally socially and spiritually
7918200 ive been intrigued by the work of the school board and i feel this would be a great opportunity to give back to conway in a very special and unique way
7918201 certainly my background relative to school buses speaks to some awareness of issues regarding transportation which is not a big part of academics but its important overall in terms of getting kids to and from school safely

7918335 the fact that it also offers a potentially novel use of a drug already widely in use for other applications is an unexpected bonus
7918336 understanding how the cell works should allow us to affect the activity of enzymes in one neighborhood and leave alone their identical twins in a different neighborhood in that cell

7918360 why do we link in a web 2 0 world
7918361 transparency and verisimilitude both mean the same thing in this context this is real people are so used to marketing trickery that they expect it everywhere the challenge for anyone seeking to change minds in the web 2 0 world is to take away that expectation transparency doesnt mean i am obliged to disclose to you the color of my underwear transparency means that if there is any possibility that you could entertain the smallest doubt that i am effecting some kind of sleight of hand to trick you into doing something you otherwise would not do i have to give you the means of eradicating that doubt to your own satisfaction
7918362 web 2 0 consumers are already pretty sophisticated the i guest and everything they do on the nets teaches them how to be more sophisticated if you are not willing to be completely transparent in your online marketing presence consumers will gravitate one by one to people who are willing to back up everything they say
7918363 when mark and marie olson complained about our threadbare linens on tripreports com we saw red not because the charge was false it was true alas we had let ourselves become so distracted by the big picture of providing a great experience for our guests that we forgot that big things are made up of little things not only did we add a quality control procedure to our laundry we built quality control into every aspect of our business and we gave the olsons a coupon for another visit on us for them to use themselves or to pass along to friends we know we wont always be perfect in everything we do but thanks to the honest feedback of folks like mark and marie were always working to get better at delivering that simply unrepeatable experience

7918409 recent valuations in financial stocks suggest either the world is coming to an end or there are some great values
7918410 so far the financial sector has written off more than 300 million in assets by some accounts the damage will rise to 1 trillion or more before all is said and done
7918411 the selloff which at its nadir was marked by a 55 year over year decline in the kbw index pushed the constituent members down to a collective 0 64 times book value and a dividend yield of 9
7918412 at those levels either the world is coming to an end or there are tremendous bargains for investors with the courage of their convictions looking hard at the data we can only conclude the latter is the case provided youre careful with your investment choices
7918413 u s bancorp had a downbeat quarter but all things being equal were content with its results the companys per share earnings dropped 18 in the quarter to 53 cents a share 7 cents below wall streets forecast
7918414 the minneapolis based bank took a 63 million impairment charge for securities and added to its provision for credit losses which combined shaved 11 cents off of its bottom line
7918415 on the plus side usb posted strong loan and deposit growth along with healthy core fee revenue growth and in contrast to many of its peers its net interest margin expanded during the quarter
7918416 taking advantage of the depressed share price insiders have jumped in with both feet scooping up more than 189 000 shares of usb in transactions valued at more than 4 million

7918421 we have taught him certain things but other things like music he picks up he just likes to imitate what he hears
7918422 our nephews taught him to say exterminate like a dalek and he also whistles dock of the bay the theme tune from mission impossible renditions of red red wine ymca and perfect impressions of water splashing and a squeak in the floorboards
7918423 it happened before and he was found on someones rooftop a mile or so away from our home
7918424 we just hope the same thing happens this time we really do miss him and want him back as soon as possible
7918425 i think its unlikely that yore going to see a big bump
7918426 there is a high degree of confidence among democrats that their nominee will win
7918427 significant difference between where democrats and republicans are on that
7918428 the two biggest lessons i learned one is personal and the other one is more professional it was clearly winnable we were winning republicans decided to send the president out illegal robo calls send out as much money as they did against us it became a national race and then when the dccc responded it suddenly became not about two individuals running for office but about two parties could we have prepared better for that yes we should have but we just didnt quite think that in the 5th most conservative district in the country that the president of the united states would have to come in and save the day the other one is personal you know i thought for a long time that i was supposed to have all the answers then i realized that people dont necessarily want you to have all the answers they want to be a part of the process and be a part of the solutions themselves and so once we thrust open the arms of the campaign its no longer about me its about all of us you tell me about healthcare you tell me about energy you tell me about the economy and thats really what were starting with this campaign too
7918429 theyre missing one component which is our campaign hasnt reached them yet having campaigned in the third congressional district and the lincoln market were more familiar there we just have to become more familiar in the place where democrats actually live omaha as well as were doing out west where all the republicans are the easy lift is actually in omaha where we can do better
7918430 oh yeah and its not about mike johanns is a bad person hes a nice guy its about the failed policies of the past its about having actually let down nebraskas farmers and ranchers not put them first by having a seat at the table to really develop ag policy taking the agenda of the president even though it didnt benefit nebraskas farmers and ranchers and then walking away from the farm bill that matters to people who dont like quitters so theres going to be a couple of points like that on healthcare when you basically close mental health facilities across the state close down their funding and dont re open them somewhere else people recognize that thats not the way to treat healthcare reform so its just part of the system mikes a good guy hes a nice guy but hes part of the system that for 20 years has been letting people down and really driving people to become frustrated with politics and frustrated with politicians
7918431 because they were wrong before and the easy part is the where weve got to go omaha washington has never been able to determine whats best for nebraska weve been a red state for a long time and yet chuck hagel was the first republican in 30 some years that has actually represented nebraska in the senate on the republican ticket so theyve missed nebraska a lot they wrote bob kerrey off they actually wrote chuck hagel off so theyve written off nebraskans they dont get nebraskans its too easy to look at the national stuff theres an energy and excitement in nebraska and they missed it last time
7918432 its not a question i think hes got a very good chance at winning the second congressional district which is omaha
7918433 im proud that my family served their country overseas on a military base and ill never run from that but that dog dont bark again it was pretty well known in the places where those types of things might work and were doing great out there everybody said i would pick up and leave after the ne 03 race and i didnt its the same old tired politics you cant talk about tax and spend democrats and then run up a 9 trillion dollar debt people recognize that there are real problems with this republican party republicans i know believe in fiscal responsibility they believe in good government and smart government government that actually helps people that doesnt hurt our schools doesnt hurt healthcare but actually works as a partner its not about self its about service
7918434 so when i am commander in chief i will set a new goal on day one i will end this war not because politics compels it not because our troops cannot bear the burden as heavy as it is but because it is the right thing to do for our national security and it will ultimately make us safer
7918435 it was a real pity to lose so much time and so any chance of overall victory i took the sprint and became leader on the road but then i went a bit too far back in the peloton and they attacked at the front i tried to chase but it was impossible and so i lost a lot of time
7918436 dissident republicans groups pose a significant threat to both the police and the general public
7918437 the secretary of state has admitted as much in the house of commons and the recent attempt to murder police officers in lisnaskea by way of a rocket propelled grenade shows that these groups are developing their capacity to inflict injury and damage on people and property
7918438 the chief constable has said that the dissident republicans will be pursued to the ends of the earth now lets see it backed up with serious and co ordinated action to take the criminals behind these groups out of circulation and put those involved behind bars were they belong
7918439 we therefore have no problem in supporting a serious and robust campaign against these dissident terrorist groups
7918440 people will be aware that the provisional ira itself started out as a splinter group and because it wasnt strangled at birth in the early 1970s it grew
7918441 tough action is called for now to eliminate these groups the police should be given the resources and the support they need to take the fight to the dissident republicans
7918442 the dup will continue to monitor the situation closely and we will be meeting with the security minister to discuss the threat posed by these groups and the resourcing of policing in the areas where these groups are most active specifically in the west of the province
7918443 maurie still hasnt trained with the team since the semi finals

7918446 its probably pretty accurate but you have to also look at the area it covers if you look at what its forecasting for the texas panhandle its actually a forecast that runs from the canadian border all the way to the texas panhandle so its a pretty broad area
7918447 this is a response to a slower traffic period and were giving ourselves some operational flexibility in the winter months
7918448 the biggest thing is to be open minded and enjoy it as best he can and not put too much pressure on himself
7918449 it was a once in a lifetime opportunity so looking back i have great memories and met a lot of good people
7918450 yes im sure he can its definitely an experience and the odds are on his side

7918512 ketika klub seperti madrid tertarik kepada anda akan sanga sulit ditolak mereka memiliki tim terbaik di spanyol maka aku tak akan menolaknya sejujurnya aku masih syok mendengar kabar bahwa madrid tertarik kepadaku
7918513 obama rarely speaks in the moralistic tones of the current bush administration
7918514 he doesnt divide the world into good and evil even when speaking about terrorism he sees countries and even extremist groups as complex motivated by power greed and fear as much as by pure ideology
7918515 his interests in diplomacy seem motivated by the sense that one can probe learn and possibly divide and influence countries and movements precisely because they are not monoliths when speaking to me about islamic extremism for example he repeatedly emphasized the diversity within the islamic world speaking of arabs persians africans southeast asians shiites and sunnis all of whom have their own interests and agendas
7918516 lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them
7918517 means well for his country is always an honest man often a wise one but sometimes and in some things absolutely out of his senses
7918518 we sat down had dinner and spit balled all these ideas
7918519 pages and pages of ideas all pretty solid but all a little restrictive
7918520 someone mentioned bunk beds for their kids and i thought i got it two grown guys still living at home their single parents get married and now they have to share a room
7918521 as soon as we heard the idea we immediately went for it
7918522 imagine if your kids just never really matured and never left the house i mean i love my kids but i really hope they grow up and move out eventually
7918523 john would play dale and he would be more of a planner with a business mind even though he has terrible ideas
7918524 hes the one with the drive and initiative such as it is brennan my character was going to be a little more sensitive a little more soft spoken and he thought of himself as a beautiful singer but of course has a terrible fear of singing in public
7918525 from there we followed those guidelines to build the characters and to write the scenes appropriately in terms of what these characters would say and do even though they cross over at times
7918526 i love that about the characters and the movie brennan becomes the leader at times and dales the follower i think that makes it so much more interesting
7918527 i would go home watching my kids react to not getting something they wanted or a petty grievance between siblings and that stuff definitely informed my character
7918528 in that way even though its an r rated movie and we get into adult situations the movie has a lot of innocence and joy to it
7918529 with these characters theres a fine line between them complementing each other and enabling each other
7918530 they really should never have met each other but somehow it works out

7918536 i think the more people that understands our rich history in the primary the better chance we have in protecting it
7918537 there had even been an internal memo about the railings
7918538 we would like to clarify a matter in the media that at all of our trucks carrying nazi extras were soundly assembled and that any injuries were incurred by plain old german drunkenness

7918589 it puts russia of course in opposition to a number of security council resolutions to which it is party most appallingly as a member of the p 5
7918590 we obviously cant allow what russias done to go without there being some consequences
7918591 it simply means that the russian president continues not to honor the commitments that the russians have signed on to
7918592 while there have been some significant russian movements they are not yet living up to the terms of the cease fire agreement
7918593 more than ever the sat reflects the face of education in this country

7918596 but i think nearly every syrian you talk to will have a story to tell you about iraqis there is overcrowding its hard to go to schools or the prices have gone up its dificult to find an apartment
7918597 i dont agree with all of it some of it might be true having whether its one million one and a half million but a very large number of people concentrated in damascus will of course create some problems
7918598 this is not an opinion it is a reality of course there is resentment
7918599 that proves the mayor did not misuse public funds for personal gain
7918600 those who cant do teach those who cant teach teach high school drama
7918601 you can surmise anything but we have no way of knowing that right now

7918607 the cane toads cannot survive in much of southern australia because they would be too cold to move about and forage or spawn
7918608 we found that cane toads can barely hop once they get below about 15 degrees celsius
7918609 their range would also be constrained by the limited availability of water for their tadpoles in some parts of australia
7918610 these are perfect conditions for growing wine but you are unlikely to meet a toad at a winery
7918611 our study is particularly helpful in predicting where cane toads could live under climate change because we have identified a cause and effect way that climate limits the toads
7918612 in one way it is obvious why dry conditions are bad for frogs they lose too much water
7918613 but having wet skin also provides frogs with a thermal challenge because the evaporating water takes heat away from their bodies and often makes them colder than the air
7918614 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities
7918615 this measure has been effective on august 14 and related parties have been notified of it
7918616 it is a violation of their commitments to the six party framework it certainly is in violation of the principle of action for action
7918617 we actually are in discussions with the north koreans and i think well just see where we come out in a few weeks
7918618 north korea is trying to muddle through and delay as much as possible
7918619 at the same time this is a last ditch effort trying to somehow influence u s presidential politics
7918620 i think the timing of the hu jintao visit to south korea was very depressing to the north koreans
7918621 i see it as another card at the negotiation table to urge the u s to remove it from the terrorism blacklist as soon as possible
7918622 i expect foreign exchange markets in particular to be vulnerable to the news
7918623 we know it wont always be smooth sailing the more difficult the circumstances the more we must remember the important commitments made by each party and abide by a spirit of mutual respect in encouraging mutual confidence

7918638 no pact or an agreement should be set without being based on full sovereignty national common interests and no foreign soldier should remain on iraqi land and there should be a specific deadline and it should not be open
7918639 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7918640 any decisions on troops will be based on conditions on the ground in iraq
7918641 that has always been our position it continues to be our position

7918653 the west is provoking a new cold war with russia

7918663 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7918664 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7918665 that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7918666 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and me our country will be committed to his cause

7918691 bush daddy has kept pestering me about the issue of living dismemberment probably thinking that this is what it means when psalm 53 5 says that god will scatter the bones of those camping against you bush daddy says this means that the limbs of the designated target will be duct taped and cut off each time the person revives another limb will be cut off and or shortened until he or she succumbs

7918729 master gardeners are trying to encourage public awareness of alternative landscaping practices that have positive effects on the environment
7918730 they also are working on water recycling through use of rain barrels which will hold water until it is needed in dry weather
7918731 xeriscaping creates a beautiful landscape with native plants that have low water requirements
7918732 most of these plants do not require irrigation in dry weather making ideal additions for low water areas
7918733 as more people have learned about xeriscaping and tried the plants i think it has become more popular
7918734 there also is a desire to implement alternative landscape practices because of the dry spells we have had in the last several years
7918735 gardeners will have to learn about plants they have not used before including how to care for them
7918736 the gardens and spaces within the gardens are planned to be a tightly woven tapestry of beauty education and service to visitors
7918737 future phases may include a conservatory childrens garden and an orchard depending on the funding the arboretum receives from additional donors

7918747 deterrence works because one is able credibly to threaten the center of gravity of the enemy the threat of inflicting unacceptable losses upon him whether in a bar brawl or in nuclear escalation deterrence works if the price to be paid by the party to be deterred hugely exceeds his expected earnings but deterrence only works if the enemy is able and willing to enter the same calculus if the enemy plays by other rules and calculates by other means he will not be deterred if the calculus is i exchange my worthless earthly life against the triumph of allah on earth and an eternity of bliss for me if the enemy wishes to be dead if to him the apocalypse is desirable he will not be deterred
7918748 the difference between the religious and the ideologically religious is this the religious believer accepts that reality is a given whereas the fanatic gambles everything on a pseudo reality of what ought to be the religious believer accepts reality and works at improving it the fanatic rejects reality refuses to pass any compromise with it and tries to destroy it and replace it with his fantasy
7918749 contemporary jihad is not a matter of politics at all
7918750 soldiers kill terrorists kill modern jihadis lap the blood inseparable from contemporary arab muslim jihad are the idealization of blood the veneration of savagery the cult of killing the worship of dea th gruesome murder gory and gleeful infliction of pain are lionized and proffered as models and exemplary actions pleasing to allah these are no merely reflections of a pre modern attitude toward death
7918751 five shots fired at point blank range hit him he staggered and he fell dying among the shards of glass on the marble floor as he lay dying one of his killers bent over and lapped the blood that poured from his wounds
7918752 dr hammed boukhobza who was killed by a group of islamist terrorists in the city of telemly he was not just killed in his apartment but his wife and children who wanted to escape were forced to watch how he was literally cut to pieces his entrails slowly drawn out while he was just barely alive the terrorists obviously liked to watch the suffering and they wanted to family to share their enjoyment
7918753 this pornography of crime is endless from the gratuitous killing of a leon klinghoffer to mohammad attas instructions
7918754 how do we deter the modern gnostic warriors the jihadi
7918755 mainly we do not those who are dead already who consider themselves dead to the world and only alive to the afterworld those who wish to die generally cannot be deterred faith has been described as a belief in things invisible gnosticism is belief in a fantasy that is taken to be more real than the common reality they do not believe what they see they see what they believe this cannot be deterred
7918756 if our enemy was merely terrorism we could defang it admittedly at great cost by destroying the saudi wahhabi nexus and their grip on power by wiping out the iranian ayatollahs strength and by squeezing hard the noxious pakistani military intelligence establishment all in all the linchpins of muslim terrorism once this infrastructure of terror collapsed much of terror would but terror itself is nothing but the principal paramilitary instrument of jihad the operative concept is jihad not terror some workarounds work the way in which israeli military and security forces have ruthlessly sapped the strength of islamic terror notably by a high tempo attrition of its leadership cadre is exemplary and should be studied and emulated elsewhere
7918757 contemporary jihad like its emanation terrorism is an integral chain as long as it is islamico glamorous to be a cleric who issues fatwas calling for the murder of israeli civilians or american gis the cleric will go on once dead he will stop so will the chairman of a charity that funnels money to jihad so will the senior intelligence officer who trains or smuggles them the predicator who incites the madrasa or university professor who brainwashes the prince who lies for terror the ayatollah who sends out teams of killers etc
7918758 jihad is the operative ideology of a number of states states can be pinned down and hit this approach is a variant of the notion of decapitation or of the formulation of nodal targeting given by air power theorist col john warden less than the jihadi hardware it is the jihadi software that has to be hit but not by soft power
7918759 one martyr will have followers ten martyrs will be admired and emulated
7918760 you cannot make a martyr out of him since this is what he wants
7918761 jihad is integral to islam and derives from its most fundamental tenets
7918762 applying high tempo attrition and nodal targeting to the jihadi apparatus worldwide by which i emphatically do not mean terrorists alone or even in the first place seems to me to be a modern equivalent it is those who deploy the undead who must be the priority targets
7918763 with the interest rate still on the low side and concerns over the local political scenario have encouraged investors to cut their holdings in the ringgit
7918764 the group also expects growth to come from higher usage of our bulking facilities in port klang which contributed rm42 2 million to our revenue last year as well as government contracts in the manufacturing division to print security documents such as passports and road tax

7918769 weve also noticed a shift within our own clientele the investment sales composition for capital protected products increased from 13 per cent last year to 70 per cent this august
7918770 while customers are taking a more defensive strategy when investing now they also want products that address the inflation experienced on their savings or deposits
7918771 if that level gets broken we might see prices decline further to find some support around rm2 350
7918772 however the market was relatively quiet as most buyers stayed on the sidelines hoping for the prices to reduce further
7918773 the price now averages at rm2 400 a tonne for every rm100 a tonne drop the group is going to lose about rm200 million in net profit

7918934 many british citizens hold sacred and take for granted their freedom to worship which makes the uk one of the most tolerant and respected societies in the world however this could all change if the government successfully introduces laws that make it more difficult for ministers of religion from outside the eu to enter the uk to address their congregations it is worrying if the government successfully introduces these restrictions without people knowing what is happening and being aware of the implications
7918935 religious thought transcends national borders and most religions including christian faiths islam judaism buddhism hinduism and more regularly invite learned elders to join them in the uk for prayer and guidance young religious people are also invited to extend their understanding of the uk and its populace the new laws to restrict ministers of religion coming here will affect every religion in the uk
7918936 it begs the question does the government intend to exercise this new power after going to the effort of introducing it for example might they invoke their new right to refuse sponsorship of ministers of religion maybe catholics who disagree too loudly with abortion laws or islamic preachers who oppose uk foreign policies could find their sponsors unable to invite them to the uk this would of course be a worrying curtailment of our right to worship and one everybody needs to question
7918937 ministers of religion have never previously been required to report to a pre approved sponsor who must be based in the uk
7918938 one catholic priest summed it up when he said we have one sponsor and one boss
7918939 freedom to worship should be encouraged and barriers should not be erected for those who wish to lead us in prayer the idea of making money out of those who sponsor religious leaders is the lowest of the low even for this government
7918940 when and why will the first ministers be refused entry i hope the government doesnt attempt to quote radical extremism as its reasoning behind any such action as restricting worship in the uk is in itself quite radical and extreme

7918974 most of what we are getting today is that ice is focusing on jones county but havent had calls from all areas we have had calls from chicken plants in and around laurel we had expected the raids to occur at chicken plants it was a surprise its a different industry howard industries gets state and federal funding to operate
7918975 that there is a group mobilizing forces from across the country and amassing exotic weapons that they refuse to disclose to the public they have a record of inflicting violence on unarmed civilians and illegally spying on citizens working toward positive change they even dress in black they are the denver police and the various local state and federal forces that will be transforming denver into a miniature version of the occupation of iraq when the dnc comes to town
7918976 about the kind of events they would like to see in the park
7918977 the construction has generated amazing levels of dirt and noise the area is continuously dusty getting into peoples homes onto their belongings and covering their windows at one point rats escaping from a demolition on the site ran openly down wood lane and into the surrounding streets its been pretty miserable for most local residents i dont think westfield has been a good neighbour i am taking up this matter with them
7918978 last year westfield sent us six chocolate truffles which they said was a

7918980 whilst i would be willing to give careful consideration to any specific request for reimbursement of costs genuinely incurred by any individual resident who has suffered particular difficulties with garden waste collection i do not think it likely that many residents will have suffered more than minor inconvenience
7918981 friends 20 years ago london hosted a historic concert which called for our freedom your voices carried across the water to inspire us in our prison cells far away

7918997 they dont even bother to pick it up on the specified days i saw that someone had left neatly bundled bags about 8 or 10 of garden waste round a tree a little way down the road and three weeks later it was still there of course spilling out of the bags onto the pavement i rang up only to be told a that they should not be left round a tree b i was then accused of leaving them there
7918998 i registered with the scheme this year since registering admittedly only four weeks ago my garden waste has not been picked up this week one of the bags was caught in the wind and blown into the street where it was emptied over the road by passing cars when i got home from work i had to go and sweep it all up and bag it again ive not had trouble getting thru on the green line and they are always pleasant and helpful but the service itself is rubbish in environmental terms its also a completely ridiculous idea i imagine a lot of people unwilling or unable to pay the charge are now black bagging their green waste and putting it out for the bin men alternatively as you say its being dumped in the street when it was a free service white bags lined the street on collection day now theyre a rare sight garden waste is obviously going somewhere else
7918999 in the past two weeks we have put out our bags in vain last thursday the red bag collection picked up a neighbours transparent garden waste bag which still remained on the pavement from tuesday like ours but ours was not removed ours stayed on the pavement until today but has not been taken
7919000 it would be nice if they actually collected the waste they frequently fail to collect from us the fact is that we have paid and are entitled to the service
7919001 convincing evidence has been presented to show the accused is guilty of murder and attempted murder in accordance with the charges
7919002 in order to determine if there are medical grounds to sentence the defendant to penal psychiatric care or if she committed the acts while affected by serious mental illness the court orders a psychiatric evaluation of her
7919003 had not got over the split from him still had feelings for him and was hurt that he was living as a family with emma jangestig and her children
7919004 i know that in india throwing rubbish out of a window and total disregard for the cleanliness of a public area is normal behaviour and i dare say a number would change behaviour if firmly told that in london this is not acceptable behaviour
7919005 this was a hastily written ill thought out stupid personal email
7919006 contradict what both the tory run council and lu said to residents and shopkeepers at the time
7919007 it is metronets view that the escalators can be replaced whilst maintaining station operation
7919008 closure is unlikely to be granted due to the weak business case involved
7919009 there is huge anger in shepherds bush at the way lu and the tory council forced this through local shops have lost business and many of my constituents have been unnecessarily messed around all seemingly to fit with the needs of the new shopping centre
7919010 i note from the evidence of councillor nandy that this is a community under strain i found her evidence about this particularly compelling and convincing i agree with councillor nandy and chief inspector overstall that despite the best efforts of the applicant it is not possible to control a very large crowd dispersing at a time when public transport is not readily available
7919011 leadership and management is vision led and driven by the outstanding leadership of the headteacher and a senior leadership team which is strong
7919012 hurlingham and chelsea is a good and rapidly improving school with outstanding features
7919013 all the boroughs secondary schools will get a sixth form
7919014 i support georgias territorial integrity but exclusively within its natural historic and cultural borders and hence i favor the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia or at least the recognition of their right to self determination
7919015 the european countries that oppose south ossetia and abkhazias independence they seized kosovo by force of arms recognized its independence and guarantee it by military occupation
7919016 president george w bush declared that that georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected this means that abkhazia and south ossetia cannot secede but when the serbian government demanded respect for its territorial integrity and qualified kosovos independence as a violation of international law it was told that a nation has the right to determine its own destiny
7919017 got punched in the stomach and got kind of nauseated looking
7919018 now is the time to settle the transdnestr problem there is a good opportunity to do it
7919019 russia is ready to apply all efforts to resolve the transdnestr crisis once and for all
7919020 even if one g7 country halts exports to russia they should bear in mind that most transnational companies have operations in other countries such as china which is likely to preserve economic relations with russia in any case
7919021 there is nothing the west can do let them try it for gods sake theyll bring sanctions upon themselves we could cut off their gas for starters
7919022 russians will probably face a cooler attitude top leaders included they could complicate visa applications but they couldnt divest all capital because the profit rate is too high
7919023 it is more important to take into account political risks than economic ones when operating outside the country
7919024 the unequal agreements mostly concern russias meat market in particular chicken meat russia accepted unfavorable accession conditions giving the united states over 74 of poultry meat quotas as a result the poultry meat market is oversaturated with an excessive share of imports from the u s
7919025 this does not suit russian producers because poultry meat prices in the russian market are unjustifiably low whereas production costs have grown over the past year
7919026 we have worked with russia and we have been an advocate for russias entry into the world community we have welcomed them into the group of the leading industrial nations we welcomed russias desire to join the world trade organization they are putting all that at risk
7919027 the united states has broadly hinted that it might reciprocate to moscows policy by freezing its accession to the wto why then should russia honor its agreements
7919028 i dont think this decision will have a major influence on russias macroeconomics its economic model is based on commodities export which is not regulated by wto norms
7919029 they often made unacceptable requests to us at the talks
7919030 if the west really wanted to integrate russia into the global economy the country would have long been accepted to the organization
7919031 our wto accession chances were dim before the military conflict in the caucasus in part because americans refused to cancel the jackson vanik amendment in addition ukraine has joined the wto which promised difficult accession talks with it even before the war georgia refused to approve russias accession and our changes plummeted to zero when the conflict began
7919032 but this tender will largely depend on the sellers attitude that of the austrian government and on political considerations
7919033 the austrians would not opt for big time bidders lufthansa and air france klm which simply want to corner the market from austrian airlines rather than develop the company and its hub in vienna
7919034 we have looked into all the political risks of a possible deal
7919035 and are sure the situation surrounding georgia is unlikely to affect the austrian governments choice

7919060 reforms are needed to ensure that indigenous peoples are better able to exercise their right of self determination within the framework of a brazilian state that is respectful of diversity
7919061 it is evident that indigenous peoples frequently do not control the decisions that affect their everyday lives and their lands even when their lands have been officially demarcated and registered because of invasions and mining by outsiders and other factors
7919062 while culturally rich indigenous peoples remain impoverished economically without sufficient power or opportunities to develop on a sustainable basis are continually suffocated by discrimination
7919063 a national campaign of education on indigenous issues and respect for diversity guided by the government in partnership with indigenous peoples and with the support of the news media would likely help build bridges of mutual understanding
7919064 our new executive team for the embassy suites san marcos hotel spa and conference center is especially equipped to meet the needs of the growing group business
7919065 the team members diverse experience from within and outside the region in depth understanding of the meetings and convention business and ability to deliver exceptional service down to the smallest of details will ensure immediate success

7919068 this council believes that hammersmith and fulhams residents should be able to view all of the debates at the full council meetings broadcast via a video link on the lbhf website youtube and other open access media this should be streamed live and available as a podcast the council believes that the public have a right to witness what their elected representatives say and vote for and that this council is obliged to make it easier for residents to do so we resolve to have this accomplished within six months of this being voted through

7919076 under the syrian constitution a defendant is innocent until proven guilty the prosecution cannot be excused from presenting proof of guilt unless the intention of the court is to convict regardless
7919077 the authorities want to show that theyre providing a semblance of judicial fairness for high profile opposition figures but this a politicised trial par excellence
7919078 it is in the interest of unity and in the interest of labor relations and in the interest of all of those many many thousands of people who work in the hotel industry that this matter could be resolved quickly we are confident that the court would address it and we are satisfied that we would get justice before the courts
7919079 we need a place where people can have a discussion and get information

7919090 for that reason any new egyptian attempt to mediate the dispute is doomed to failure
7919091 this is primarily due to the fact that cairo doesnt want to see hamas become a successful example of islamic governance in the region
7919092 as it now stands egypt is completely biased towards fatah which itself has a close relationship with israel
7919093 both hamas and pa president mahmoud abbas were elected by the palestinian people in 2006
7919094 egypts national interest requires neutrality and the avoidance of taking sides
7919095 the egyptian government is taking part in the siege and forbidding the entry of material aid into the starving territory
7919096 the egyptian regime itself is facing domestic instability and this has an impact on the effectiveness of its foreign policy

7919217 it would be totally ineffective and would result in bureaucratic chaos it would just result in more buildings standing empty and everyones against that at least here in amsterdam and in other big dutch cities
7919218 of course i dont condone some of the things which have taken place but youve got to go carefully what do you want to achieve with this law is it just about getting a few squatters in prison and meanwhile allowing the number of empty buildings in our big cities to increase again because thats what will happen
7919219 after six months premises would have to be reported as being empty when the local council would propose new tenants for example students thats a good idea but give us the proper tools to do that with real sanctions for the owners because 7 500 euro fines cannot be compared to hefty prison sentences for squatters as far as im concerned theres no parity there

7919225 why does the western world always believe that only our
7919226 canada has the same prudish attitude as australia i am a 71 year old woman and am amazed at this story the photo is sweet and in no way revealing or pornographic a punitive culture causes more harm than this wonderful image of innocence and targets well meaning open minded people who simply appreciate creativity or contribute to it
7919227 the cover photo was used expressly to provoke reaction in light of the recent bill henson controversy and as such was a deliberate poke in the eye to the people who agitated against the photographs professor nelson seems to think that because his child has given consent and that her mother took the photograph then this makes the publication of the photograph acceptable he doesnt seem to realize that it is the publication for public view of a naked child in an adult situation that is the problem not the photographs of naked children in normal family situations created for private display on mantelpieces i agree that there is nothing wrong with seeing children naked but this is all about situation and context would prof nelson like to see his child naked on the stage or in a commercial movie in an adult context as to showing a childs innocence any professional photographer should be able to demonstrate innocence without the child actually being naked if they cant then they are in the wrong profession
7919228 radio netherlands has incorrectly reported that bill hensons exhibition in sydney was cancelled this is not true the police temporarily removed a number of controversial photographs involving young children to determine whether child protection laws had been breached the police returned the works a few days later when they decided that charges could not be laid as the artist had not formed an intent to commit a crime at no stage was the entire exhibition closed radio netherlands should verify information before going to air
7919229 we reported that the opening of bill hensons exhibition was cancelled police returned 39 pictures more than two weeks after raiding the gallery the gallery later exhibited the pictures by appointment only
7919230 because i work for an internet company i quickly realised that a lot of the western media misunderstood the protests in tibet i have travelled in tibet and day to day life there is peaceful and calm when there were free tibet demonstrations during the olympic torch relay in paris and london i was terribly angry about it especially when i read how the western media were reporting it but i did not know how to express my anger we chinese learn at a young age not to show our emotions so we wear these clothes to express our feelings
7919231 whenever i visit china i was always overwhelmed by chinese chauvinism they simply have no tolerance accepting negative opinions or harsh criticism against their country that is they regard those dissenters as idiots i am very concerned about the situation in china including the crackdown in tibet china being world champion of the death penalty oppression against falun gong internet censorship and increasing numbers of prisoners of conscience however chinese patriots are uninterested in above mentioned problems because it is quite difficult to get suitable information on those issues because of censorship and punishment
7919232 please joost chinese chauvinism was instigated by the imperialistic western media china in 1989 trusted every word western media said then what happened thanks to modern technology we know about western hypocrisy a lot better now its the west that has failed the chinese but most people in china are still friendly to western er s unlike me living and educated in the west i have developed a great resentment due to the constant never ending china bashing in the media its not even really about human rights or freedom or democracy thats all bs because most china bashing reports dont know what they talking about its the sinister dishonesty that has triggered my resentment often the reports dont bother fact checking the irony is chinese like me in the west are more anti west because we have all found that the so called pro tibet human rights concern is only a cover for racism and imperialism
7919233 i think it would be nice if we used the invisibility cloaking on submarines as an observation aid see sea life in their natural state without disturbing them researchers could observe animals like wolves who shy away from all human contact in their natural settings and wouldnt a trip to the african savannah be even more exciting if the animals came so close to the jeep because they couldnt see it you could find yourself face to face with a lion and the lion wouldnt know you were there except for your smell of course
7919234 if at last science has made invisibility a reality then i think it can be used for the benefit of mankind here on earth there is a hatred of the masses on account of body skin colour if the metamaterial a mixture of metals and synthetic fibres no more than a few nanometres thick can be applied to all of the human race then hatred on the basis of colour would go away forever thereby bringing love among fellowmen and women on earth
7919235 there is considerable debate about performing repair permissions as part of regular maintenance
7919236 repairing permissions has gained the undeserved status of a magic incantation that can fix anything and some recommend it as part of regular maintenance while it can be a useful troubleshooting step we do not regard it as part of regular maintenance it will not hurt anything it merely wastes time when run unnecessarily however it is still a good idea to repair permissions after installing third party software
7919237 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that homo sapiens were more advanced than neanderthals
7919238 it is time for archaeologists to start searching for other reasons why neanderthals became extinct while our ancestors survived
7919239 technologically speaking there is no clear advantage of one tool over the other when we think of neanderthals we need to stop thinking in terms of stupid or less advanced and more in terms of different

7919264 they are the most affluent lot among real estate buyers in india showing interest in buying large chunks of land in their home country they are not affected by the current slowdown as they take a long range view of the whole scenario they have faith in the domestic economy and firmly believe that the prices will appreciate by at least 10 to 15 percent every year they see the downturn as an opportunity to invest in large chunks of land or even developed areas which they get at a good discount from even the top developers
7919265 according to our assessment the interest from nris has increased almost by 20 25 percent every quarter which is almost two to two anda half times in the last two to three years interestingly not just investors from the gulf countries but even from uk and usa have shown interest
7919266 many nris in the us and uk are not as confident as before of sanctity of their employment while others are disturbed by negative economic patterns across developed countries they see greater potential for india overcoming the current economic setbacks sentimental attachment to their country of origin is another reason
7919267 the gulf nri is one who is bound to return nris are looking for decent returns and might think of holding property here while investors from uk and us are pure investors nris mostly have an affinity to the areas they come from

7919270 we expect the population of russia to shrink by 32 million people to about 110 million that means russia will lose about a quarter of its population to sustain its economy russia increasingly will have to look elsewhere for workers some of them will be immigrant russians coming from the former soviet states what the russians call the near abroad but there arent enough of them to make up that population loss others will be chinese and non russians from the caucasus central asia and elsewhere potentially aggravating russias already uneasy racial and religious tensions

7919281 without the internet my life is unimaginable it gives me feelings of being a dweller of the stone age if all of a sudden i were to quit use of the internet but like radio television or telephone or cars and microwave ovens the internet is not going to go away so i think of making best of it rather than thinking about living without it
7919282 a lot of thrill and interactivity is attached with the world online so it really is painful to perceive life without the internet
7919283 when i am disconnected i attend to those assignments that otherwise keep piling up in the in tray waiting for my attention and i keep jotting down things and thoughts what i would do when online
7919284 i have always been going to my village to refresh my urban attitudes but going has become greatly difficult since i have put my work and life on the internet and it is no only me no it professional can afford to live without continuous connectivity one of the reasons is that others assume it people as on call every time
7919285 me and every one in my circle presence on the internet seems to be defining social circles groans and grumbles when ever there is a disruption in connectivity and there are so many
7919286 the first thing i do is to ring one or two isps and inquire then i ask my friends before i decide what to do one has to run around if there is a hardware or software problem that needs a repair or reinstallation in our country you can do nothing in case of electric failures telephone line disruptions or isp maintenance problem even respective departmental inquiry stations and help lines will not tell you what is happening
7919287 after ascertaining the cause i look for alternatives to remain online till things are back to normal at my own work station
7919288 the usage of the internet mainly depends on what sort of work one is doing i have internet exclusively available to me at work as well as home for my newspaper job use of the net was essential for me i would logon and remain online more though i never was a freak my present job as the assistant manager image marketing does not require active use of the net i only need to go online every now and then for a short duration to download my emails fire off replies weed out spam to keep the inbox under limits exchange hello hi with friends if i can could catch someone online or to surf any specific site and look for particular information life never stops for me if i am disconnected or do not go online for days after all people had been living working and communicating even before ibm launched the personal computer no

7919316 but a more interesting and wide ranging question is whether designing videogame environments is not something of a missed opportunity for todays architecture studios after all how might architects relay complex ideas about space landscape and the design of new terrains if they were to stop using academic essays and even project renderings and turn instead to videogames it seems like you can take your ideas about terrain deformation and instant landscapes and nomadic geology and you can license it to lucasarts knowing that tens of thousands of people will soon be interacting with your ideas all over the world or you can just pin some images up on the wall of an architecture class make no money at all and be forced to get a job rendering buildings for frank gehry so would more people understand rem koolhaass thoughts on cities if he stopped writing 1000 page books and started designing videogames games set in some strange quasi asiatic desert world of koolhaasian urbanism or do all of these questions simply mistake popularity for engaged comprehension

7919583 na verdade o senhor calabote deu se ao luxo de redigir o mais falso de todos os boletins de todos os jogos de futebol
7919584 o jogo principiou s 15h e a 1 parte terminou s 15 45
7919585 a mais sensacional mentira do ano com a gravante de ter sido num documento oficial

7919590 o sr inoc ncio calabote foi demitido de rbitro por motivos ligados ao prolongamento do jogo benfica cuf como do conhecimento p blico esse jogo principiou cerca de dez minutos depois da hora marcada e teve um prolongamento de cinco ou seis minutos tanto o atraso como o prolongamento n o constituem em si mesmos nfima mat ria de culpa o erro do sr calabote consistiu em pretender convencer nos contra as evid ncidas dos factos de que principiara o encontro s 15h precisas e de que o prolongara por dois minutos apenas aqui nesta atitude escudada e incompreens vel que o antigo rbitro eborense deixa de merecer a confian a do p blico e da cca

7919594 os benfiquistas obrigaram me a trabalho intenso e confesso que tive de realizar v rias defesas em condi es dif ceis quanto ao resultado considero o expressivo em demasia visto que nele interferiu o desacerto da arbitragem
7919595 n o posso acreditar no que se diz a respeito de gama e embora n o seja seu costume falhar tantas jogadas creio na sua honestidade
7919596 vendo isso e ainda porque dois dos seus pr prios companheiros me solicitaram que alterasse o desempenho posto mandei o sair do terreno estava muito nervoso e manifestava sintomas de total desorienta o todavia da a aventarem se torpes insinua es ter de percorrer se larga dist ncia
7919597 calcule que nesta semana n o pudemos realizar um treino de conjunto com todos os nossos jogadores faltaram nos o hern ni o arcanjo e o barbosa os tr s em lisboa por causa da selec o militar eu compreendo os interesses da selec o mas numa altura destas de campeonato com um jogo decisivo para a tribui o do t tulo evidentemente uma dificuldade que nos foi criada
7919598 para n s o jogo de torres vedras inicia se com 4 golos do torriense ou come ando com 0 4 o fcp tem de ganhar o jogo ao ataque ser a palavra de ordem e se conseguirmos superar aquela margem seremos campe es
7919599 dupla tristeza dos jogadores do torriense porque na maioria os jogadores al m da fuga ao ltimo lugar tamb m desejariam que o campe o se chamasse benfica
7919600 nitidez da falta tornou bizarra a decis o do rbitro mandando prosseguir o jogo e ignorando a grande penalidade que se impunha assinalar
7919601 e os jogadores locais sorriam quando em tal lhes falava que havia um pr mio de cinco mil escudos para cada um no caso de conseguirem empatar ou pelo menos sofrer poucos golos
7919602 no meu ltimo jogo ia dando uma vit ria ao benfica e n o o consegui o que lamento como benfiquista o porto talvez seja a equipa que pratica melhor futebol mas n s pod amos ter dado o campeonato ao benfica paci ncia como homem do benfica sinto muito que assim n o fosse
7919603 o porto venceu mal a arbitragem foi nitidamente favor vel aos nortenhos
7919604 pensava em ganhar mas nunca julguei que custasse tanto e j agora um segredo quando soube que o benfica entrara em campo mais tarde 10 minutos para saber do nosso resultado confesso que desanimei e julguei tudo perdido sabe o que nos valeu termos marcado muito tarde o segundo e terceiro golos lamento a maneira como os torreenses se portaram connosco mas tiveram o pago os jogadores e o p blico acenando nos com len os a 10 minutos do fim lament vel

7919620 o benfica entrou em campo com mais de 5 minutos de atraso algu m perto de n s alvitrou tratar se de um estratagema com o fim de manter o p blico e os jogadores ao corrente do que se passava em torres vedras por essa ou outra raz o o certo que ainda o jogo n o tinha come ado e j um longo sussurro de sofrimento percorria as bancadas o porto j est a ganhar por 1 0 mas n o era verdade os portadores de aparelhos de r dio apressaram se a desfazer o descoroa ante boato e desfeito o acabrunhamento do terr vel pesadelo as turbas tornaram a erguer se fren ticas clamando benfica benfica benfica e foi como se a equipa encarnada tivesse marcado o seu primeiro golo antes de se dar o primeiro pontap na bola e quem poder contar os dramas ntimos de cada um as l grimas que n o puderam chorar se os gritos de dor que ficaram represados nos peitos quem poder apreciar medir descrever a tristeza daquele lento arrastado quase l gubre debandar do est dio da luz

7919945 the personhood amendment could be something that gets social conservatives out to vote
7919946 a kind of 1930s style conflict between unions and management
7919947 i dont think you could just win with only union voters
7919948 did george bush carry colorado in 2004 because of voter initiatives probably not
7919949 faultless online shopping experience thats well thought out and executed
7919950 tried to evict squirrels from the house by playing guitar really loudly
7919951 luxury goods are the only area in which it is possible to make luxury margins
7919952 taking action on what you know puts you ahead of the majority of your peers many know how to attract publicity for instance but just let that knowledge sit when you not only take action but do it well youll find yourself way way ahead of colleagues ignoring all the usual excuses may be the most powerful step you take
7919953 they made america from the steam engine to the search engine
7919954 stom stuk vreten eieren op bruin brood hoe haal je het in je harses hierrrrr
7919955 one of the things you have to be careful about is that the athletes are supremely driven
7919956 somebody did a poll in sydney at the 2000 summer olympics they asked the athletes there is a drug that guarantees you a gold medal but you will be dead in five years fifty percent said they would take it
7919957 i am there to help them but i must also be an advocate to make sure they dont make decisions that will hurt them in the long term we have to be that sober second thought which is not easy for them my responsibility is to the individual not the team
7919958 for example i had an individual with a torn meniscus we could have repaired but by repairing it they couldnt be in the olympics because of the rehab so they chose not to have it repaired which puts them at increased risk of arthritis
7919959 i felt uncomfortable with that but they ended up winning a medal if that athlete hadnt won a gold medal i would have had more second guessing
7919960 the number one reason athletes felt they could not reach top performance is they couldnt get the best sleep
7919961 its intense and grueling its hard financially and culturally theyre away from their families we hope to reduce the feeling of burnout
7919962 when you are going onto the world stage like this in a time where there are a lot of high emotions a number of different crises you worry about safety and security
7919963 if you have lots of supplies available and a low number of casualties you can give one type of care but if you have low services and a mass casualty incident you have to consider who will have the greatest chance at survival
7919964 well get used to the heat with no pollution and without the chaos the frenzy that will be in beijing
7919965 the problem is as people finish events they change into a party mode we insist strongly that canadian athletes have to be on their best behaviour not to disrupt other athletes its party time to some degree for young athletes but theyre aware of the stresses and we tell them to expect the unexpected
7919966 you have to go there with that attitude you expect difficulty sleeping or transporting or your cleats are stolen two hours before your race
7919967 but it was great walking into the stadium it gave me chills
7919968 obviously we are a bit concerned about the weather and air quality and we have tried to prepare for it a bit but the beijing officials are trying to do something about the pollution alternating licence plates on alternate days and shutting down factories
7919969 knowing the air quality might be a problem we are making sure our athletes with asthma or exercise induced asthma are being tested and people who have a family history of asthma and high risk people are getting tested in canada
7919970 as you can see its a tough job but i like it
7919971 but as a physician it doesnt matter what the nationality of the athletes im treating is
7919972 i think the chinese have a very different culture and theyre trying to expose themselves to the world through the games
7919973 i was in beijing in 2001 for the world university games and there have been huge changes to the city in the course of seven years so it will be interesting to see exactly whats gone on
7919974 the group of doctors that ill be working with is the best at what they do
7919975 when you put everyone together youve got a lot of skill and connecting with your colleagues to swap stories and knowledge is great
7919976 i never dreamed that medicine would take me to these places each has been a unique experience
7919977 i have some very special recollections many of them tie to magical performances at the 76 olympics in montreal
7919978 it was such an unbelievable setting as a doctor youre in the midst of it and you get to see sports men and women up close
7919979 that will be an ever present factor at the games
7919980 if you turn up for a game and the pollution index is pretty high
7919981 there are a large number of athletes who may begin experiencing respiratory problems that they never knew they had
7919982 its not heavy physical work but its long hours we typically open the clinic at 7 00am and close at 11 00 or 11 30 at night and then theres more work to do administrative work and emails and such
7919983 you get breaks at supper and lunch and most days i try to get out for a half hour exercise break
7919984 as the games get bigger if an athlete is in distress its not always easy to figure out how to be there
7919985 at their time of need you might get blocked by a security agent which is ironic because youve come across the whole world to be there with the athlete
7919986 one of the pleasures is getting to know people from other countries medical crews over the years and helping each other out
7919987 ive received some emails already from people saying theyre going to beijing looking forward to seeing you
7919988 quite often we have a mixer with other medical staff in the evening to get to know them better
7919989 but it was great walking into the stadium it gave me chills
7919990 when i think back to the boycott in 1980 the canadians traded more wheat with russia that year than in previous years
7919991 i personally wish there was greater separation between politics and sport the canadian olympic committee never considered boycotting this year we told the athletes the olympics is not the place for that
7919992 i work with a lot of teams now and i live vicariously through them
7919993 there is a sense it is once in a lifetime for the athlete the anxiety level goes up from the athletes to the coaches and support staff to make sure everything is right that the athlete is healthy and ready to go
7919994 its hard work i dont relax until the games are over
7919995 they have long hours and feel they are on duty constantly
7919996 we are preparing for the worst but i am optimistic it will not be that bad
7919997 even if the air is compromised its not really a health issue it may be uncomfortable and some people can get exacerbations of asthma though i personally feel when we get to the games it will not be as bad as past times weve been to beijing ive been there when you could see the building across the street but nothing behind it this is a very important event for the chinese and they have spent an enormous amount of money to clean up the air and have made great strides
7919998 it is the same as any field of human endeavour
7919999 there are people who are not honest on their taxes every year there will always be people who cheat and its the same with doping a small percentage will always be cheating
