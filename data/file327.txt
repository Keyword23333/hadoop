3270007 a few people said it was a shame we didnt have the outdoor food and entertainment at meyerhoff we might reinstate that but there was very little money coming in from that in past years

3270036 the client has since written an apology to myself and the whole of the team and i know that the company in question has dealt with it in the serious nature that it is
3270037 i believe that theyve done everything that i would expect from a company to ensure that they take the right necessary action
3270038 its just frustrating because we knew straight away it was a false alarm but of course we had to go into full evacuation mode

3270086 against the backdrop of a challenging operating environment st george continues to perform well with strong growth across its core businesses and product lines sound asset quality and effective cost control
3270087 energy research is a strength of this university cerpa is pulling together all these ideas into something that is interdisciplinary but still excellent within each of those disciplines
3270088 what distinguishes us from other research centres is our combination of understanding the technology and being able to relate it to real world policies and solutions
3270089 by combining our diverse research strengths we have the potential to come up with new approaches to problems and new technologies

3270094 i am extremely delighted and proud to hear today that you have realised the dream of a billion indians by winning the olympic gold medal in the 10 metre air rifle at beijing
3270095 your achievement is even greater as india has not won a gold at the olympics after a very long gap of 28 years but also because you have become the first ever indian to win a gold medal at the olympics in an individual event
3270096 your achievement should inspire confidence amongst all indian sportspersons that they can achieve of any sport it will inspire our youth to take up sports as a full time career i wish him well for the future
3270097 brands which want to showcase their indian ness or national pride like a tata steel or maruti could be interested in him now
3270098 he is good looking and speaks well he is young so he could attract youth centric products such as say clothing apparel watches and eye wear
3270099 the evidence that we have shows that your excessive consumption of alcohol was a contributing factor in the incident
3270100 when i read the cica letter i just had no words i could not take it in
3270101 it felt like i was being punished for having the audacity to step up and say i dont think this should have happened to me
3270102 it was like going back to the 70s saying she was asking for it
3270103 interestingly alzheimer s disease pathology was associated with physical frailty in older persons both with and without dementia
3270104 the level of frailty was approximately two times higher in a person with a high level of ad pathology compared with a person with a low level of ad pathology
3270105 together both of these studies suggest that frailty can be an early indicator of alzheimer s disease pathology and may appear before memory loss
3270106 a general message from amphibians is that we may have little time to stave off a potential mass extinction
3270107 an ancient organism which has survived past extinctions is telling us that something is wrong right now
3270108 we humans may be doing fine right now but they are doing poorly the question really is whether well listen before its too late
3270109 my father wants me to learn mandarin so that it will be easy for me to get a job in the future
3270110 it can be quite lonely i cant wait for the school term to end
3270111 i was posted here two and a half years ago it is difficult to describe how i felt when i first reported for duty

3270113 we may have the smallest number of students but we still function like any other school
3270114 in conclusion we provide evidence that a metabolically benign obesity can be identified and that it may protect from insulin resistance and atherosclerosis
3270115 furthermore our data suggest that ectopic misplaced fat accumulation in the liver may be more important than visceral fat in the determination of such a beneficial phenotype in obesity
3270116 among u s adults 20 years and older 23 5 percent approximately 16 3 million adults of normal weight adults were metabolically abnormal whereas 51 3 percent approximately 35 9 million adults of overweight adults and 31 7 percent approximately 19 5 million adults of obese adults were metabolically healthy
3270117 these data show that a considerable proportion of overweight and obese u s adults are metabolically healthy whereas a considerable proportion of normal weight adults express a clustering of cardiometabolic abnormalities
3270118 like nature abhors vacuum we abhor the political vacuum that exists in pakistan
3270119 whether he is impeached or not is not important from the indian point of view it is for the people of pakistan to decide
3270120 but it leaves a big vacuum and we are deeply concerned about this vacuum because it leaves the radical extremist outfits with freedom to do what they like not merely on pak istan afghan border but clearly our side of the border too
3270121 an attack on indian embassy in a foreign land clearly marked an entirely new stage in the levels of acrimony and violence
3270122 therefore we expect something would be done than mere words manmohan singh did not raise his voice but left nobody in that room in any doubt on where he stood
3270123 we would expect that the political leadership would take some action against it either against rogue elements in it or an isi operating without control
3270124 given that this second pathway has been linked to cancer in other contexts we may need to consider the possibility that it is contributing to these tumors and alter our treatment goals accordingly
3270125 we wanted to know if we could blame this on ras protein activity so we generated new mice with normal levels of neurofibromin expression but increased levels of ras activation in brain stem cells however those mice were normal

3270136 we already know that ptks are associated with several types of aggressive cancers including colon breast and lung cancers
3270137 what we have discovered is that ptks have an important role to play as cancer cells grow and mutate to become potentially more aggressive tumours
3270138 the more we can learn about how tumours develop the more we are able to prevent their growth in the future
3270139 there are already drugs that inhibit particular ptks in the late stages of treatment our discovery could change the timing of when and how those or similar drugs are administered
3270140 our studies have shown that ptk pathways are intimately associated with the regulation of checkpoint responses during dna replication
3270141 we have identified one mechanism by which ptks may remain activated and allow cancer cells to bypass the molecular warden of dna replication they may lack a key enzyme called tcptp
3270142 i think the question of pressure has been answered i dont think that bothers him i think he feeds on it and uses it to his advantage

3270480 the confession of paternity is at present really the easiest way to legalise stay in the czech republic
3270481 we disagree with this it has never been stated that we must not sell the arms
3270482 poverty in czech conditions does not mean that children are hungry or that the shake of cold in shabby clothes but their access to education computers quality education after school activities developing their intellect spending holidays with parents outside their homes and going to schools in nature with their fellow pupils is difficult
3270483 georgia is incapable of conducting a prolonged war in principle given that georgia has failed to win the lightning war it has lost the war it is totally out of the question for nato troops to get involved european armies are terrified of losses and a war against russia is impossible as far as they are concerned
3270484 it is an important discovery for which teams the world over have been striving for several years already we are among the first who have succeeded in crystallising the protein and describing its mechanism
3270485 a part of the enzymes we study is a sort of engine it is unique in that it is capable of relocating dna to tow it as if on a rope across several thousand bases which is a huge distance in our terms
3270486 the slowdown in the czech economic growth is mainly due to domestic demand higher inflation which swallowed a larger part of a wage growth than in the previous years curbed household consumption
3270487 the economic growth is pulled by foreign trade instead which does not yet reflect the overly fast firming of the crowns rate and the slowdown of economic growth in the eurozone
3270488 investment activity is weakening just like consumer demand the sentiment in the economy is not good because of high prices
3270489 besides the outside environment does not bring anything good to the czech economy most of the worlds leading economies are on the verge of stagflation
3270490 originally we had expected a slowdown in the gdp growth below 4 5 percent for the second quarter of 2008 but we have raised the prediction to 4 8 percent in the light of the very strong foreign trade surplus in june
3270491 the czech republic should retain its position as one of the fastest growing european economies despite the slowdown and continue to converge with the eu average
3270492 gdp per head by purchasing power parity reached 81 5 percent of the eu average in the czech republic last year this year it could edge higher to 82 5 percent of the eu average
3270493 the second quarter was probably better than the first one but it does not change anything on the trend of economic slowdown the biggest risks remain abroad where economic outlooks are worsening considerably
3270494 the link with the protection of peoples health and safety is at least very doubtful
3270495 the european directive is wrong and its czech version is even worse so i cannot sign the law
3270496 truancy poses a great problem up to 50 percent of children under 15 have many hours of unexcused absence
3270497 we expect fuel prices will be around 15 hellers cheaper next week but then the prices should calm down
3270498 three years ago there was hunger for any kind of housing individuals as well as developers were feverishly preparing construction projects now that they have the permits and build new flats though the situation in the market has changed
3270499 people now have higher demands with respect to the flat interior the exterior of the whole project as well as the locality and services flats close to busy roads for instance are almost unsaleable
3270500 this sum combined with the growth in primary deposits will cover our expansion for the coming three years or more

3270506 but we could see a more positive reaction like the one after the results for the first quarter if the results are better again than is expected or if cez raises the estimate of full year profit

3270522 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3270523 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3270524 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3270525 were doing much better than we had anticipated in our original projections
3270526 its very good progress and we hope to do even better
3270527 we are still very concerned that there will be large numbers of persons who about a year ago filed to be naturalized and have yet to go through that process
3270528 without fully employing its abilities even at the final moment the imperial nation is surrendering before the enemies propaganda
3270529 i never imagined the torpor of the nations leaders and people
3270530 will come off as a complete loser by accepting unconditional surrender even if it makes a few demands
3270531 the purpose of the greater east asia war is to achieve a stable east asia for the survival and defence of the nation
3270532 the sacrifice of so many people who died in the war would go unrequited if this purpose remains unfulfilled
3270533 1944 the world holds its breath as it awaits d day
3270534 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3270535 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3270539 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3270544 although there are an awful lot of farms in illinois in the neighborhood where i live the main livestock is squirrels
3270545 so i dont pretend to know everything there is to know about agricultural issues
3270546 some of you noticed that this week i got into a debate with one of my colleagues who is also running for the presidency the debate was about whether or not we talk to world leaders even when you dont like them my theory is you do and you do it without preconditions
3270547 you can come and help me load hogs in the morning

3270550 were not even realizing what an incredible athlete he is
3270551 obviously hes amazing and he breaks all these world records but i think being a part of that we almost take it for granted
3270552 i want to do things that no one else in the sport has ever done
3270553 it will remain to be seen where history ultimately places him but clearly today he is the best swimmer weve seen
3270554 he was very active and never stopped moving and it was kind of hard to harness that at first
3270555 its a little bit counterintuitive because even though he was so rambunctious as a young swimmer when he raced he was very focused
3270556 i always had dreams of being an olympian being a world record holder being a professional athlete being a gold medallist and i had to focus on those goals to achieve them and i knew that
3270557 i think he missed out on a normal progression of things but i wouldnt say hes missed anything
3270558 i would say he would tell you what hes gained has been a lot better than what hes missed
3270559 i would never trade going to the olympic games and standing on top of the medal podium or being able to turn professional or travel all over the world i would never trade any of it in
3270560 there are a lot of things that people havent done and i want to change the sport and be the first person to do new things
3270561 i think with the quality we have got we are capable of being a top eight side looking at the play offs i would be disappointed if we are not there or thereabouts at the end of the season
3270562 we have some young players but a lot of them have two or three years experience at this level i think we are ready to challenge
3270563 im absolutely champing at the bit to get started i dont think i have ever looked forward to the start of a new season more than this because of the quality we have got in the squad
3270564 train wreck the end of the conservative revolution and not a moment
3270565 if we do attack it is going to be a disaster

3270580 we didnt have the geographic plant to equal client care
3270581 so we have tried to create an environment to ease some of that anxiety through timely care and care which has to be good
3270582 its about taking care of the patient when the patient needs to be taken care of
3270583 a huge difference for patients to me it should be the standard of care
3270584 i had never had anything happen to me so i was thinking should i be worried
3270585 once i got there i had the ultrasound done and they told me that i definitely had something there
3270586 dr gruen told me that if he was able to get the team together he could do it then and they did it
3270587 she says noting she expected it to be at least a week but by midday the next day friday the 13th she says she was on the phone with gruen who told her she was fine
3270588 all that obsessive dwelling you do with all that time
3270589 you can have a plan of action that much sooner
3270590 the key was to get all the biopsy care under one roof
3270591 at the end of the day all it meant was to say yes when you empower the people at work with saying yes the rest will take care of itself
3270592 when i first did mammograms there was no such thing as ultrasounds
3270593 it just started hurting and it was bothering my technique so i needed to get surgery
3270594 i feel a lot better i will be back pretty soon
3270595 i just have to get comfortable where i am that is the only thing slowing me down getting the flexibility back after the surgery
3270596 we have a lot of shifty guys fast guys that can make something happen
3270597 i heard he misses it so he wanted to come stay in a dorm again
3270598 i told him id like him to come spend a couple days visit and have him visit with the team here one of these nights before we leave
3270599 the thing i learned having been through it is it takes the same things to go there and lose that it took to go there and win
3270600 getting there is so hard everybody works hard you have to find a way to work harder everybody works smart you have to find a way to work a little smarter then you have to be lucky

3270605 step over here put that cigarette out you dont see the police officer trying to stop you or what or are you just stupid
3270606 saw him walking pulled up in front of him and jumped out said go to the front of the car and it was on like donkey kong after that and i wasnt holding back
3270607 for example green commander of fever will flash if you say it it works best if the word you use is 3 5 letters long
3270608 it looks like he may have had some type of medical event
3270609 hey so you seem verry well dressed whats the deal
3270610 anytime you have a preseason game you take the good and the bad
3270611 there are some things i dont think we did a good job on the blitz as they scored a touchdown
3270612 and there were a couple things where we just didnt have really good outside run support there are some good things too i take the good with the bad with that i just hate to see anybody take the ball down the field and score but it was a team that we hadnt worked on that much and it surprised us a little bit how they would run the ball that much am i disappointed the way we played sure that series
3270613 i think we had some problems last year and we kind of got away from that a little bit if it happens again yeah ill be worried but im not now just like we had a good opening drive offensively and almost took it down except for a penalty those things happen in the first game disappointed yeah but im not too concerned right now if it continues like that ill be disappointed
3270614 you cant ask anyone to make decisions for you because its just too heavy there is a lot of rush to treatment when what you really need is time to research and think about how you want to approach this take your time christina there is no rush use your cancer to learn and grow and as a force to work for you you will make it the success and drive you have had in your career will be the same strengths you will use to win over this nasty disease and i am here if you want to talk to someone who was there
3270615 my own people used to say to me you speak like a white woman what does that even mean anyway everyone has their way of speaking and living their life
3270616 no one should be judging and assuming that because im black i have to speak in that hip hop way thats something i prefer not to do

3270624 they are using half people karolyi said after the tiny chinese womens team grabbed a significant lead over the americans in team competition sunday night
3270625 one of the biggest frustrations is what arrogance these people think we are stupid
3270626 we are in the business of gymnastics and we know what a kid of 14 or 15 or 16 looks like he said
3270627 you dont have to be a gymnastics coach to know what they look like at 16
3270628 they understood it a 10 is perfect that is good for the sport what is this system they say it cannot be manipulated it can be manipulated
3270629 people always step up and do things out of the ordinary at the olympics
3270630 you have to win eight gold medals to get noticed he wins a gold medal and everyone says one down seven to go people have no idea how hard it is to get up on the blocks and swim out of his mind like that
3270631 whether he wins eight gold medals or not it wasnt going to be our responsibility for that to happen
3270632 we gave our best effort if we came up short hes not going to be looked at as a guy who was on a relay that lost or that he came up short nah hes an amazing athlete probably the best ever in this sport regardless of what happens here hes going to go down as that
3270633 i jumped in the air and almost fell in the pool
3270634 i was thinking if there was anybody on this team or in the world who could do it it would be jason who could pull this off i was pounding on the blocks saying aaaaah come on we looked up at the board and it was phenomenal i dont think anybody in the world could have done a better job without a doubt
3270635 we were the favorites in both of those years this year we were actually considered the underdogs in past olympics it just wasnt attainable theres no way i was going to catch a guy whos two seconds ahead of me
3270636 when i flipped at 50 meters and saw how far ahead he was and he was the world record holder until about two minutes before that the thought crossed my mind for a split second theres no way then i changed i said you know what this is ridiculous its the olympics im here for the united states of america i dont care how bad it hurts im going to go out in five seconds i was thinking all these things i got supercharged and just took it from there it was unreal
3270637 he got his hand on the wall and i got chills seeing their reactions and how happy they were
3270638 anybody who wants to beat me up for this they should have at it
3270639 the truth is you cant possibly beat me up more than ive already beaten myself up
3270640 i was taken in by his magnificent rhetoric and now i think hes treacherous
3270641 its an insult greater than i could ever imagine that he would do this to that magnificent family he has
3270642 he was trying to relieve himself of the horror of what he had done almost saying had i known that she was in the last stages of her life i would never have done it
3270643 what that demonstrates is that he had no love for his wife because you dont do that to someone you love he has soiled her
3270644 i dont think that candidates private lives are particularly relevant to how theyll perform in office
3270645 if we rated our presidents by the quality of their private lives youd have to say that nixon and bush are two of the best presidents we ever had
3270646 john edwards knows what the rules are he knew at the time he ran for president that he was having an affair and he should have known that was going to come out it was reckless for him to run for president under those terms i feel very disappointed in him his campaign the judgment he showed
3270647 it would have been better if hed issued an apology and just gone away
3270648 tarnishes the moral credibility hes built through his work on poverty and it also raises questions about his overall judgment
3270649 i was excited when i found out i was selected
3270650 ill go meet new people from all over the u s and work on my leadership skills and how to work with people
3270651 i just love to run and being outside with my friends
3270652 shes been saying she wants to be a doctor since she was 3
3270653 but really would just love to go and see for myself
3270654 never has there been an audience as friendly as this one
3270655 we have people come to this in costume and they look better than we do one guy came out in full armor a mom brought her two sons dressed as king arthur and patsy we can hear them saying the lines with us
3270656 cmon dean you really think these demons are gonna leave a trail
3270657 storms comin and you boys your daddy you are smack in the middle of it

3270659 geeez you kiss your mother with that mouth oooh thats right i forgot you dont
3270660 thats kind of a turn on you hitting a girl
3270661 he begged for his life with tears in his eyes
3270662 boy you and dad are alot more alike than i thought you know that you both cant wait to sacrafice yourselves for this thing but ya know what im gonna be the one to bury you
3270663 they probably know exactly what we look like too and they could look like anybody
3270664 you fight and you fight for this family but the truth is they dont need you not like you need them sam hes clearly johns favorite even when they fight its more concern than hes ever shown you

3270670 all government is evil and trying to improve it is largely a waste of time
3270671 we believe any decision at this time on whether he should remain majority leader is premature and wrong
3270672 this analysis was not undermined in any way by politicians

3270744 where the hell are you josh everyones waiting for you
3270745 well you better hurry the hell up or were leaving without you
3270746 yeah yeah hey i talked to this guy named metis do you know him
3270747 metis i have no freaking clue didnt your parents ever teach you not to talk to strangers
3270748 im serious josh whoever this guy is hes probably not worth your time i dont even know who he is
3270749 you wouldnt know him as anything else but a very hardworking but gentle person and i think you wouldnt really see too much influence except for him being a strong kind of quiet leader
3270750 being in a monastery he always felt that he didnt like labels on people because here he was a jew in a catholic monastery
3270751 she was bleeding internally and he actually came to the house
3270752 in a day when people dont make house calls he actually came to the house
3270753 its an extraordinary show theres nothing correct about it and it never apologises
3270754 i drink 12 flat whites with at least four sugars minimum every day
3270755 i guess you would say he was the chief financial officer for marmion
3270756 he was a precise man he was very good at it thats why he lasted all those years basically without being a full professional accountant he was an accountant
3270757 we were in the 7th grade when he said i think ill study to be a priest at that time you went on to study after the 8th grade
3270758 he was quite religious and he liked the benedictine family he always told me about this family thats what he called them his family
3270759 and he only recently retired from it he worked so many years doing it
3270760 he put in the whole budgeting systems with the abbey and the academy and he was a wizard with the impossible medicare records he took care of all the monks medicare records and social security he understood all that
3270761 er is een algehele militaire invasie van georgi aan de gang
3270762 ik denk dat de veiligheidsraad nu in actie moet komen
3270763 dan moet er worden ge mproviseerd en dat is nou niet het sterkste punt van de mensen hier
3270764 ik denk niet dat er nog veel speculatie zit in euro dollar en olieprijzen de positionering van hedge funds is in ieder geval neutraler geworden en spelers van het populaire koop olie verkoop banken gezelschapsspel zijn recent geslacht kortom de huidige koersen reflecteren de economische realiteit vrij goed
3270765 wat het ook zou wezen het is in ieder geval een koers die de werkelijke waarde niet weerspiegelt speculanten zorgen er mede voor dat markten effici nt functioneren wie kan mij verzekeren dat de koers van bijvoorbeeld olie niet naar 200 dollar gaat als short selling verboden wordt niemand
3270766 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull

3270769 de manier waarop ik de groep toesprak zal ik niet uit de doeken doen maar ik weet nu perfect wie mee verdrinkt als het schip zinkt en wie blijft vechten om te overleven
3270770 de spelers moeten begrijpen dat de inzet er altijd en overal moet zijn ook al draait de ploeg vierkant
3270771 ik ga ervan uit dat de spelers deze moeilijke periode overwinnen zonder boetes
3270772 ze moeten zelf beseffen dat ze hun plichten moeten nakomen
3270773 nu telt alleen een overwinning bij cercle goed voetbal is nu niet zo belangrijk maar ik wil wel inzet zien
3270774 niet alleen zaterdag wil ik scherpte zien de spelers moeten dat nu 34 wedstrijden tonen
3270775 wij als spelers hebben vooral gezwegen en geluisterd het was de eerste keer dat ik herman van holsbeeck kwaad heb gezien de muren op anderlecht hebben getrild
3270776 in gent konden michel louwagie en ivan de witte ook hard roepen maar dit kon ook tellen
3270777 alles wat er fout loopt hebben we besproken het kan zo echt niet verder
3270778 zes op zes tegen cercle en aa gent is een must veel mensen geloven niet meer dat anderlecht op dit moment nog twee matchen na elkaar kan winnen wij moeten het tegendeel bewijzen
3270779 nu verliezen in brugge kan echt niet dat past niet bij de traditie van deze club ook voor de fans moeten we winnen
3270780 zaterdagavond zagen we dat ze kwaad zijn maar dat is normaal ze kunnen niet aanvaarden dat er geen vechtlust is
3270781 of we frutos missen natuurlijk maar de coach heeft al veel dingen uitgeprobeerd we moeten een oplossing vinden want anders dreigt een grote crisis
3270782 en er moet niet alleen naar de verdediging gekeken worden verdedigen doe je net als aanvallen met elf
3270783 we mogen nu niet bang zijn maar opnieuw voetballen zoals in de terugronde van vorig seizoen
3270784 you dont really believe all that stuff in there do you
3270785 well what about that guy that was swallowed by that whale
3270786 oh jonah yes i believe that it is in the bible
3270787 well how do you suppose he survived all that time inside the whale
3270788 well i dont really know i guess when i get to heaven i will ask him
3270789 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3270790 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3270791 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3270792 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3270793 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3270794 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3270795 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3270796 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3270797 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3270798 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3270799 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3270800 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3270801 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3270802 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3270803 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3270804 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3270805 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3270806 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3270807 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3270808 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3270809 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3270810 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3270811 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3270812 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3270813 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3270814 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3270815 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3270816 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3270817 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3270818 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3270819 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3270820 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3270821 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3270822 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3270823 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3270824 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3270825 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3270826 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3270827 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3270828 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3270829 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3270830 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3270831 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3270832 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3270833 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3270834 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3270835 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3270836 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3270837 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3270838 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3270839 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3270840 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3270841 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3270842 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3270843 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3270844 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3270845 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3270846 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3270847 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3270848 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3270849 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3270850 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3270851 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3270852 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3270853 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3270854 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3270855 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3270856 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3270857 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3270858 who are open to doing something on the production side
3270859 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3270860 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3270861 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3270862 la licencia creative commons que tiene el corto lo permite siempre que el resultado de la adaptaci n tenga la misma licencia
3270863 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3270864 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3270865 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3270866 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3270867 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3270868 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3270869 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3270870 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3270871 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3270872 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3270873 get up off your sorry ass and start living forget everything youve been through and start right now today it took x number of years to get yourself in this mess do you think change will happen overnight do what you can do today
3270874 not having expectations of others and you wont be disappointed
3270875 like sands through the hourglass so are the days of our lives
3270876 in this case it was not the police that were setting mr read up to entice mr read to come over here to have sex with what he thought was a 15 and a 17 year old girl
3270877 in my experience ive never encountered this where an estranged wife has been the one that set up the sting
3270878 he acknowledged that he came over based on the text messages that were sent to him to have sex with a 15 and 17 year old girl
3270879 the air and artillery bombardment left the provincial capital without water food electricity and gas horrified civilians crawled out of the basements into the streets as fighting eased looking for supplies
3270880 it all confirms our numerous warnings addressed to the international community that it is necessary to pay attention to massive arms purchasing by georgia during several years now we see how these arms and georgian special troops who had been trained by foreign specialists are used
3270881 russia has already begun consultations with the ambassadors of the nato countries and consultations with nato military representatives will be held tomorrow
3270882 we will caution them against continuing to further support of saakashvili
3270883 it is an undisguised aggression accompanied by a mass propaganda war
3270884 start military action against abkhazia however the abkhaz fortified region turned out to be unassailable for georgian armed formations therefore a different tactic was chosen aimed against south ossetia which is more accessible territorially

3270946 welzalig zij die onberispelijk van wandel zijn die in de wet des heren gaan welzalig zij die zijn getuigenissen bewaren die hem van ganser harte zoeken die ook geen onrecht plegen maar wandelen in zijn wegen
3270947 maar laten we god danken die ons door jezus christus onze heer de overwinning geeft
3270948 en ik zag een andere engel vliegen in het midden des hemels en hij had een eeuwig evangelie om dat te verkondigen aan hen die op de aarde gezeten zijn en aan alle volk en stam en taal en natie en hij zeide met luider stem vreest god en geeft hem eer want de ure van zijn oordeel is gekomen en aanbidt hem die de hemel en de aarde en de zee en de waterbronnen gemaakt heeft
3270949 geliefden nu zijn wij kinderen gods en het is nog niet geopenbaard wat wij zijn zullen maar wij weten dat als hij zal geopenbaard zijn wij hem gelijk zullen wezen want wij zullen hem zien gelijk hij is
3270950 wie niet zijn kruis draagt en achter mij komt kan mijn discipel niet zijn
3270951 zo zal dus niemand van u die niet afstand doet van al wat hij heeft mijn discipel kunnen zijn
3270952 want de woorden die gij mij gegeven hebt heb ik hun gegeven en zij hebben ze aangenomen en in waarheid erkend dat ik van u ben uitgegaan en zij hebben geloofd dat gij mij gezonden hebt
3270953 uit mijzelf kan ik niets het is de vader die in mij werkt
3270954 ze zal een zoon baren geef hem de naam jezus want hij zal zijn volk bevrijden van hun zonden
3270955 zo moet het ook voor u vaststaan vaststaand feit dat gij wel dood zijt voor de zonde maar levend voor god in christus jezus laat dan de zonde niet langer als koning heersen in uw sterfelijk lichaam zodat gij aan zijn begeerten zoudt gehoorzamen en stelt uw leden niet langer als wapenen der ongerechtigheid ten dienste van de zonde maar stelt u ten dienste van god als mensen die dood zijn geweest maar thans leven en stelt uw leden als wapenen der gerechtigheid ten dienste van god immers de zonde zal over u geen heerschappij voeren want gij zijt niet onder de wet maar onder de genade
3270956 maar god zij gedankt die ons te allen tijde in christus doet zegevieren
3270957 hem nu die u voor struikelen kan behoeden en onberispelijk doen staan voor zijn heerlijkheid in grote vreugde de enige god onze heiland zij door jezus christus onze here heerlijkheid majesteit kracht en macht voor alle eeuwigheid en nu en in alle eeuwigheden amen
3270958 mijn geest zal ik in uw binnenste geven en maken dat gij naar mijn inzettingen wandelt en naarstig mijn verordeningen onderhoudt
3270959 to talk of many things of shoes and ships and sealing wax of cabbages and kings and why the sea is boiling hot and whether pigs have wings
3270960 ik zond telkens weer mijn dienaren de profeten naar jullie en liet hen zeggen staak deze gruwelijke praktijken ik verafschuw ze
3270961 er zijn zeven dingen waar ik een hartgrondige gruwel aan heb als je die dingen doet maakt het mij ziek ik walg ervan wanneer je jezelf beter acht dan een ander wanneer je niet de waarheid spreekt en hoogmoedige ogen hebt ik walg ervan wanneer je dingen doet die het leven van een ander beknot en kwetst en als je in je hart plannen smeedt die niemand goed doen ik walg ervan als je blijdschap vindt in het kwade en twist stookt onder je broeders en je zusters
3270962 ik stel geen schandelijke dingen voor mijn ogen ik haat het doen der afvalligen het kleeft mij niet aan
3270963 de vreze des heren is het kwade te haten hoogmoed en trots en boze wandel en een mond vol draaierijen haat ik
3270964 geliefde broeder volg niet het kwade na maar het goede wie goed doet komt uit god voort wie kwaad doet heeft god niet gezien
3270965 van mij te kopen ogenzalf om uw oogleden te bestrijken opdat gij zien moogt
3270966 anderen weder hebben hoon en geselslagen verduurd daarenboven nog boeien en gevangenschap zij zijn gestenigd op zware proef gesteld doormidden gezaagd met het zwaard vermoord zij hebben rondgezworven in schapenvachten en geitevellen onder ontbering verdrukking en mishandeling de wereld was hunner niet waardig zij hebben rondgedoold door woestijnen en gebergten in spelonken en de holen der aarde
3270967 ik zal over het huis van david en over de inwoners van jeruzalem uitgieten de geest der genade en der gebeden zij zullen hem aanschouwen die zij doorstoken hebben en over hem een rouwklacht aanheffen als de rouwklacht over een enig kind ja zij zullen over hem bitter leed dragen als het leed om een eerstgeborene
3270968 waarom heb ik het gedaan waarom heb ik het gedaan waarom heb ik het gedaan
3270969 ze hadden zich verstopt voor de duitsers toen de baby van de vrouw begon te wenen om haar leven en dat van de anderen te redden heeft ze haar baby de mond gesnoerd ze werden uiteindelijk toch ontdekt en toen zag de moeder dat ze het kind in haar angst gestikt had
3270970 te dien dage zal in jeruzalem de rouwklacht groot zijn zoals de rouwklacht van hadadrimmon in het dal van megiddo het land zal een rouwklacht aanheffen alle geslachten afzonderlijk het geslacht van het huis van david afzonderlijk en hun vrouwen afzonderlijk het geslacht van het huis van natan afzonderlijk en hun vrouwen afzonderlijk het geslacht van het huis van levi afzonderlijk en hun vrouwen afzonderlijk het geslacht van simi afzonderlijk en hun vrouwen afzonderlijk alle overige geslachten alle geslachten afzonderlijk en hun vrouwen afzonderlijk
3270971 te dien dage ten dage van het zien en het leed zal er een bron ontsloten zijn voor het huis van david en voor de inwoners van jeruzalem ter ontzondiging en reiniging
3270972 zij die wandelen in de schaduw van het kruis beseffen dat het hun zonde was die het hart van gods zoon brak
3270973 zij die denken aan het resultaat van de bespoediging of verhindering van het evangelie brengen dit meestal in verband met henzelf en de wereld
3270974 er zijn weinigen die daarbij aan de gevolgen denken voor god
3270975 in al hun benauwdheid was ook hij benauwd en hij hief hen op en droeg hen al de dagen van ouds
3270976 de hele schepping in al haar delen zucht en in barensnood is
3270977 het is ikzelf die daar behoorde te hangen maar hij nam mijn plaats in
3270978 wij kunnen niet lichtgeraakt zijn en ongeduldig en tezelfdertijd christen zijn want een lichtgeraakte en ongeduldige geest is niet de geest van christus ongeduld brengt de vijand van god en de mens in ons gezin en verjaagt gods engelen indien je in christus blijft en christus in jou kun je geen boze woorden spreken
3270979 geliefde broeder volg niet het kwade na maar het goede wie goed doet komt uit god voort wie kwaad doet heeft god niet gezien
3270980 door gemeenschap met god door gebed en de studie van zijn woord kunnen we zon gevoel van zijn heiligheid aankweken dat we de zonde zullen zien zoals hij ze ziet
3270981 want voorwaar ik zeg u indien gij een geloof hebt als een mosterdzaad zult gij tot deze berg zeggen verplaats u vanhier daarheen en hij zal zich verplaatsen en niets zal u onmogelijk zijn
3270982 want de here uw god is het die met u gaat om voor u te strijden tegen uw vijanden ten einde u de overwinning te geven
3270983 ga heen en zondigt niet meer zie maar hoe je het voor mekaar krijgt en veel geluk ermee
3270984 want wij hebben niet te worstelen tegen bloed en vlees maar tegen de overheden tegen de machten tegen de wereldbeheersers dezer duisternis tegen de boze geesten in de hemelse gewesten
3270985 onze god zult gij over hen niet gericht houden wij immers zijn niet opgewassen tegen deze grote menigte die tegen ons is opgerukt en wij weten niet wat wij doen moeten maar op u zijn onze ogen gevestigd
3270986 ik zelf zal voor u uitgaan en de oneffenheden effenen koperen deuren zal ik verbreken en ijzeren grendels verbrijzelen
3270987 maar in dit alles zijn wij meer dan overwinnaars door hem die ons heeft liefgehad
3270988 toon mij iemand die deze ervaring heeft want ik ken zo iemand niet
3270989 volstrekt niet maar het blijve god waarachtig en ieder mens leugenachtig
3270990 god bedoelt niet wat hij zegt god is niet almachtig
3270991 stelt uzelf op de proef of gij wel in het geloof zijt onderzoekt uzelf of zijt gij niet zo zeker van uzelf dat jezus christus in u is want anders zijt gij verwerpelijk
3270992 als gij in mijn woord blijft zijt gij waarlijk discipelen van mij en gij zult de waarheid verstaan en de waarheid zal u vrijmaken
3270993 wie overwint hem zal ik geven met mij te zitten op mijn troon gelijk ook ik heb overwonnen en gezeten ben met mijn vader op zijn troon
3270994 ik heb u geschreven vaders want gij kent hem die van den beginne is ik heb u geschreven jongelingen want gij zijt sterk en het woord gods blijft in u en gij hebt de boze overwonnen
3270995 gaat niet voort met huichelachtige offers te brengen gruwelijk reukwerk is het mij nieuwe maan en sabbat het bijeenroepen der samenkomsten
3270996 houd op met godsdienstig te zijn als je mij niet dient
3270997 hoewel het lijkt dat hij zielen wint voor de waarheid is de ongeheiligde arbeider een valse en gevaarlijke gids
3270998 maar wij doen onszelf in alles kennen we willen laten zien nbv als dienaren gods in veel dulden in verdrukkingen in noden in benauwdheden in slagen in gevangenschappen in oproeren in moeiten in nachten zonder slaap in dagen zonder eten in reinheid in kennis in lankmoedigheid in rechtschapenheid in de heilige geest in ongeveinsde liefde
3270999 want het loon dat de zonde geeft is de dood
3271000 wie zijn overtredingen bedekt zal niet voorspoedig zijn maar wie ze belijdt en nalaat die vindt ontferming
3271001 de ziel die zondigt die zal sterven een zoon zal niet mede de ongerechtigheid van de vader dragen en een vader zal niet mede de ongerechtigheid van de zoon dragen de gerechtigheid van de rechtvaardige zal alleen rusten op hemzelf en de goddeloosheid van de goddeloze zal alleen rusten op hemzelf
3271002 door zijn schuld heb ik een zondige natuur en daardoor zondig ik
3271003 vader vergeef hen want ze weten niet wat ze doen
3271004 verdraagt elkander en vergeeft elkander indien de een tegen de ander een grief heeft gelijk ook de here u vergeven heeft doet ook gij evenzo
3271005 zij die overwinnen zullen met mij zitten op de troon
3271006 zie de hand des heren is niet te kort om te verlossen en zijn oor niet te onmachtig om te horen maar uw ongerechtigheden zijn het die scheiding brengen tussen u en uw god en uw zonden doen zijn aangezicht voor u verborgen zijn zodat hij niet hoort
3271007 belijden we onze zonden dan zal hij die trouw en rechtvaardig is ons onze zonden vergeven en ons reinigen van alle kwaad

3271042 a leader with a commanding personality may secure the public action of many when the issue is made one of religious merit through some public act under such an impression a serious person may stand in a meeting who has no conception of what is involved in standing by faith on the rock christ jesus or he may be persuaded to abandon his natural timidity when he knows nothing of abandoning his satanic tendency to self help and resting by faith on that which christ has done for him if questioned carefully the basis of assurance with all such converts will be found to be no more than a consciousness that they have acted out the program prescribed for them

3271104 we didnt have the geographic plant to equal client care
3271105 so we have tried to create an environment to ease some of that anxiety through timely care and care which has to be good

3271112 all that obsessive dwelling you do with all that time
3271113 you can have a plan of action that much sooner

3271122 john just isnt the same as he used to be hes not his own man
3271123 a lot of that has to do with how hes wanted this job so bad for so long that hes tied himself to president bush

3271126 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species

3271164 if a woman had 10 years that she stayed at home with her family a traditional assessment would have been that she did nothing in those years
3271165 my assessment was different because i know when i was home with my kids i was active in the schools and community organizations and of course you learn a great deal from bringing up children
3271166 hence the situation that he has been detained does not exist
3271167 seven to eight plainclothes officers who beat me and dragged me and my brother hua huilin into two separate cars
3271168 they asked me why i was going to kuanjie protestant church to worship and threatened me saying you are not allowed to go
3271169 after about four or five hours when i saw that the people who were watching me had all fallen asleep i fled but im afraid to go home
3271170 i havent heard from him weve been waiting here were so worried
3271171 my father asks me every day where he is and i tell him i dont know

3271173 this is a little awkward but im wondering if you received the gift card i slipped into your mail slot i never heard from you so i just want to make sure you received it
3271174 im sitting there with my legs crossed covering my groin and going yeow i wouldnt want that to happen to any writer
3271175 harry a history the true story of a boy wizard his fans and life inside the harry potter phenomenon
3271176 as positive as a fan can be about a series they love it can easily go the other way
3271177 you have time to think about it and get fixated about it
3271178 this is a very intense and passionate audience that shes writing for
3271179 and the material is so emotional and so fraught bella and edward come so close so many times and force themselves away so often you build up an unbearable amount of tension people were almost quivering like bow strings that have been plucked
3271180 they are unique in that they are of a rural agrarian south and they speak to a time gone by
3271181 he draws all day long except for the time that he spends in activity and eating his meals

3271183 a schoolteacher put me to drawing a long time ago drawing pictures
3271184 you know what i see is his ability the beauty that he actually puts on paper that comes out of him and his mind
3271185 theres a presence with him im telling you that feels angelic
3271186 also theres a rhythm maybe dictated by the long sheets of paper that he works on that makes it seem like hes just going on and on recording the memories of his life
3271187 produced by self taught individuals usually without formal training whose works arise from an innate personal vision that revels foremost in the creative act itself
3271188 another bold move that exemplifies her powerful position in todays society
3271189 but what we are picking up on is a sense that maybe there is an overinflation of the lips theres an overabundance of fillers in her face
3271190 it has nothing to do with being gender confused or gay as the bulk of wearers are straight men in long term relationships
3271191 with energy prices going up and up i think were going to see even more men around the world wearing these products
3271192 we just believe releasing it on a wednesday before a four day weekend is like having a rolling sneak preview
3271193 you get a lot of positive word of mouth going into the weekend you have two days of people validating the movie locally
3271194 its a sign that people are not only picking movies as the weekend choice for entertainment but also in the middle of the week as well
3271195 no one would ever release a movie on a wednesday if they didnt have a movie that really played
3271196 you dont want to risk the weekend if you have a movie that doesnt
3271197 the hardest genre to market is the r rated comedy
3271198 because you cant show the movies funniest moments on television
3271199 wednesday is not a dead day at any time of the year frankly because of what it can do for your film
3271200 you get a lot more money on the wednesday and thursday of that first week than what you would get on the following wednesday and thursday and i would rather get as much of my money upfront then let the movie play out week after week
3271201 bhp and rio have both been quite strong its mostly that move in bhp and rio thats pushed the market into positive territory today

3271203 he will need to have access to this in order for us to proceed with this matter ms morgan said

3271206 i never knew he would have booked me in under any other name i didnt notice it until they started calling me alia ahmed
3271207 i kept telling myself that after they took my fingerprints they would find out right away but they didnt
3271208 i thought they had the perfect system but sometimes things go wrong
3271209 you cant bring pikes back but this can hold those responsible accountable for their actions
3271210 if theres any culpability here its on winnfield for not properly training police officers
3271211 we in russia we cannot see how we can do business with him
3271212 the immediate and unconditional cessation of hostilities and the complete withdrawal of russian and georgian forces to their positions prior to august 7
3271213 to take further action as appropriate to help bring about and implement a peaceful and durable solution to the crisis
3271214 we have not received a clear answer today to that question
3271215 why start a second front from abkhazia why attack the rest of georgia and why attack the infrastructure of georgia why threaten to attack the civilian airport of tbilisi
3271216 his ability to capture the moment was second to none
3271217 win or lose we had a great time every day
3271218 remarkable talent and a unique wit who had an unbridled joy for the atlanta braves
3271219 his impact on the braves can be characterized so simply braves win braves win braves win
3271220 you know you go through times where you feel it might not happen but you never ever give up hope
3271221 you dont ever use the word never happen its not healthy
3271222 to be in prison for 18 years for something you didnt do and then know you are going to walk out of court a free man thats a lot to take in in one day
3271223 i believe that there are others in prison like me and then there are others in prison who are guilty youve got to give it a chance to work
3271224 he was a fierce competitor but he always found humor in situations
3271225 he was a sports nut but he loved writing about it as much as playing sports it was his passion
3271226 theyd been out there in the field for three days and they were coming back in for a shower and a good meal
3271227 we dont believe we are in a position to wait much longer for resolution of this question

3271229 rather than focus on building consensus for a budget that addresses californias long term fiscal problems the governor seems adamant on picking a fight over whether state employees are entitled to the wages they have worked for and earned

3271242 theres certain guys who can play first grade at a young age and theres certain ones youve got to leave a little bit longer but i thought confidence wise he doesnt lack anything there
3271243 in all honesty hes not really ready for first grade

3271261 even though the jury acquitted me of these charges in less than three hours my political opponents and some of the news media would likely spend the next several months vilifying me further

3271272 the key negatives are likely to be cbas relative equity market and general insurance leverage relatively high expense growth and perceptions of relative under provisioning

3271274 i think you have got to put a lot of that down to the preoccupation with security
3271275 but security youre in the hands of the host organisers
3271276 and they havent been able to manage the balance between security and creating that atmosphere i suppose

3271406 everyone was writing us off because of everything that weve been though
3271407 but we never for one moment doubted ourselves now our goal is to go out and get a medal in all around or individuals
3271408 id been watching those guys nail their routines and it really gave me confidence going into my one event
3271409 i just got up there and knew i was going to do a good
3271410 its a little harder when youre competing for yourself here we are nine guys all with the same goal in mind and you cant help but be more confident thats the great thing about a team
3271411 im confident our team started to get a little more confident after several rotations and started having more fun it was a great time
3271412 were not even realizing what an incredible athlete he is
3271413 obviously hes amazing and he breaks all these world records but i think being a part of that we almost take it for granted
3271414 i want to do things that no one else in the sport has ever done
3271415 it will remain to be seen where history ultimately places him but clearly today he is the best swimmer weve seen
3271416 he was very active and never stopped moving and it was kind of hard to harness that at first
3271417 its a little bit counterintuitive because even though he was so rambunctious as a young swimmer when he raced he was very focused
3271418 i always had dreams of being an olympian being a world record holder being a professional athlete being a gold medallist and i had to focus on those goals to achieve them and i knew that
3271419 i think he missed out on a normal progression of things but i wouldnt say hes missed anything
3271420 i would say he would tell you what hes gained has been a lot better than what hes missed
3271421 i would never trade going to the olympic games and standing on top of the medal podium or being able to turn professional or travel all over the world i would never trade any of it in
3271422 there are a lot of things that people havent done and i want to change the sport and be the first person to do new things
3271423 ive lost one of my best buddies and it is not easy to reckon with
3271424 i know one can never put a question mark where god puts a period so i will not question the almightys decision to call him home we all know when that call comes we all will answer personally my buddy will be missed for many reasons by me he was family
3271425 he will be a part of my musical life each time i sing the song d j vu as this was a birthday gift to me from him
3271426 my family and i send sincere heartfelt condolences to his family for their enormous loss and we will hold them in continuous prayer
3271427 its a nice break for the legs the stress of going after balls in the outfield cutting balls off in the gap its nice to get a break from that
3271428 i think i might burn out on it a little bit
3271429 it definitely is a welcome break i could see myself doing it for a week or two at a time who knows you never know how it works out but ive prided myself on my defense for so long it would be weird not to play very often
3271430 danks had been good all night keeping the ball off the outside corner really painting
3271431 he threw me a really good pitch the first pitch of the at bat i just tried to stay on it and drive the ball and it worked out going to the gap
3271432 my heart is fixed o god my heart is fixed
3271433 he who pleads with god for the remission of sin also pleads with his own heart to detest it
3271434 i want you to reveal my sin i want you to stir it up in me i want you to show it to me i want you to blow away the dust that is covering it i want you to peel off the things that have been hiding it away in my life so that it becomes manifest and visible to me i want to see the reality of my sin i want you to show it to me just the way it is
3271435 god show me all the sins of my life reveal all of them uncover every little corner of my life bring it up and may it become as detestable to me as it is to you may i never do that again and may you give me the strength to see it go away
3271436 i was running a fever of 104 degrees and it was hard to breathe i was weak and i couldnt sweat it off
3271437 its hard because a lot of people dont understand what im going through these days nobody has heard of sarcoidosis nobody knows anything about it
3271438 i was like oh my goodness could that happen to me
3271439 the medications you take suppress your immune system and then you get staph infections fungal infections and bacterial infections

3271441 i couldnt talk id be coughing so hard and itd go on for 15 or 20 minutes they kept giving me stuff and none of it would help
3271442 im sorry to see him gone but hes bringing a lot of awareness of sarcoidosis to the forefront and thats a good thing

3271480 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3271481 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3271482 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3271483 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3271484 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3271485 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3271486 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3271557 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3271558 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3271559 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3271560 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3271561 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3271562 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from tax and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3271563 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3271564 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff
3271565 following recent media reports of significant civilian casualties isaf has now concluded a thorough investigation of the claim and has evidence that those killed were insurgents

3271587 moscow has repeatedly demanded that jerusalem halt its military assistance to georgia finally threatening a crisis in bilateral relations
3271588 jerusalem has a strong interest in having caspian oil and gas pipelines reach the turkish terminal port of ceyhan rather than the russian network intense negotiations are afoot between israel turkey georgia turkmenistan and azarbaijan for pipelines to reach turkey and thence to israels oil terminal at ashkelon and on to its red sea port of eilat from there supertankers can carry the gas and oil to the far east through the indian ocean

3271606 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on
3271607 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3271608 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3271609 the operation to liberate kodori gorge has started everything is developing according to plan
3271610 georgian people will never surrender freedom and democracy because democracy is stronger than any of their tanks any of their bombings any of their brutal equipment
3271611 the cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several us diplomats it is a real shame
3271612 we received very reliable information that the russians decided to move towards gori thats why we decided to pull out all our troops and to relocate them to defend tbilisi
3271613 russian peacekeepers and support units are carrying out an operation aimed at preventing georgian forces from regrouping to carry new attacks on south ossetia senaki is one of the places where such actions were underway
3271614 there is no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe

3271640 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation

3271656 we dont tolerate anti social behaviour and the community shouldnt have to put up with it either
3271657 whats the point of having nkes if you cant use them
3271658 the reason lado did this is because he knew the enormous pr value that georgia would gain by going to the money people and analysts particularly since georgia is clearly the aggressor this time
3271659 lado is a former banker himself so he knew that by framing the conflict for the most influential bankers and analysts in new york that these power bankers would then write up reports and go on cnbc and argue lado gurgenidzes talking points it was brilliant and now youre starting to see the american media shift its coverage from calling it georgia invading ossetian territory to the new spin that its russian imperial aggression against tiny little georgia

3271702 hampir seluruh bangunan fisik milik masyarakat di sumbar seperti masjid kantor wali nagari sekolah musala dan surau dibangun dengan biaya utama atas sumbangan perantau salah satunya dari acara pulang basamo
3271703 demikian juga dua masjid beberapa surau dan dua bangunan sekolah di sini namun banyak masyarakat kesulitan untuk membiayai pendidikan anak mereka kita sebenarnya berharap pembangunan mental seperti pendidikan juga hal yang amat penting untuk diperhatikan
3271704 jika ada yang membantu untuk pendidikan keluarga tak mampu atau beasiswa biasanya dalam bentuk zakat atau infak
3271705 jumlahnya paling sedikit dua kali lipat dari total penduduk sumbar yang berjumlah 4 5 juta jiwa mereka potensi besar untuk mengatasi masalah kemiskinan di sumbar

3271712 padahal hal ini akan berdampak buruk apabila rekam medis gigi diperlukan sebagai pembanding data jika terjadi suatu musibah
3271713 sayangnya dari jumlah tersebut tidak ada satupun orang indonesia yang berhasil diidentifikasi dari giginya

3271732 information is the most important factor of our life thus the attempts to deprive millions of orthodox ukrainian citizens of their right on information are the direct persecutions of orthodoxy

3271797 to be tied for the most olympic gold medals is pretty amazing
3271798 i mean the olympics have been around for a long time its definitely an honor i spent some time with carl lewis and exchanged some words here and there with spitz so thats pretty amazing
3271799 but you know what its pretty cool to say that i was in that race its not every day you say you get to swim in an olympics final and then to add that you swam against michael phelps
3271800 when i watch him i see a lot of natural talent obviously
3271801 but he also has amazing focus watching him warm up he has such amazing attention to detail he knows exactly what hes going to do and how hes going to do it and he knows that before every race
3271802 and when he gets challenged he knows how to deviate from that plan it seems like he can always find something else in his tank and get home faster than everyone else
3271803 its just a honor just to be swimming with that guy to be a part of his history
3271804 hes doing some unbelievable things out there making even the best swimmers in the world look at him in awe
3271805 to swim in a race where he went that fast just to be a part of that is really amazing i mean ive never seen an athlete like him before
3271806 you have to improve on areas of your race that are his strength like turns
3271807 i mean maybe your swim can be as fast as his but if he gets a body length on you in the turns its not going to matter
3271808 i know a lot of people are trying hard to find ways to beat him but it doesnt look like its working
3271809 if we feel the rule has been breached we will invoke it
3271810 but we have a club owner who has not yet been found guilty of any offence
3271811 we will not turn a blind eye to issues of a serious nature but it is quite a complex matter and we cant just make a judgement on the spot
3271812 one of the things the industry has long called for is to move on from a one size fits all mentality to one that reflects regional need customers will be hoping the regulator will reflect this regional diversity in the final determinations in 2009
3271813 our view is that realistic investment in renewing assets cant be put off indefinitely at least it cant without risking a fall off in service that customers would hate and could seriously damage the economy and the environment
3271814 some of this increase is also aimed for the first time at dealing with climate change related issues from improving the flood resilience of critical infrastructure to widespread plans to increase household metering
3271815 ofwat have a very difficult task in balancing the requirement for significant investment with customers priorities not to see bills increase more than is necessary
3271816 water and sewerage prices between 2010 and 2015 need to be set in line with what customers are willing and able to pay and companies should deliver a package of benefits in line with what consumers see as a priority
3271817 the consumer council for water has encouraged water companies to give extra back to consumers and this has resulted in 130m of benefits in two years we will take the same approach in pressing ofwat and the companies to be guided by the needs of consumers up to 2015

3271820 it is a brave decision and rikki deserves respect for putting the team ahead of his own ambitions as a captain
3271821 i know my team for the andorra and croatia games but for the next one some very important players are not fit right now
3271822 we have to wait for a decision but against the czechs the first xi will be the best for me at that particular time
3271823 gerrard and rooney are very important players and i dont know whether they will be fit for this game
3271824 but i hope they will be fit for andorra and croatia and well be able to play them in the squad
3271825 i saw croatia in the euros and they played well enough with spirit and pride in their country and have good quality in midfield and up front
3271826 but i have a lot of confidence in my team because in the games i saw only spain played really well and so the best team won the tournament because they played with confidence

3271834 absolutely ron george should be thrown out for voting for gay marriage
3271835 he has a very radical view of whats a family
3271836 i really felt that as chief justice i had to have the broad shoulders because i knew there would be substantial controversy about it
3271837 most people thought his legacy would be the modernization of the courts
3271838 i think the gay marriage decision will now be his principal legacy
3271839 it isnt anything that i have given any thought to i will do what i should do when that time comes about
3271840 theres evidence that the bus may have suffered tire tread separation
3271841 the drivers side front tire looked like it went through a meat grinder
3271842 the wheel and the remnants of the tire are still intact on the bus so it looks like something deteriorated in the tire
3271843 you cant bring pikes back but this can hold those responsible accountable for their actions
3271844 if theres any culpability here its on winnfield for not properly training police officers
3271845 knowingly tolerated and turned a blind eye to an unjustifiable risk and frequency of such mistaken identity arrests
3271846 i never knew he would have booked me in under any other name i didnt notice it until they started calling me alia ahmed
3271847 i kept telling myself that after they took my fingerprints they would find out right away but they didnt
3271848 i thought they had the perfect system but sometimes things go wrong
3271849 the most important thing is the fact that in 36 of the states women are doing better than they were in 1997 and by better i mean as a comparison of the percentage of women in leadership posts compared with the percentage of women in the state
3271850 if a woman had 10 years that she stayed at home with her family a traditional assessment would have been that she did nothing in those years
3271851 my assessment was different because i know when i was home with my kids i was active in the schools and community organizations and of course you learn a great deal from bringing up children
3271852 our forces on the ground are withdrawing from the conflict areas so we expect fighting to end by tomorrow wednesday
3271853 were making sure the areas are safe before we could allow residents to move back to their homes and farms we have cleared a total of seven villages and we hope to re establish control in the remaining eight villages by tomorrow
3271854 our problem now is we cant get in because of the security aspect we are being prevented from going in by the international committee of the red cross because of the unstable situation
3271855 but we are preparing for a big rush of food and medicine and all things that they need
3271856 he was a fierce competitor but he always found humor in situations
3271857 he was a sports nut but he loved writing about it as much as playing sports it was his passion
3271858 theyd been out there in the field for three days and they were coming back in for a shower and a good meal
3271859 his ability to capture the moment was second to none
3271860 win or lose we had a great time every day
3271861 remarkable talent and a unique wit who had an unbridled joy for the atlanta braves
3271862 his impact on the braves can be characterized so simply braves win braves win braves win
3271863 we were coming off a couple of heartbreakers ourselves so i think guys were a little determined to finish this one
3271864 sometimes it puts pressure on me sometimes you get wins with your eyes closed and sometimes there are games like this
3271865 hes growing up out there and maturing and the results are starting to come
3271866 moyer put on a good show do you think he could run out of daylight in an eight day week
3271867 japan performed some beautiful gymnastics china also performed beautiful gymnastics but they also have the power
3271868 if we had more power we could have done much better
3271869 it never gets old it really does feel like the first time its an absolutely beautiful feeling
3271870 i dont know if its shoulder strength or what but the amount of water hes able to hold is unbelievable and obviously hes got the right mind for it
3271871 hes always up to race and he always performs when it matters i think altogether that makes him a great performer better than the rest of the world obviously
3271872 it doesnt get any easier to be honest but certainly the experience and the knowledge that youve done it before helps knowing hopefully that you can probably do it again i really wanted to race today
3271873 i train to pretty much win on my worst day and thats the kind of mentality i use honestly i dont know what goes on in these others guys heads i know what i have to do to get my hand on the wall and to do what i have to do
3271874 i still have love for her its something i have to work on
3271875 they want to establish in the mind of a potential jury pool that there is more to taveys story than meets the eye
3271876 anybody who wants to beat me up for this they should have at it
3271877 the truth is you cant possibly beat me up more than ive already beaten myself up
3271878 i was taken in by his magnificent rhetoric and now i think hes treacherous
3271879 its an insult greater than i could ever imagine that he would do this to that magnificent family he has
3271880 he was trying to relieve himself of the horror of what he had done almost saying had i known that she was in the last stages of her life i would never have done it
3271881 what that demonstrates is that he had no love for his wife because you dont do that to someone you love he has soiled her
3271882 i dont think that candidates private lives are particularly relevant to how theyll perform in office
3271883 if we rated our presidents by the quality of their private lives youd have to say that nixon and bush are two of the best presidents we ever had
3271884 john edwards knows what the rules are he knew at the time he ran for president that he was having an affair and he should have known that was going to come out it was reckless for him to run for president under those terms i feel very disappointed in him his campaign the judgment he showed
3271885 it would have been better if hed issued an apology and just gone away
3271886 tarnishes the moral credibility hes built through his work on poverty and it also raises questions about his overall judgment
3271887 most prolific offerors of apparent child pornography in the comcast norths internet provider gallagher was able to use an internet protocol address assigned to north to find his home agents who preliminarily reviewed the hard drive found in norths home thursday believe some of the images both still and motion depicted a pre pubescent girl engaged in sexually explicit activities in north wasnt home during the search but gallagher went to his office in ibm providing information technology services to the department of homeland security
3271888 sure after i trained him to be the perfect boyfriend he breaks up with me and goes to be perfect for someone else
3271889 could we not decide right now could we table this and at least talk about it later
3271890 if this is what it means to trust the divine then im done
3271891 how could i have possibly attracted this to my life this stuff cant be true
3271892 just remember you control your own thoughts no one else so you make the decision on what youre going to dwell on
3271893 you can be as happy as you want to be or as miserable as you want to be the choice is yours
3271894 the emotion we felt after edgbaston was always going to be difficult to re invent
3271895 the task force appears to be fully satisfied with the security arrangements being carried out for the champions trophy
3271896 my husband and i have been married for three years and we have a good relationship he is a very low key guy and i love that about him i on the other hand am like the energizer bunny on speed i just started medical school i volunteer at an aids clinic and i am waitressing to help pay the bills my issue is this my husband wont help me with some things that i need to get done but dont have time to do myself i dont know what it is because we really get along with each other but he really resists me over this one thing for example i have to get my passport sent certified mail and he would have to actually go into the post office to take care of it for me he doesnt get that i dont have time or energy to do this i dont think that is too much to ask what do i do
3271897 i do want to be with my body mind soulmate i dont remember being abandoned by girlfriends while i was dating someone nor when i broke up with him i found my girlfirends most supportive this was true for boyfriends and when i divorced
3271898 oh i wish i was married or at least truly serious about someone
3271899 hey darlin want to drive down to the beach and take a walk
3271900 it is a beautiful afternoon and it will be cooler down there
3271901 too much traffic and it will be a problem finding parking
3271902 i dont like the beach in the summer it is too crowded i prefer to go down there in the winter
3271903 i like winter too but it was fun watching all the different people enjoying the day
3271904 we are tasked with producing a list of five categories namely groups 1 2 and 3 listed and prestige jumping races of the best races in new zealand for horses of different ages sex and aptitudes this is a very detailed and lengthy process and i commend the committee for the time effort and expertise they have brought to it
3271905 in assessing the quality of horses competing in every one of these races we look first and foremost for consistency of quality over time we must also place some emphasis on the timing and place of each race within the pattern of racing the prize money offered and their quality within the international context this is absolutely essential to maintain the international credibility of new zealand bloodstock
3271906 its like the economic tide went out and now we get to see who went swimming without any trunks on

3271919 he has a tendency to want to get out of there
3271920 i have to show them that i know what im doing out there and show them i can be a leader and run this team thats what theyre looking for someone who knows the playbook inside and out and can show the other guys to help them and have them trust you
3271921 i feel like im in a decent spot right now its just a matter of staying consistent getting first team reps is a big confidence booster and when you succeed in there and make some plays that also helps
3271922 i think i need to show them that i can run the offense consistently and make plays what they are looking for is a leader someone to take charge
3271923 im just trying to stay in the thick of it and work on my stuff and not worry so much about competing with corp its more just getting everything down its not going to be much of a competition if i dont know what im doing

3271928 it is unlikely that aggression against our nato allies will occur with aircraft and tanks and troops
3271929 a nation could achieve the same and worse effects simply by turning off the taps people freeze industry stops
3271930 paying more attention and letting these countries know we are paying attention is our main objective
3271931 people think its too flattering to me that alexei miller was kind of stalking me when i was in the region
3271932 given the characteristics of russian diplomacy which have been not only competitive but sometimes gripping people by the throat they are likely to feel irritated that someone else is in the field
3271933 the united states does not have a clear consistent strategy to promote our long term security interests or our near term energy and economic interests the russians do
3271934 no no me creo que a las mujeres les guste s lo hacer y no que les hagan
3271935 qu suerte has tenido de que un t o tan bueno como yo te haya zumbao durante 10 segundos la siguiente
3271936 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3271937 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3271938 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3271939 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3271940 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3271941 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from tax and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3271942 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3271943 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff
3271944 theres a line between being responsible for rebuilding a country you helped destroy and being a chump and i think we crossed that line
3271945 senator coleman at any time could have done these hearings on reconstruction and he did none
3271946 you know you have to watch that kind of thing
3271947 all of the men in my age group are married or satisfied with being single
3271948 what if i never meet the love of my life
3271949 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3271950 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3271951 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3271952 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3271953 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3271954 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3271955 im still trying to find someone but i dont think it will get any better in the foreseeable future
3271956 the process is very time consuming and i am already very busy as it is
3271957 this is the unfortunate reality of our health care system its an example of how the market triumphs over public policy
3271958 even if universal health care comes into play tomorrow not everyone would have access to a health care provider
3271959 for the future we need to retain at least 50 percent of residents trained inside of maryland and also make it more attractive for those who want to come from outside the state
3271960 i dont want to be strapped down with loans forever and i know that primary care pays on the lower end of the spectrum
3271961 the largest insurance companies in the state have not raised their reimbursement rates
3271962 ongoing expenses such as vaccines cost me more than what the insurance companies pay me
3271963 i love what i do and i get to take care of people on an extended basis
3271964 i develop a relationship with patients some through three four generations
3271965 i knew that dr bennett was going to have trouble finding another partner
3271966 i know at least three four family practices that cant find anyone and theyve been looking longer than him
3271967 theres a variety of tactics that employers have been employing over the last three to six years that has had an impact on the market
3271968 pretty much every employer has to do something or is doing something in an effort to bring that number down
3271969 it is encouraging that the growth in health care costs is going down but there is still more work to be done
3271970 when costs go up as great as this theres a lot of market pressure brought to bear on all of the parts of the market to bring those costs down and i think thats whats been happening over the last six years or so
3271971 oh i hooked up with him a couple of months ago and how do you know him
3271972 well my ex boyfriend used to do him a year ago and im planning on doing him in a couple of weeks my best friend is doing him now

3271977 generally revpar growth slowed through the second quarter and market conditions have become more challenging particularly in the u s
3271978 however the long term trends for the travel industry remain positive and our broad portfolio of brands and fee based business model positions us well to take full advantage of this
3271979 hip hop on the internet is really based on beef and a bad history
3271980 i dont really have that i dont have beef with any other rapper
3271981 i said i know a way that i could get the bloggers and the sites to start talking so i took my shirt off
3271982 i took my shirt off to give people something to laugh about to give people something to cry about but it made people talk about me
3271983 absolutely id be a liar if i wasnt saying that i was inspired when i seen rick ross doing it
3271984 i thought it was dope and i thought it was fun and i said you know what i can show off my belly too because as unsexy as it is to certain people theres a lot of girls out there thats chubbychasers
3271985 i just said why dont i just go all out and just get a pack of newports of course i put my twist on it and i called it the noreports people get a kick out of when they find out that it do open up and it do hold cigarettes
3271986 when you watch cnn in new york city its actually channel 10
3271987 i dont want to say its better than the war report or even the reunion but i do want to say is that its on another level its definitely bound to be another classic
3271988 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time
3271989 the sea ice causes problems for us in terms of observing the ocean in that it makes ship observation very expensive and slow
3271990 satellites cant see the ocean through the ice and the profiling floats we are using throughout the worlds oceans now are also unable to surface through the ice and transmit their data by satellite
3271991 the sea ice is important for climate because it is bright and reflects the suns energy back into space so if we have less sea ice the earth tends to absorb more energy and so warm up
3271992 weve never been able to measure how much sea ice is actually forming before and the seal data is allowing us to do that for the first time
3271993 we will be instrumenting a total of about 160 seals both in the arctic and antarctic using several different species of seal because different seals go to different places to feed so we can get information from different parts of the ocean
3271994 it could provide power for 300 000 homes each power station and our vision is that australias a suitable place for this and we could build up to 34 of these power stations by 2020
3271995 the ideal location for a thermal solar power station is a desert type location you want maximum solar with the least cloud cover or interference and our dry desert locations are ideal

3272002 my serious greco career has been with these new rules the whole time this is all i know
3272003 either i can be unhappy or be like those are the rules im going to go win under these rules
3272004 at first i was a little hesitant it was a little hard to grasp but i got used to it
3272005 being a classic wrestler i have to go with the old rules
3272006 it was a clash of warriors you brought in conditioning strength technique mental control to be able to outlast your opponent
3272007 im not sure if the guy thats the better man always wins under those rules
3272008 i think a guy that scores six points in a period and then loses 1 0 1 0 is better than the other guy if im the inferior guy id much rather take my chances on a 50 50 ball pull as opposed to a two minute period
3272009 i could have gone to one ncaa tournament 20 years ago show up today and know how a man wins a match
3272010 there is a high rate of drug and alcohol abuse in the industry stds mental health problems and pregnancies the industry is such that oftentimes people get burned through and come out with nothing no job skills or education so they need job training or state services
3272011 were telling lies about the industry that people were committing suicide and that drugs were rampant on the set
3272012 ich begann damit pers nlich von twitter als kommunikationsmedium abh ngig zu werden
3272013 wenn eine firma ein kommunikationsmedium ganz f r sich allein kontrolliert wird das schnell schwierig das l sst sich im web schwerlich auf dauer aufrechterhalten

3272015 he lost but he lost with honor i like brave wrestlers he took the challenge
3272016 i was sitting and watching hoping hed beat the russian but he didnt
3272017 hes pretty tough but i was there with him in the first period
3272018 i would have liked a few more seconds to tighten it up
3272019 but he was standing up and it was starting to slip off so i figured id better go before it got any looser when i initially went with it i thought it was going to be able to get it but i couldnt
3272020 im a little down but its just some small mistakes i made
3272021 im going to get back into the practice room work on them and be ready the next time
3272022 the position was 50 50 it could have gone either way he didnt have the real tight lock but it was time to go and thats what i liked about him hes not afraid to try
3272023 he has a lack of experience internationally its the first time hes wrestled this caliber of athletes

3272035 ich habe mich immer schon gefragt warum bei kinderkleidung der anspruch an stil und design geringer ist als bei erwachsenen
3272036 bevor wir gesch ftsleute sind sind wir doch vor allem eltern deshalb wissen wir ganz genau wie wichtig gl cklichsein unbeschwertheit und die richtige erziehung f r ein kind sind
3272037 nach meiner berzeugung k nnen wir nur dort mit allen sinnen genie en wo wir uns wohl f hlen

3272041 boris sagt ja er kann richtig scharf essen dann will ich doch mal sehen wie scharf er es wirklich aush lt
3272042 so habe ich mir das vorgestellt vorne das gesunde und hinten das dosenbier
3272043 genau boris tim schmeckts nicht mehr ich habe gearbeitet wie eine hafennutte 16 bis 18 stunden am tag und habe dabei meine pers nlichkeit ein bisschen vergessen
3272044 wenn sich boris richtig bl d anstellt dann geht er hungrig nach hause ich werde ihm nicht den gefallen tun mich hinzustellen und ihm sein mal zu kredenzen w hrend er sich die sonne auf den pelz scheinen l sst

3272048 hier ist ein interessanter artikel ein wichtiges argument und ich stimme dem zu oder eben nicht und zwar aus folgenden gr nden
3272049 wir haben nichts zu verlieren wir k nnen den zustand nur verbessern und das ist wirklich seine allerletzte chance
3272050 f r mich ist es das gleiche als l ge jemand aus der familie auf dem op tisch

3272054 it would be handy to have a little cheat sheet that clearly stated refer these cases with this info
3272055 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3272056 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself
3272057 wont a single tape of wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender
3272058 i feel like nancy pelosi as the democratic leader has failed our country miserably funding for more war
3272059 the speakers failed to hold george bush and dick cheney accountable
3272060 the speaker has the highest respect for cindy sheehan ms sheehan lost her son in the iraq war and has the right as every american has to run for office
3272061 they woke up this weekend and figured out that that ad resonated and they needed to do something about it
3272062 if the celebrity issue were not hurting them they would have ignored it
3272063 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3272064 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3272065 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3272066 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3272067 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3272068 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from tax and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3272069 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3272070 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff
3272071 letter to a new president commonsense lessons for our next leader
3272072 son of privilege and dynasty who had defined himself as the president of only that fraction of the country which shared his world view
3272073 sen byrd doesnt believe sen mccain is going to be the next president
3272074 but if sen mccain is interested in receiving a copy of the book wed be happy to get him a copy
3272075 a big lie is still a lie tell the truth
3272076 let the press do its job even when that might sting
3272077 i would submit that a president who is unable to learn from his or her own mistakes and then to articulate for a curious public what he or she has learned is not prepared for that office
3272078 banished himself to the ignominious position of worst united states president ever
3272079 built much of its program around a basic commitment to lying
3272080 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3272081 when one country conquers another that is typically regarded as pretty serious and the inability to do anything about it is something the united states is not accustomed to
3272082 the path of freedom you have chosen is not easy but you will not travel it alone
3272083 we have no doubts about it this is a deliberate attempt to destroy an entire country and change the regime
3272084 the united states is a reliable partner in the world
3272085 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3272086 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3272087 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3272088 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3272089 over the years the endangered species act has become a regulatory nightmare that kills or stalls even the most well crafted land use projects
3272090 the economy suffers people suffer rational environmental planning suffers some careful streamlining is long overdue
3272091 sterreich die richtige balance zwischen einer politik die den anteil der erneuerbaren energien erh ht und einer die eine effiziente energienutzung f rdert noch nicht gefunden

3272094 it seems the eyes could be a window to look at the condition of small vessels throughout the body including the heart said lead researcher dr jie jin wang from the centre for vision research at the university of sydney
3272095 its an opportunity to see damage that might be happening on the inside and help prevent it
3272096 that is a lot of people who may have early clues of a possible heart problem in their eyes
3272097 he will need to have access to this in order for us to proceed with this matter ms morgan said
3272098 we are having a bit of difficulty getting copies of the brief to the defendant in relation to prison regulations on fire safety
3272099 bhp and rio have both been quite strong its mostly that move in bhp and rio thats pushed the market into positive territory today
3272100 bhp has also come off quite a lot in the last few days so a few people are trying to pick the bottom on it
3272101 market conditions are obviously challenging and have adversely affected the capital markets division however collins stewart has three other business in hawkpoint securities and wealth management which are still operating profitably
3272102 there are few signs the slowdown as yet bottomed out
3272103 he was believed to be among the top leadership of al qaeda
3272104 dude are they going to do it to us again get first and second with none out and not score
3272105 hes got great stuff why doesnt he win more consistently
3272106 you have to swing early in the count against this guy tonight because hes throwing strikes up there and youre not going to get another good pitch to hit this is not how the yankees won four championships daniel cabrera owns the yankees this season and thats sad daniel cabrera is the quintessential dr jekyll and mr hyde sometimes he walks people all over the park and sometimes hes lights out
3272107 i dont care what you guys think i should be closing
3272108 without fully employing its abilities even at the final moment the imperial nation is surrendering before the enemies propaganda
3272109 i never imagined the torpor of the nations leaders and people
3272110 will come off as a complete loser by accepting unconditional surrender even if it makes a few demands
3272111 the purpose of the greater east asia war is to achieve a stable east asia for the survival and defence of the nation
3272112 the sacrifice of so many people who died in the war would go unrequited if this purpose remains unfulfilled
3272113 thirteen dead bodies and 15 injured have now been brought here
3272114 there were some paf civilians as well travelling in the vehicle we are trying to ascertain exactly how many were inside
3272115 we dont know whether it was a suicide attack or a roadside bomb
3272116 so far according to my information it was a security vehicle and an ied improvised explosive device was planted under the bridge
3272117 rentner m ssen arbeiten gehen immer mehr rentner in m nchen sind trotz ruhestandes auf einen job angewiesen um finanziell ber die runden zu kommen
3272118 if you dont try to win you might as well hold the olympics in somebodys back yard
3272119 theres nobody today that cannot find sugar if they want it
3272120 kind of a slap in the face to american producers
3272121 times are so critical to us its a matter of survival
3272122 our bankers are getting to be very nervous about loaning us money to make ends meet
3272123 a cloud over a sugar industry that has been dealing with depressed prices and soaring input costs for some time
3272124 we have price increases extremely rarely and theyre driven by what id call uncontrollable costs
3272125 we dont have price increases because my kid needs braces

3272136 the white people who just want to heal and move on what a luxury
3272137 i moved because i have black children and i need them to be in a place where the prevalent images arent of thug life and thug culture
3272138 i know there are people who want to fix the problems
3272139 we investigate these crimes and sometimes they are as they appear
3272140 obviously we have had a high profile murder in that neighborhood in recent history so the department is aware
3272141 but it is becoming even more so in a marketplace that is becoming more competitive and profit driven
3272142 now could we do that if we didnt have a world class faculty and a state of the art facility no wed be another county hospital of last resort
3272143 those hospitals were ones that only took care of patients that couldnt pay
3272144 safety net providers really are caught in the competitive crossfire of an increasingly profit driven health care marketplace
3272145 some of the steps they are taking to maintain their margins can threaten their mission
3272146 we have patients with charity care on every single service in this hospital
3272147 not for every single simple problem coming out of their communities

3272149 to me this answers the fundamental question of why chilies are hot in the first place
3272150 ive been able to make a career out of eating chilies
3272151 to make us healthier enhancing our own survival and reproduction
3272152 i have a very expensive machine in my lab that will do the same thing
3272153 the plant wants the right critter to eat the fruit
3272154 every time we go to a place in bolivia where theres a fence with cows on one side and not on the other
3272155 you find more plants that produce hot chilies on the cow side
3272156 die iren k nnten den anderen eu staaten mit ihrem
3272157 die eu k nnte zeigen dass sie eine lernende organisation ist und sich die gr e der kommission nochmals vornehmen
3272158 der vertrag von lissabon kann durch politische erkl rungen erg nzt werden um so auf die sorgen der irischen bev lkerung einzugehen
3272159 wir diskutieren seit mehr als sieben jahre ber einen reformvertrag die zukunft europas muss durch eine erfolgreiche ratifizierung bis zum fr hjahr n chsten jahres abgeschlossen werden damit sich die eu voll und ganz den gro en problemen zuwenden kann
3272160 wir berarbeiten jetzt den lissabonner vertrag wir machen die zust ndigkeiten eckiger und kantiger damit sie jeder erkennt und versteht damit es auch zust ndigkeits anma ungen nicht mehr gibt
3272161 wir m chten dabei so gut sein wie das beste nationale parlament
3272162 es gibt schwerwiegende risiken f r die gesundheit die mit ungen gendem sonnenschutz zusammenh ngen beispielsweise hautkrebs die eu b rgerinnen und b rger m ssen sich in vollem umfang ber nutzen und wirkung von sonnenschutzmitteln im klaren sein damit sie die richtigen entscheidungen treffen k nnen
3272163 unsere botschaft an die verbraucher in diesem sommer ist klar halten sie nach den neuen kennzeichen ausschau und w hlen sie in diesem sommer die sonnenschutzmittel f r sich und ihre familie in kenntnis der sachlage
3272164 tragen sie sonnenschutzmittel in ausreichender menge auf die richtige anwendung des mittels ist ebenso wichtig wie die wahl des produkts um den durch den lichtschutzfaktor angegebenen schutz zu erreichen muss eine menge von 2mg cm aufgetragen werden dies entspricht etwa 36 gramm 6 teel ffel sonnencreme f r den k rper eines erwachsenen
3272165 die neuen kennzeichnungen darunter ein neues uva logo oder siegel auf den flaschen und das verbot irref hrender ausdr cke wie sunblocker oder v lliger schutz sind die reaktion auf eine empfehlung der kommission ber sonnenschutzmittel vom september 2006
3272166 wir treffen uns am montag 21 juli und halten einen schwatz dar ber wie die dinge momentan liegen
3272167 our folks tell me it wasnt anything of the sort they merely placed a hand on his arm and escorted him out the door there was no force involved there was no struggle
3272168 sir could you please take your hands off me sir could you please take your hands off of me
3272169 you were advised not to come into the building this is private property if you come back in the building you will be arrested for trespassing do you understand that do you understand
3272170 but he wouldnt have to be escorted off the premises if he had just left when he was asked to i really think he was trying to provoke an incident by refusing to leave
3272171 its very important that when were involved in a political function that we have a clear distinction between on duty and off duty
3272172 i was cold cocked on the left side of my face by at least one if not three hells angels
3272173 i woke up on the ground pinned against a bar stool by a hells angel in a red bandanna
3272174 i was receiving fists and feet from the top during this
3272175 the iron pigs had been in there during the week and we never regarded them as trouble
3272176 they were well behaved the whole time they had been there they just seemed like normal guys who were riding harleys and having a few drinks
3272177 spinwatch ist eine nicht gewinnorientierte britische organisation die die rolle von

3272179 ich habe den bericht von andy rowell zur kenntnis genommen viele der gemachten behauptungen treffen nicht zu oder sind in einen falschen zusammenhang gebracht worden ich bin mit beginn meines mandats aus der f hrung der genannten unternehmen ausgeschieden was ich auch in meiner erkl rung der finanziellen interessen angegeben habe und was der autor ja best tigt ich habe zu den genannten unternehmen keine gesch ftsbeziehungen mehr
3272180 in belgien werden anteils nderungen in der regel nicht im handelsregister ver ffentlicht sondern in einem so genannten anteilsbuch festgehalten

3272182 the court needs a boost eighteen years is a long time especially for a person who has not had extensive experience before going on the bench
3272183 educability curiosity an ability to suspend disbelief and listen to the evidence or argument without predisposition to ensure that i am fully hearing and understanding someones position with open ears eyes and mind
3272184 we need justices who will stand up to the growth of government power over our lives and property more so now than ever what makes me unique is i have not spent my entire career in olympia advancing and defending this growth of power
3272185 meine untersuchung bezog sich nur auf das transparenz prinzip und nicht auf das prinzip der finanziellen rechenschaft f r das die haushaltskontrolle zust ndig ist ich bleibe bei meinem befund schlechter verwaltungspraxis ich habe aber anders als ein gericht nicht die m glichkeit die entscheidung des ep aufzuheben ich begr e die pl ne des ep die situation 2009 zu berpr fen sobald das neue abgeordneten statut in kraft getreten ist das ist jedoch keine entschuldigung f r seine aktuelle weigerung das gesetz einzuhalten
3272186 the european parliament has already adopted a series of major reforms to its system of allowances for members these amount to a substantial increase in transparency and will largely address the spirit of the ombudsmans remarks
3272187 parliament has noted with interest the comments of the european ombudsman in his decision on a complaint from a maltese journalist the report comes at a time when major changes to the expenses and allowances system are being introduced
3272188 ich bin kein anh nger eines unabh ngigen flanderns nicht jetzt und nicht morgen ich m chte weiterhin in einem f deralen rahmen funktionieren mit der beibehaltung der solidarit t zwischen den regionen
3272189 es stellt sich heraus dass die gegens tzlichen visionen der gemeinschaften ber ein erforderliches neues gleichgewicht im staatsaufbau heute unvereinbar sind
3272190 das kontrastiert freilich merkw rdig mit dem urteil praktisch aller kenner der beiden l nder sogar ein von der eu kommission bestelltes gutachten des belgischen staatsanwalts willem de pauw kam im november 2007 zu dem schluss dass es in rum nien statt fortschritten im kampf gegen die gro korruption an allen fronten r ckschritte gebe

3272193 verheugen mitarbeiterin erler kann nat rlich auch im r ckblick kein fehlverhalten erkennen dank der beitritte sei die region stabiler als damals auch ihre verw sserungsaktivit ten findet die beamtin keineswegs verwerflich
3272194 in wahrheit ermutigt br ssel nicht die v lker von bulgarien und rum nien sondern deren korrupte politeliten die b rger beider l nder sind die leidtragenden ein bekannter rum nischer journalist sagte mir k rzlich er selbst w re froh gewesen h tte die eu sein land 2007 nicht aufgenommen um den reformdruck aufrechtzuerhalten
3272195 ich komme selbst aus bulgarien und es besch mt mich zutiefst wie dort praktisch berall die korruption verbreitet ist fast bei jedem handeln bei jedem gesch ft bei jedem beh rdengang ja sogar bei einem arztbesuch kommt es vor dass man sich bedanken muss es sind nicht nur die politiker es sind einfach alle und berall beteiligt jeder versucht sich wie es nur geht zu bereichen koste es was es wolle der wilde kapitalismus hat einfach alle moralischen bedenken beiseite gefegt es z hlt nur das geld die kleinen ehrlichen leute sind die verlierer und werden nur ausgelacht es ist sehr traurig zu sehen wie keiner keinem vertraut die politiker sind genau so schlimm und arbeiten v llig verdient g nzlich ohne vertrauen da gibt es einfach keine alternative wir sind so tief gesunken dass wir selbst aus dem sumpf nicht herauskommen k nnen es ist sehr schade dass alles nicht viel sch rfer und konsequenter kritisiert und bem ngelt wird denn eine selbstreinigung ist nicht ihm sicht ich war urspr nglich sehr dagegen dass bulgarien in eu aufgenommen wird da wir es einfach nicht verdienen danach hoffte ich dass mit hilfe von au en zumindest eine umerziehung stattfinden w rde bis jetzt bleibt diese komplett aus wir haben solche r cksicht nicht verdient klar gibt es berall probleme in europa und wir sind nicht die ersten die entwicklungshilfe unterschlagen aber eins wei ich sich umzudrehen und das beste von allein zu erwarten wird definitiv helfen viel lieber alles publik machen und wenn n tig das gesamte geld sperren so eine schande
3272196 they can be dim when you first turn them on
3272197 the one above the closet she doesnt want to wait
3272198 to me this answers the fundamental question of why chilies are hot in the first place
3272199 ive been able to make a career out of eating chilies

3272205 although im an american citizen now my roots are there
3272206 being an asian american a chinese american i do feel a sense of pride that the olympics are being held in china
3272207 in a way my feelings are mixed if there were a team u s or china who would i cheer for
3272208 i hope they dont have to resort to any military or police action if there were to be protests
3272209 a lot of times we try to judge using our standard to them they sometimes dont feel its fair
3272210 put themselves on show to show their authority their glory
3272211 its just another communist propaganda show i dont feel like i want to be involved in that at all
3272212 i think you have to put it in the context of how much progress china has made in the past 40 years
3272213 rather than saying you havent done this you havent done that use some positive reinforcement
3272214 he was down and they used him as a food source they were puppies and didnt know any better
3272215 the lack of data to base a decision on has been frustrating
3272216 its nice to have the record but its really more about challenging myself and doing something ive dreamed about for years
3272217 when you climb this mountain as much as we climb it you start looking for a challenge
3272218 its just like any endurance sport going out to see what your body is capable of
3272219 ill just have to try and steal it back from you next year
3272220 thats the beauty of it its not an established event
3272221 its just going out there and seeing what you can do that day that mountain that weather

3272223 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
3272224 colaboratory takes place over 6 weeks in portland oregon 10 participants are selected and individually paired with 3 of the 11 agencies based on their strengths and interests interns spend 2 intensely focused weeks at each agency learning from all disciplines
3272225 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
3272226 we are all in disbelief at this tragic end to such a bright light in our community
3272227 are thinking the baby was less than a day old
3272228 it took prodding from congress to persuade the cftc to finally request information from swap dealers about the participation of sovereign wealth funds in the commodity markets
3272229 the regulatory body in charge of policing our futures markets has been remarkably incurious about the role sovereign wealth funds play in commodity markets
3272230 the growth of sovereign wealth funds and their collective investment in u s markets is of interest to a number of u s regulators
3272231 not observed any positions of sovereign wealth funds in the data received to date
3272232 are causing a colossal impact on the markets and we dont have the right team to oversee and analyze whether the consumer is being protected
3272233 banking on this being too complicated for anyone to understand
3272234 will provide clarity and certainty to the consultation process under the endangered species act
3272235 i am deeply troubled by this proposed rule which gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3272236 eleventh hour rule makings rarely if ever lead to good government this is not the type of legacy this interior department should be leaving for future generations
3272237 clearly thats a case of asking the fox to guard the chicken coop
3272238 a giant caution light that made federal agencies stop and think about the impacts of their actions
3272239 what the bush administration is telling those agencies is they dont have to think about those impacts anymore
3272240 we have to have the ability to put our efforts where theyre needed
3272241 this really says to the agencies this law belongs to all of us youre responsible to defend it
3272242 because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3272243 so we dont inadvertently have the endangered species act seen as a back door to climate change policy that was never ever intended
3272244 clarity on an issue that if it was left broad and ambiguous could be a serious problem for the home building industry here in california
3272245 for home builders clarity in the rules is always always helpful
3272246 encouragement from both sides of the aisle to see if we couldnt bring about steps that would make the endangered species act more effective
3272247 another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3272248 i believe it is illegal and if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3272249 increasingly there are no limits technologically as to what a company can do in terms of collecting information and then selling it as a commodity to other providers
3272250 our responsibility is to make sure that we create a law that regardless of the technology includes a set of legal guarantees that consumers have with respect to their information
3272251 insight into the number of people who have seen an ad campaign
3272252 how many users visited their sites after seeing an ad
3272253 google is slowly embracing a full blown behavioral targeting over its vast network of services and sites
3272254 people are starting to see oh we have these different industries that are collecting the same types of information to profile individuals and the devices they use on the network
3272255 internet cellphones cable any way you tap into the network concerns are raised
3272256 a broad approach to protecting peoples online privacy seems both desirable and inevitable
3272257 advertisers and data collectors who record where customers go and what they do want profit at the expense of privacy
3272258 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3272259 the tax system that allows this wholesale tax avoidance is an embarrassment and unfair to hardworking americans who pay their fair share of taxes we need to plug these tax loopholes and put these corporations back on the tax rolls
3272260 this report makes clear that too many corporations are using tax trickery to send their profits overseas and avoid paying their fair share in the united states
3272261 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3272262 the russian government must reverse the course that it appears to be on
3272263 today the statehood of georgia is in great danger and thereby leaving existing world order in uncertainty
3272264 russia seems intent on overthrowing the democratically elected government of georgia and occupying the country
3272265 the cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several us diplomats it is a real shame
3272266 russian aggression must not go unanswered and its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3272267 people are in panic this road where the troops are is about two kilometers from the center
3272268 this is an occupation half of georgia is under russian control our aim now is to build up our troops and to create a defensive line in front of tbilisi
3272269 this was the largest hacking and theft of credit and debit card information ever successfully investigated and prosecuted within the united states
3272270 represents serious and substantial legal and factual challenges for the government to prove at trial
3272271 in order to infiltrate those organizations you have to be established
3272272 you cannot just get on criminal boards and start dealing with high level players he provided us with that ability to do that on shadowcrew
3272273 here is the attorney general of the united states announcing the charges against your son and telling the whole world that he is looking at life in prison
3272274 we were always trying to get law enforcement to go after these guys for us
3272275 over the last two or three years the secret service has devoted lots of time to it this at least sends a message to the criminal side that there are folks coming after you even if you are operating outside the united states
3272276 pervez has insulted and compromised pakistans sovereignty by allowing the cia and fbi to operate freely in pakistan and arrest interrogate torture deport and detain any person whether pakistani or not for as long as they like thus turning the pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade
3272277 the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilize this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america
3272278 something bordering on disbelief when he discovers that we extend the sphere of partisan control to the selection and preparation of experts
3272279 the others biased for the state i think its whos signing their paycheck
3272280 theyre usually offsetting as far as their opinions are concerned
3272281 you feel like you need a shower theyre asking you to be certain of things you cant be certain of
3272282 you can feel the release of the tension which normally infects the evidence gathering process
3272283 are able to more effectively respond to the views of the other expert or experts
3272284 assuming the judge has an active interest in ferreting out the truth and the experts are candid i prefer the hot tubbing option
3272285 but those are two bold assumptions and the procedure drives the attorneys nuts
3272286 judges think that if we could just have a place in the adversarial trial that was a little less adversarial and a little more scientific everything would be fine
3272287 the culture of confrontation that permeated the use of experts in litigation
3272288 there is this proprietary interest lawyers here have over lawsuits
3272289 to put it bluntly in many professions service as an expert witness is not considered honest work
3272290 the contempt of lawyers and judges for experts is famous they regularly describe expert witnesses as prostitutes
3272291 experts abandon objectivity and become advocates for the side that hires them
3272292 many judges if not most have been trial lawyers and they are suspicious that any expert is truly neutral
3272293 the virtue of our system is that it allows people to sort of balance things out

3272317 the most surprising thing about the late merge concept is that it showed
3272318 section 377 of the ipc which criminalise men who have sex with men must go
3272319 i hope that the minister will now persuade his more medieval minded cabinet colleagues and make them understand that human rights are universal and one cannot be discriminated against for sexual orientation
3272320 in spite of section 377 homosexuals have continued to live love and have sex in india so it is really immaterial to the ipc act it has only stigmatised and made homosexuals more vulnerable thereby increasing their risks of contracting hiv which ultimately is a public health concern
3272321 it will help not only the homosexuals in india but also in several neighbouring countries where the practice is being considered as a crime
3272322 our march will show that while the rest of india had achieved independence on 15 august 1947 gay indians were still bound by a rule made by the britishers nearly 150 years ago
3272323 the statement from ramadoss will certainly help the cause of the gay community but it is sad that the law ministry is indecisive over the issue
3272324 ramadoss has touched a politically sensitive subject though this comment may not lead to a debate in parliament it might influence the judges a bit as they too are humans and are vulnerable to the sufferings of others
3272325 but none so much as when i excused my passions in the name of god

3272331 prinsip utama riba adalah penambahan menurut syariah riba berarti penambahan atas harta pokok tanpa adanya transaksi bisnis riil
3272332 riba adalah tambahan yang disyaratkan dalam transaksi bisnis tanpa adanya iwadh atau padanan yang dibenarkan syariah atas penambahan tersebut
3272333 hai orang orang yang beriman janganlah kamu memakan riba dengan berlipat ganda dan bertaqwalah kamu kepada allah supaya kamu mendapat keberuntungan qs 3 130
3272334 dan disebabkan mereka memakan riba padahal sesungguhnya mereka telah melarang dari padanya dan karena mereka memakan harta orang dengan jalan yang bathil kami telah menyediakan untuk orang orang yang kafir di antara mereka itu siksa yang pedih

3272349 it seems the eyes could be a window to look at the condition of small vessels throughout the body including the heart said lead researcher dr jie jin wang from the centre for vision research at the university of sydney
3272350 its an opportunity to see damage that might be happening on the inside and help prevent it
3272351 that is a lot of people who may have early clues of a possible heart problem in their eyes
3272352 and people that are found to have retinopathy should be kept on watch for further heart check ups in the future dr wang said

3272361 hes very elusive hes had no fixed address for the longest time hes got addresses listed where he doesnt live hes just kind of couch surfing the last address he gave us was a false address we actually found the right address but then found out he had been there and left and we didnt have a forwarding address for him
3272362 we actually won a lot today theres no injunction and we get to cross examine the mayor in the past the city has refused to put forward affidavits from the mayor and former deputy city manager brent mcgregor and city engineer tom timm without an affidavit i cant cross examine them
3272363 rather than hearing this matter yesterday and then repeating it again in october were just going to do it in october once its a matter of more efficient use of court resources and also two months at this stage doesnt make a difference
3272364 if they want to protest and they want to hold a demonstration and they want to stand there with a poster or placard or banner theyre entitled to do that what they are not entitled to do what nobody is entitled to do is build permanent structures on city streets without the citys permission
3272365 the situation that is most comparable is the squatters on city streets outside of the woodwards building which resulted in an injunction its the same section of the city bylaw that was enforced then and its the same section thats being enforced now

3272370 he certainly likes his new portfolio a lot and that may have something to do with that
3272371 in his eyes he was either going to die or go to jail he chose to die
3272372 he said he would rather die than go back to jail
3272373 and i knew he was serious too hes been in jail before and ive seen him in jail and i knew he wasnt coming back
3272374 we do believe because of his mental frame of mind that yes he may have crossed the centre line intentionally to take his own life and unfortunately did take the life of another man with him
3272375 quite often when he gets depressed he would stop taking medications
3272376 whether or not he was on medication yesterday i dont know he does take them most of the time
3272377 we tried to find him one but its like a couple year wait to get into a facility
3272378 hes a very nice guy very talkative very open to everybody very helpful any time you needed a hand he was there right away to help

3272393 section 377 of the ipc which criminalise men who have sex with men must go
3272394 i hope that the minister will now persuade his more medieval minded cabinet colleagues and make them understand that human rights are universal and one cannot be discriminated against for sexual orientation
3272395 in spite of section 377 homosexuals have continued to live love and have sex in india so it is really immaterial to the ipc act it has only stigmatised and made homosexuals more vulnerable thereby increasing their risks of contracting hiv which ultimately is a public health concern

3272397 our review has clearly revealed the weaknesses associated with the integrated one firm business model some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months

3272399 we have substantially reduced our risk exposures balance sheet costs and personnel made changes in our group governance model and initiated remediation measures i am determined to make the management of ubs more effective

3272402 we expect growth in industrial production to accelerate to 10 per cent in 2008 09 compared to the 8 3 per cent growth recorded in 2007 08
3272403 the recent trends reflected in the index of industrial production iip have raised anxieties of a slowdown in industrial activity
3272404 we believe that industrial growth has slowed because of capacity constraints and inflation is high because demand is high
3272405 the industry is creating fresh capacities at an aggressive pace and as these new capacities get commissioned supplies would increase to meet the soaring demand as a result we believe that the current slowdown seen in the iip numbers is a short term phenomenon that would be reversed by the middle of 2008 09
3272406 we cannot tolerate a sanctuary for al qaida we will ask more of the pakistani government rather than offer a blank cheque to an undemocratic president
3272407 the greatest threat to security in afghanistan and america lies in the tribal regions of pakistan where terrorists train and plot attacks and then strike and move back across the border
3272408 we need a stronger and sustained partnership between afghanistan pakistan and the nato including necessary assets like satellites and predator drones to secure the border by wiping out terrorist camps and cracking down on cross border insurgents
3272409 hate crime by extremists is met with an agenda of hope

3272434 its a rather dismal picture of the health of the cities listed by forbes
3272435 but as pointed out by some government officials the numbers discussed in the report are from 2000 2005 and dont reflect whats been happening more recently it is very difficult to assess the current situation in the us just by analyzing past data
3272436 the employment outlook as revealed by forbes com is based on outdated facts and figures which have only partial relevance to recent times the manufacturing sector is going through troubled times but there isnt the dearth of manufacturing jobs reported by forbes manufacturingcrossing has recently posted more than 17 000 us manufacturing jobs in its database and this is a testament to the fact that if one searches in the right places one is sure to end up with a job

3272443 developing trust is the first task of the ego and it is never complete the child will let its mother out of sight without anxiety and rage because she has become an inner certainty as well as an outer predictability the balance of trust with mistrust depends largely on the quality of the maternal relationship
3272444 erikson proposed that the concept of trust versus mistrust is present throughout an individuals entire life therefore if the concept is not addressed taught and handled properly during infancy when it is first introduced an individual may be negatively affected and never fully immerse themselves in the world for example a person may hide themselves from the outside world and be unable to form healthy and long lasting relationships with others or even themselves if an individual does not learn to trust themselves others and the world they may lose the virtue of hope which is directly linked to this concept if a person loses their belief in hope they will struggle with overcoming hard times and failures in their lives and may never fully recover from them this would prevent them from learning and maturing into a fully developed person if the concept of trust versus mistrust was improperly learned understood and used in all aspects of their lives

3272459 capcom has also always been strong partners with nvidia and with bionic commando we are taking things to a new level by adding gpu accelerated physx to increase the titles realism
3272460 physics is changing the industry we evaluated all of the commercial physics systems out there for gaming and the choice was easy
3272461 nvidia physx runs faster than other solutions and it works across pcs and consoles which is important to us because bionic commando will ship on all major platforms we believe physx will help make the game seem even more lifelike and immersive
3272462 the gaming industry and gamers themselves are excited to see the return of bionic commando the addition of physics effects using physx technology is going to add a huge amount of extra fun and depth to the game play

3272510 giving up without even trying i mean if you want to write if you honestly feel you have something to say then do it everyone should at least try to do the thing he wants to do later in life situations and responsibilities force people to compromise but to compromise now its like quitting before you start
3272511 can believe anything you have no idea what i can believe
3272512 i can believe things that are true and i can believe things that arent true and i can believe things where nobody knows if theyre true or not i can believe in santa claus and the easter bunny and marilyn monroe and the beatles and elvis and mister ed listen i believe that people are perfectible that knowledge is infinite that the world is run by secret banking cartels and is visited by aliens on a regular basis nice ones that look like wrinkledy lemurs and bad ones who mutilate cattle and want our water and our women i believe that the future sucks and i believe that the future rocks and i believe that one day white buffalo woman is going to come back and kick everyones ass i believe that all men are just overgrown boys with deep problems communicating and that the decline in good sex in america is coincident with the decline in drive in movie theaters from state to state i believe that all politicians are unprincipled crooks and i still believe that they are better than the alternative i believe that california is going to sink into the sea when the big one comes while florida is going to dissolve into madness and alligators and toxic waste i believe that antibacterial soap is destroying our resistance to dirt and disease so that one day well all be wiped out by the common cold like the martians in war of the worlds i believe that the greatest poets of the last century were edith sitwell and don marquis that jade is dried dragon sperm and that thousands of years ago in a former life i was a one armed siberian shaman i believe that mankinds destiny lies in the stars i believe that candy really did taste better when i was a kid that its aerodynamically impossible for a bumblebee to fly that light is a wave and a particle that theres a cat in a box somewhere whos alive and dead at the same time although if they dont ever open the box to feed it itll eventually just be two different kinds of dead and that there are stars in the universe billions of years older than the universe itself i believe in a personal god who cares about me and worries and oversees everything i do i believe in an impersonal god who set the universe in motion and went off to hang with her girlfriends and doesnt even know that im alive i believe in an empty and godless universe of causal chaos background noise and sheer blind luck i believe that anyone who says that sex is overrated just hasnt done it properly i believe that anyone who claims to know whats going on will lie about the little things too i believe in absolute honesty and sensible social lies i believe in a womans right to choose a babys right to live that while all human life is sacred theres nothing wrong with the death penalty if you can trust the legal system implicitly and that no one but a moron would ever trust the legal system i believe that life is a game that life is a cruel joke and that life is what happens when youre alive and that you might as well lie back and enjoy it
3272513 okay so if i tell you what ive learned you wont think that im a nut
3272514 would you believe that all the gods that people have ever imagined are still with us today and that there are new gods out there gods of computers and telephones and whatever and that they all seem to think there isnt room for them both in the world and that some kind of war is kind of likely

3272521 non violent drug offenses are being over prosecuted and corporate crime is being under prosecuted
3272522 the justice department must begin to reverse course crank up the crackdown on corporate crime and end the cruel and inhumane war on non violent drug possession
3272523 the criminal justice system is broken so badly that one hardly knows where to begin describing the breakdown
3272524 lets start with the war on drugs since commentators across the political spectrum recognize its lunacy we pour almost endless resources roughly 50 billion every year into catching trying and incarcerating people who primarily harm themselves this insane war on drugs damages communities and drains crucial resources from the police courts and prisons these resources could be better used to combat serious street and corporate crime that directly violates the publics liberty health safety trust and financial well being as with alcoholics and nicotine addicts the approach to drug addicts should be rehabilitation not incarceration
3272525 the current drug policy has consumed tens of billions of dollars and wrecked countless lives
3272526 the costs of this policy include the increasing breakdown of families and neighborhoods endangerment of children widespread violation of civil liberties escalating rates of incarceration political corruption and the imposition of united states policy abroad in practice the drug war disproportionately targets people of color and people who are poverty stricken coercive measures have not reduced drug use but they have clogged our criminal justice system with non violent offenders it is time to explore alternative approaches and to end this costly war
3272527 probably would not have gone on to have the career you have had
3272528 it is urgent that the u s reverse the incarceration binge the u s department of justice estimates that if incarceration rates remain unchanged an estimated one of every 20 americans and greater than one in four african americans can be expected to serve time in prison during their lifetime
3272529 it is time to make the failed war on drugs a central issue in the american political dialogue for too long we have let this injustice continue to grow unhindered taking action on clemency at the federal level will set an example for the states and begin the process of reversing this failed policy
3272530 the current cruel unjust policy perpetuated and enforced by the bush administration prevents americans who suffer from debilitating illnesses from experiencing the relief of medicinal cannabis
3272531 while substantial scientific and anecdotal evidence exists to validate marijuanas usefulness in treating disease a deluge of rhetoric from washington claims that marijuana has no medicinal value
3272532 in need of alternative crops and aware of the growing market for industrial hemp particularly for bio composite products such as automobile parts farmers in the united states are forced to watch from the sidelines while canadian french and chinese farmers grow the crop and american manufacturers import it from them
3272533 there now is a significant and growing backlog of criminal investigations and unresolved matters
3272534 it is such a relief to have our post back we are all very happy
3272535 i am delighted for the residents of booze that my initiative in convening the meeting has resulted in them getting their postal deliveries back and i am pleased that the county council has been key in facilitating this welcome return
3272536 i hope also that booze regaining its postal deliveries removes the sword of damocles that was hanging over a dozen or more other small communities in the upper dales
3272537 any improvements to access roads in the booze area are welcomed by royal mail
3272538 nicola was always swimming and joanne used to get dragged along to the practices and i think in the end she just thought if i cant beat her ill have to join her
3272539 we had no idea she would become an olympic medal winner she showed no extraordinary swimming talent as a child and everything she has achieved has been through sheer hard work
3272540 she did a lot of soul searching about whether to carry on with it and this was the test really she is absolutely over the moon
3272541 i didnt really know what to expect this morning because it was a hard swim last night to get into the final
3272542 for two british girls to get on the podium is amazing and i am so happy for both of us its great for british swimming
3272543 we spoke to her on the phone just after the race and she was absolutely ecstatic
3272544 darlingtons performance in science at gcse is at the national average and although students do a combined or dual award they still go on to do well at a level
3272545 last year 34 per cent of those who took a level physics got an a grade
3272546 although we have a vast discrepancy between the performance of secondary schools in darlington we have pupils in all of them of outstanding ability
3272547 it is disconcerting to find out that compared with almost the rest of the country none of our young people decided to pursue physics
3272548 has this situation developed due to the availability of qualified teachers the careers advice given to young people at this critical stage the greater difficulty in obtaining good results in this subject or the fact that extra lessons have to be taken after school
3272549 we want to prepare young people coming out of education with skills to maximise their potential in working lives
3272550 whilst it is true that fewer than a quarter of hartlepool students last year chose to take all four of these subjects in combination those who did performed very well
3272551 sixty nine per cent of them achieved a to c grades in all four of the subjects against a national average of 52 5 per cent
3272552 we should also point out that a modern language is not compulsory at key stage four
3272553 we are very proud of the achievements of hartlepools schools and working in partnership with our schools we continue to do everything we can to further raise standards
3272554 the matter is now with police and as such we are unable to give more details to explain our decisions
3272555 however we are confident in our processes that we acted appropriately and that we remain focused on the safety and security of our passengers and crew
3272556 i would at least expect thomsons security to let newcastle know there was an issue straightaway
3272557 i would also expect a message to be relayed back to newcastle from the air traffic controllers of the air spaces the plane passes through
3272558 this years annual report shows that the nhs in the north east has a lot to be proud of as it has some of the best healthcare in the country
3272559 this achievement is without doubt down to the drive and dedication of staff working at all levels of the nhs
3272560 this year he has been doing his mating display to everyone and everybody more exaggerated than i have ever seen really going to town
3272561 he sits back on his haunches grunts a lot and flaps his wings we have had a lot of people asking if the vulture is all right if he is having a fit but really he had taken a fancy to them
3272562 people get a bit shocked when you tell them it is just that he has taken to them
3272563 at night barry walks through the door to his own aviary and i think he is quite glad to do so
3272564 she is a bit full of it she follows him around all the time steals his food and pecks his backside
3272565 he is a lovely intelligent bird he is ugly which is not unusual for vultures but is very sensitive and easily gets upset
3272566 if you give him meat on the bone he tends to get paranoid that the bone is going to get him back
3272567 he will sneak up behind it he is a very sensitive soul
3272568 it is surprising how he has taken to her we expected more aggression but it seems he realises he was a vulture all along
3272569 this is very much a collaborative approach using the expertise of local companies universities and clinicians thanks to major government funding
3272570 our aim is to develop a dressing which not only helps the wound heal but tells clinicians about the underlying state of the wound for example it is infected
3272571 it is made up of a scaffold coated with a special gel which has properties that allow sampling of the wound without disrupting healing
3272572 the gel can then be removed and put into a machine for testing while the scaffold stays in place
3272573 we are at the very earliest stages of development but our ultimate aim is to test it on patients predominantly it would be used in plastic and reconstruction surgery but if successful it could have huge implications for wound management and be used for acute and chronic wounds chronic diabetic leg ulcers and traumatic front of leg ulcers
3272574 i was very surprised to have won especially for the third time david copland of darlington building society said
3272575 we are pleased to be able to help any parts of the local community and regularly supply tickets to various disabled and educational groups
3272576 i am delighted to have won the trophy again it will look good on my cv
3272577 i am hoping to join the foreign office but it would also be nice to go pro and entertain with my magic as well
3272578 tom is a young man going far his win was well deserved

3272661 to live is to pray an introduction to carmelite spirituality
3272662 the mortality of the post war generation of american novelists
3272663 when a solipsist dies after all everything goes with him
3272664 when did it happen that in this country that the formative novelist the great novelist is mark twain when did it happen that american letters became possessed of precious little stories instead of big boisterous stories that fit the temper of the country itself
3272665 she was always pretty friendly she had a little jack russell who would come down the road and bark at you
3272666 it was big flames coming there are a lot of people in the neighborhood who dont think monday nights events played out exactly the way
3272667 my purpose this morning is to ask our heavenly father to bless you with the instinctive desire to plead with him in prayer that you might arrive at the point in your life when you can consistently think straight for straight thinkers my brothers and sisters do not make serious mistakes in life those who think straight do not have moral problems those who think straight really do not have problems with the word of wisdom they dont have problems paying tithing they dont have problems with being righteous and good
3272668 it is testament to the hard work of everyone involved that we have been able to confirm an alternative venue for the mountain biking competition only seven months after the venue change was announced
3272669 in hadleigh farm we have a world class venue for games time with the potential for an excellent facility for elite and community use post games
3272670 holy sh t this cant be right this is the first notice i received and it says i already owe a fine of 1 5 souls i dont have 1 5 souls
3272671 oooo they must really have something on you these guys dont pick up every sorry hellbound tom dick or harriet
3272672 i havent done anything not really we need to take care of this before they get here
3272673 look this is all a misunderstanding heres the demon you can just take him now
3272674 why dont i send my servant here down to wait in line and get this straightened out when the final decision is made just let me know and ill pay whatever i owe
3272675 you cant predict turning the corner but i think hes got a lot left in the tank for whatever we have left
3272676 he looks strong hes locating and we will need him to do that
3272677 the way danks was throwing you dont want them to spread out or get an extra run because his stuff was so good
3272678 everything was working he was throwing changeup he was throwing fastball cutter curveball he had everything working but beckett kept him to 1 gave us a chance
3272679 when it came off the bat i knew i had a hit out of it just the way it came off just kind of stayed through it kind of floated over into center field it probably helped me if i had hit it harder might have gone to the center fielder
3272680 the good part of it was it was a 1 0 lead you always feel like youre a hit or a walk away
3272681 tonight it was just staying pitch to pitch not getting too far ahead
3272682 i wasnt thinking about the 0 and 2 pitch when i was 0 and 0 sometimes its easy to do that you start thinking about the result maybe that corrupts the process i think im staying good with staying with the process
3272683 to turn things around here we need to start with pitching
3272684 he was clean today with his delivery balls were going where he wanted them to hes had to fight that quite a bit throughout different parts of the year no better time than now to figure it out
3272685 i think everybody felt it was kind of a breakout year for him
3272686 ive heard his name a lot not like somebodys beating my door down but if you look at the reports hes done well
3272687 this seems like a really good opportunity to let him pitch hes been throwing the ball well the idea will be to slow the rangers down a little bit
3272688 now its finally to the point where im not ever worried about throwing a ball full counts ill throw a knuckleball still i dont worry about walking people anymore
3272689 a lot of it is me just having to believe in it i always wanted to go back to throwing hard now i know i cant do that anymore so i have to be able to figure it out to throw consistent knuckleballs up there that will move and hopefully not get hit hard
3272690 he pitches a lot like wake as far as he throws his knuckleball for strikes when he gets behind 2 and 0 3 and 1 he is still committed to throwing a knuckleball thats big if youre not doing that you are going to get in trouble throwing 80 mile per hour fastballs
3272691 i think tom kind of concurred with what everybody else thought
3272692 it was probably a good idea that he not pitch we maybe hopefully stayed ahead of this thing and that given the few days down from throwing get him back up and get him back there was nothing that stood out structurally or anything like that on the mri
3272693 i think weve really been so committed to this guy and i understand were seeing it too
3272694 last year when he was pitching against baltimore it looked so easy well right now its not easy youre playing good major league teams and theyre doing everything in their power to find a way to exploit anything you do
3272695 so were kind of trying to balance trying to help and not beating him over the head with stuff thats actually not the easiest thing but were spending some time talking to him about things just trying to make progress
3272696 instead of trying to get in that rhythm of attacking the strike zone
3272697 id like to play him every single day because hes a big threat but i think we both thought it was the right day not to play
3272698 i just got a fastball that got a little in
3272699 i just kind of took a swing that got in on me a little bit luckily it got over the shortstops head
3272700 he threw me a really good pitch the first pitch of the at bat
3272701 i just tried to stay on it and drive the ball
3272702 j d drew is one of the best hitters this year in baseball i left the ball out over the plate and he did what he is supposed to do
3272703 i was upset with myself you dont ever want to give up a lead like that especially late in the game with beckett doing what he was doing
3272704 youkilis is a good hitter it wasnt the only hit i gave up if it had been the only hit then you might start thinking about it
3272705 the kid was throwing the ball really well one hitter turned everything around
3272706 c mo se llama esa danza que bailamos al fin
3272707 hey if you want to live in a subdivision and drive everywhere thats fine but you have to pay the costs of your own negative externalities
3272708 but i cant tell my best friend that we were trying to avoid having another baby she says the church teaches that nfp can only be used when having another child would cause some kind of disaster in the family
3272709 he felt as though the role was impacting on his own personal performance and that was affecting the team
3272710 it is a brave decision by rikki and he deserves respect for putting the team and the club ahead of his own personal ambitions as a captain
3272711 he hasnt played as well as he would have liked since joining us he moved from the county he has spent his whole career during the winter and he and his partner harriet have had their first child this summer
3272712 that is an awful lot to be going on for any player and rikki felt it was best for everyone concerned if he gave up the captaincy
3272713 if we play like we played this week we will beat australia but its going to take a lot to do it
3272714 this was a one off it was a very exciting stage a starting stage and the most important thing will be to turn up to every single test match like weve done this week
3272715 my main driving force for this team is to be every single day up for the challenge of improving having no comfort zones and testing the guys out to perform every single day
3272716 ive done a lot of thinking over the last few days
3272717 you do find yourself thinking about the game more and scenarios
3272718 ive certainly done some thinking about australia next year a lot more than when i would have when i was a player because you want to get the structure right so guys can play in certain positions feel comfortable know their role and deliver
3272719 it will be important over the next nine months to learn their roles and then deliver
3272720 he said he would see but the travel has always been the problem for steve being away from his family
3272721 i respect the man for the decisions he makes and it would be lovely to have him coming in first change with the white ball but you dont always get what you want in life
3272722 weve seen this week how important hes going to be for us hes a huge player im going to be looking after steve as much as i can but also making sure i get the best out of him and i think i know the sort of ways to do it
3272723 whatever i say i dont want to take anything away from englands victory
3272724 i think they were motivated but i think they came out and played the better cricket in the game
3272725 i think the emotion that we felt after winning at edgbaston was always going to be difficult to re invent and bring into this game and i think that showed in the way we performed
3272726 we would play well for an hour and a bit then wed lose our way a bit and i think maybe that showed in terms of the series having been won how much it meant to us at edgbaston

3272762 es una respuesta del gobierno a los grandes desaf os en materia de transporte p blico en la capital del pa s la inversi n de las tres etapas del tren suburbano ser de alrededor de 30 mil millones de pesos transportar anualmente a 78 millones de usuarios
3272763 estamos tambi n matando varios p jaros de un tiro
3272764 si estamos pasando de tres horas diarias perdidas o utilizadas en transportarse primero en el pesero o en el micro y luego en el metro y luego otra vez en el cami n etc tera con estas vialidades se reducir n a tan s lo 40 minutos quiere decir que por lo menos le estamos ahorrando diariamente a millones de personas dos horas dos horas que podr an emplear para estar con su familia con sus hijos para estudiar para descansar en fin dos horas merecidas para mejor calidad de vida
3272765 con este tren suburbano vamos a poner a la zona metropolitana de la ciudad de m xico a la altura de las urbes m s importantes del mundo

3272767 mientras m s autoridades nos sumemos para poder abatir los costos ser mucho m s factible hacerlos accesibles incluso no excluye este sistema la posibilidad que de acuerdo con la pol tica p blica asumida por cada nivel de gobierno una autoridad estatal o municipal espec ficamente pueda orientar determinados apoyos espec ficos hacia gente que lo considere conveniente
3272768 s puedo asegurar que la estructura financiera de los trenes suburbanos lo que est buscando es construir las obras y aparte trasladarle al usuario al menor costo posible un costo que permita construir las obras recuperar inversi n y operaci n y al mismo tiempo darle servicio a la gente

3272812 the governor is right that they need to act now that the deficit is only going to get worse
3272813 but there will be big resistance in the legislature particularly in the assembly
3272814 we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views respected

3272826 while new jersey does have these two competitive races it is important to remember that this is still a deeply democratic state where republican candidates are financially challenged
3272827 in the 7th you have a republican nominee in leonard lance 3rd the story continues with state sen john adler sitting on a huge financial advantage
3272828 new jersey hasnt elected a republican to the senate for 36 years and it is likely the status quo will continue
3272829 every four years this state has moments where new jersey looks competitive but it is important to remember that a republican hasnt won statewide since 1997 in the meantime all 49 other states have

3272879 you cant just walk in and say hi president monson here we are
3272880 in his sights a true story of love and obsession
3272881 where if my car and my house hadnt been tampered with and i hadnt gotten a threatening phone call and id been able to do my work that was a good day
3272882 felt like the one thing i could do that had any possibility of minimizing the danger
3272883 i find a bar of soap from the second floor bathroom on the third floor kitchen counter
3272884 a teaspoon from a kitchen drawer lies on the middle of my bed
3272885 ive actually worked cases as a police investigator where the offender would do similarly bizarre things
3272886 its the constant behavior that the offender wants the victim to know im here and i can get to you
3272887 but what they came up with was what i thought they would which was what could be proven which was really that he moved in across the street from me
3272888 there was a point at which i thought this is the biggest story in my life right now and if it were anything else i would be writing a book about it and am i going to give that to him too and i decided no
3272889 i dont want to heighten the risk to me and or people close to me by forcing his hand
3272890 she had the sense that the onus is on you to prove your story
3272891 i dont have any expectation that i would ever in a legal way that i would have any justice
3272892 thats not even in the realm of what i think will happen in my life
3272893 much more fun to just mess with me and spoil my life in this way and constantly remind me i cant get rid of him that hes got control over me

3272895 conversion to islam article 121 1a of the federal constitution subashini amp shamala revisited
3272896 an avenue for the respective speakers to market their ideas which would be followed by fruitful discussions by the members of the floor
3272897 be that as it may when the muslims vehemently protested such forum i have with the greatest respect a difficulty to understand the reasons of such protest
3272898 while we the muslims are entitled to protect and defend our religion we must also at the same time be just and tolerant in our stand
3272899 unfortunately even without such knowledge some have protested for the sake of protest
3272900 it is rather puzzling the protesters did not condemn a mediocre leader of umno mohd ali rustam when he suggested to use isa to detain the organiser of the forum i dare say isa is more dangerous and wicked than the said forum
3272901 thus it is fit and proper to organise a forum to discuss the said case and all the issues raised
3272902 he or she has no other option but to go to the syariah court to get his earlier marriage dissolved
3272903 with this kind of forum the muslim speakers may inter alia be able to highlight to the non muslim that even muslims are discriminated against when they choose to embrace islam
3272904 when two out of the said three speakers pulled out from the forum at the eleventh hour the inescapable conclusion was the muslim scholars were not ready to engage intellectually with other non muslim speakers in that forum the pulling out with respect was not the good option
3272905 it was also the best opportunity for the muslims to engage intellectually with the non muslims muslims dont have to be apologetic in such a forum
3272906 as such article 11 was rightly protested by the muslims as it sought to drive home a message that muslim in this country have the right to murtad and such right is protected by article 11 of the federal constitution many muslims rightly believed that article 11 was created to pursue the ifcs unsuccessful agenda
3272907 it is high time for muslims to engage intellectually with non muslims we must show our non muslims brothers and sisters that islam promotes dialogue and intellectual discourse

3272913 nbc is spending more than 1 billion to broadcast the olympic games to the u s they believe footage available on other web sites would take away their audience
3272914 expands to any footage filmed within the accredited area or interviews conducted within the accredited area
3272915 an irish person via a mobile phone and they happened to be in an official olympic car we cannot play that interview outside of ireland
3272916 realistically this means we need to block all live streams radio and television because we cannot monitor all of the streams 24 hours
3272917 its not even common for the olympics no other sporting event in the world requires this level of restrictions including the 2004 games
3272918 were making more of these olympics available to american audiences by far than any olympics in history
3272919 im alan yeah i just got into an argument with my drunk wife
3272920 i saw them as a tribe that i wanted to study

3272922 it seemed like a very half assed confession and i think it was unchivalrous of him to basically say that he wasnt in love with her i think he has some more explaining to do although on the other hand the sooner this is all behind us the better
3272923 i think shes a wonderful girl and she has a good heart and shes a good person i still wish her well

3272942 was issued on 7 to promote the album with the edited single version added here as a bonus track but failed to chart despite being assured polished folk rock enhanced by some haunting flute however in the context of the album its another fine track amongst pretty consistent material
3272943 possesses a chorus that just gets into your head and is delivered with such infectious euphoria that i cant help thinking how unjust it is that farr who died in 1994 is mostly celebrated online as a member of 1960s british r amp b band

3273000 to allow our shareholders to benefit from any increased value i have decided to terminate my current effort to acquire usanas operating assets on the terms previously announced
3273001 we can potentially invest in acquisitions about 600 700 million euros however at present there is no deal of significant size at the horizon
3273002 in the medium term an extraordinary operation cannot be ruled out but it would be of small dimensions
3273003 for the current six month period at the ebitda level we should be in line with analysts consensus forecast

3273013 opinions are divided over how china will do in individual events but it seems almost everyone expects at least 40 golds which is very optimistic
3273014 michael page is really a jewel in the professional businessand the management is also very great
3273015 i cant say how much we are willing to spend we havealways said we can leverage our balance sheet to 1 billion eurosand we have roughly 400 million in shares available whatever wedo we will remain financially disciplined
3273016 we remain cautiously optimistic that the year as a wholewill be broadly in line with current expectations however ifthere are further heavy falls in the uk stock market orsignificant reductions in the level of interest rates we couldsee a deterioration in overall revenues
3273017 its a good way to take out frustrations but youre not doing it in a hurtful way
3273018 we started playing and it was the coolest thing id done in a long time
3273019 you have to be good at peripherals quickness your arm jumping
3273020 these people are family its like i have 60 or 70 friends i didnt have before
3273021 were trying to frame it and formalize it a little bit just to avoid conflict
3273022 i did feel for a long period that there wasnt anything new to buy
3273023 but i really like the slim fit its not so roomy not so bulky and its a lot cleaner
3273024 this is a trend that you have to buy otherwise you look outdated
3273025 suddenly a pair of cargo pants and a polo shirt doesnt look good anymore
3273026 womens wear has painted themselves in a corner by offering too many options and with everything a trend it is very easy not to buy anything
3273027 i had looked in the mirror and never was impressed i looked like a little kid who was waiting to grow into his clothes
3273028 i feel extremely confident in the way i look everyone has noticed
3273029 following recent media reports of significant civilian casualties isaf has now concluded a thorough investigation of the claim and has evidence that those killed were insurgents
3273030 still under observation they then moved to an open field where they were attacked and killed by shots from an isaf aircraft
3273031 the u s team gained a lot of momentum it was probably the most amazing race ive ever seen
3273032 it got a lot of us really really pumped up
3273033 it started like that at the world championships last year one swim started it all off and the great swims started to happen one after the other
3273034 it never gets old it really does feel like the first time its an absolutely beautiful feeling
3273035 i dont know if its shoulder strength or what but the amount of water hes able to hold is unbelievable and obviously hes got the right mind for it
3273036 hes always up to race and he always performs when it matters i think altogether that makes him a great performer better than the rest of the world obviously
3273037 it doesnt get any easier to be honest but certainly the experience and the knowledge that youve done it before helps knowing hopefully that you can probably do it again i really wanted to race today
3273038 i train to pretty much win on my worst day and thats the kind of mentality i use honestly i dont know what goes on in these others guys heads i know what i have to do to get my hand on the wall and to do what i have to do
3273039 if i progress in my events i only have 12 races in nine days the way i look at it is ive had lots and lots of practice
3273040 i didnt feel great going into this meet i had very very strong training but for whatever reason the last few days before the meet i wasnt feeling as strong
3273041 but i was able to get my head together and swim well today a lot of it was in my head
3273042 the 100 back has been progressing faster than any other female event and for me to win gold in such a strong strong event im so proud
3273043 which was probably why i was crying like a little baby on the awards stand i was really overwhelmed with emotion
3273044 i wasnt really ready to swim this until a couple of days ago so first of all to be in the event was a great feeling
3273045 it kind of felt like there was less pressure because it wasnt initially my event i felt whatever happened happened i kind of had fun with it and that helped a lot
3273046 at trials i was a little bit worried about it now i can just go for it and have fun
3273047 my thoughts go out to tara and also to jessica i dont think its necessarily fair what happened but rules are rules and im doing what im told
3273048 i wish tara could have been here i wish jessica could have been here
3273049 the officer has been removed to the hospital for treatment
3273050 we have not enforced the curfew restrictions around the jamia mosque in the old city area to allow the mourners attendance in the burial
3273051 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3273052 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3273053 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3273054 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3273055 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3273056 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3273057 we have brought in the family ticket after consultation with supporters
3273058 we are sure it will prove successful and is just another way in which are aiming to get as many families as possible to enjoy a day out at morecambe football club watching live football in a safe and enjoyable environment
3273059 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3273060 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3273061 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3273062 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3273063 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3273064 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3273065 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3273066 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3273067 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3273068 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3273069 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3273070 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3273071 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3273072 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3273073 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3273074 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3273075 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3273076 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3273077 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3273078 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3273079 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3273080 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3273081 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3273082 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3273083 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3273084 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3273085 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3273086 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3273087 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3273088 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3273089 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3273090 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3273091 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3273092 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3273093 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3273094 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3273095 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3273096 dont mistake a drunken credit binge of epic proportions for strong economic fundamentals if you do in a couple of years you will look as foolish as bernanake does now
3273097 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3273098 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3273099 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3273100 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3273101 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3273102 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3273103 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3273104 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3273105 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3273106 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3273107 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

3273110 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

3273113 this clubs been close to it a few times but weve bounced back and hopefully bournemouth will
3273114 we were 15 minutes away it going into administration was in at 12 oclock and at quarter to 12 the chairman called us to say everything was okay
3273115 i know bournemouth manager kevin bond well i used to live round the corner from him played many games of golf with him and hes got a tough task on his hands
3273116 more importantly for us weve got to go there and get the result that everybody believes we should do
3273117 but its not going to be easy its going to be hard and weve got to work our socks off as much as we did on saturday to get the result
3273118 everyone who signs a pro contract at this football club should be good enough to play in our first team
3273119 whatever side i pick i expect them to perform to the rest of their abilities
3273120 a little bit of shock and probably more relief i guess
3273121 it has been a long journey its been a long eight years
3273122 and i think just a lot of relief that the training was definitely worth it i couldnt care less about the time
3273123 an olympic gold is an olympic gold it really didnt matter how it went how i raced i couldnt care less
3273124 i woke up and i was just so excited i think i was excited about racing
3273125 i was almost skipping out there i was so excited i really enjoyed it
3273126 i think ive enjoyed it so much i think i would hate to finish and know there was still a flame burning inside
3273127 i think ive still got so much more growing to do and so much more learning
3273128 amanda beards on her fourth olympics so its certainly not out of the question
3273129 olympic golds are important but in terms of personal experience and in terms of personal growth i think that was my most important swim
3273130 olympic gold is really nice its what we all come here for
3273131 and i think that will still reign over this olympic gold because i found out so much of myself
3273132 after athens i learned so much and that was my first individual world championship gold
3273133 i think that one probably still is more important to me than this
3273134 i certainly wasnt composed once i got through the media and i pretty much lost it when i saw rohan and then when i saw my mum i just lost it
3273135 its hard at the time to deal with criticism and i copped a lot of it in athens
3273136 its really difficult but its made me a much stronger person and has made this performance much sweeter
3273137 they are likely to use any bomb they build both because of ideology and because of fear of israeli nuclear pre emption thus an israeli nuclear strike to prevent the iranians from taking the final steps toward getting the bomb is probable the alternative is letting tehran have its bomb in either case a middle eastern nuclear holocaust would be in the cards
3273138 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3273139 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3273140 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3273141 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3273142 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3273143 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3273144 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3273145 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

3273148 his attack upon the bedrock assumptions behind liberal philosophy is even more pointed the coolly rational preference calculator that is the foundation unit of liberal economic political and social activity is dismissed as a chimera on the basis of evidence from a most unexpected quarter
3273149 part of a wider concern on the authors part to put reason back in its box to establish a legitimate ground for emotion and intuition as components within an authentic moral self
3273150 what flourished was the political power of capital and the culture of consumption forces that have turned it into a sort of market totalitarianism
3273151 act according to goals and principles that we have given ourselves
3273152 that is the choice that is the arsenal of candidates seeking to succeed olmert none speak in the name of any ideology whatsoever a past prime minister who failed at his post and brought about the second intifada barak a former chief of staff and defence minister a cruel military man who fanned the flames and knows only how to sow destruction and death mofaz a mild mannered foreign minister who has not advanced peace in any way livni and netanyahu the person everyone loves to hate no worse than his fellow candidates but immeasurably more persecuted the media embraces livni accepts mofaz as legitimate sometimes supports barak but is terrified only by netanyahu why
3273153 what was essential and therefore justified in the pre state days is now assuming an ugly and violent form of colonial occupation the authoritarian regime in the territories the creation of two legal systems the placing of the army and police at the service of the settlement movement the robbing of palestinian lands
3273154 if society does not find the emotional strength to remove the noose of the settlements nothing but a sad memory will remain of the jewish state as it still exists
3273155 mired in delays a shortage of resources and differences between israelis and the americans over what military capabilities those forces should have once deployed in the territories
3273156 perhaps most worrying of all is that as palestinians lose hope in the peace process and look despairingly at both the fatah and hamas leaderships there is a danger of extremist al qaeda style alternatives emerging such activity may already be taking place today as politics breaks down into clan structures and groups like the army of islam appear hamas is not al qaeda but the alternative to it might be

3273177 its certainly hard not to be spooked by the currency chief executive chris roberts said during a teleconference
3273178 its really hard to give guidance its better off not giving any guidance were trying to manage this business over the longer term
3273179 the result was on the back of record sales of the cochlear implant units improved margins and a disciplined approach to expenses
3273180 in mexico a very very important cochlear implant surgeon was killed in a plane crash and that impacted that program in mexico for example
3273181 it is a shocking number but i still dont think it is the full cost

3273282 i have to forget about the bronze medal and concentrate on the 200m and once ive finished that then i can sit back and celebrate what ive achieved
3273283 my coach has told me to keep focused although its not easy i get quite emotional when i remember im an olympic medalist and i dont think its sunk in yet
3273284 i didnt really look at the flag when it started going up then i saw it and started to cry
3273285 to see two british flags and hear our national anthem was amazing i was just so happy to be on the podium with my best mate
3273286 i love jo to bits shes not just another british girl were great friends and really close
3273287 to be there with her and then have all the team singing the national anthem out of tune that just really made me laugh
3273288 its taken far too long for a british woman to win a swimming medal and hopefully this is the first of many to come
3273289 i think in years gone by we havent been using good enough facilities and weve been in a bit of a comfort zone
3273290 british swimming has taken a lot of criticism for shaking things up but a lot of respect must go to them for what they have done
3273291 insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result
3273292 conservatives are not necessarily stupid but most stupid people are conservatives

3273295 when was the last time you were on a bike
3273296 but the rule of thumb is once youve ridden one youll always know how
3273297 i really appreciate the helpful advice for raising daughters but we really need something to help our sons deal with aggressive girls in this sexually saturated culture
3273298 i have a very outgoing charming attractive 15 year old son i have literally been chasing the girls away from the door ever since the seventh grade the phone calls identified by caller id were left for the answering machine to answer the aggressiveness and promiscuity of young girls nowadays is beyond words their dress is so alluring and inviting to a young man whats a guy to do moreover whats a mom to do
3273299 how can we prepare our teenage sons for dealing with the attention and temptation being thrown at them by some sexually aggressive girls
3273300 in this case it was not the police that were setting mr read up to entice mr read to come over here to have sex with what he thought was a 15 and a 17 year old girl
3273301 in my experience ive never encountered this where an estranged wife has been the one that set up the sting
3273302 he acknowledged that he came over based on the text messages that were sent to him to have sex with a 15 and 17 year old girl
3273303 how i can skew my answer to be perceived more favorable be like someone else or be what someone else would want
3273304 but im good at this im not sure how else id make a living
3273305 people tell me i do this so well hasnt god gifted me to do this
3273306 god does not raise our income so that we can increase our standard of living but rather our standard of giving
3273307 this piece cost a lot of money i mean look at it its huge innit
3273308 its only a coast away its not like i went overseas

3273314 oh yeah i remember when i used to be a teenager a kid whatever went to chicago a lot went to a lot of parties
3273315 yeah but you know you grow up at some point youll stop going home as often you wont speak to whoever youre going to see and eventually you wont even think of chicago as home itll just be the next business meeting or family reunion you wont even want to be around your old friends theyll be too reckless for you youll be to old you know what i mean
3273316 well youll know what im talking about eventually age and displacement will catch up to anyone if you leave them to themselves for long enough time whats your name anyway
3273317 fucked up enough i think i did too many things tonight i feel weird
3273318 i know but you didnt have to you couldve left me
3273319 znamo da postoje prijetnje nekim svjedocima u ovom predmetu a neki od njih su zbog toga svjedo ili uz poduzimanje mjera za tite

3273326 i was really curious to know if it hurt testing my pain threshold was one reason
3273327 it hurt but not as much as i expected the lady i went to was a pro and went about it quite clinically the reason i tried it again was primarily because the first time was so easy it made me feel sexier for some reason i definitely plan to do it again

3273332 our goal ought to be a spirituality connected to this world in every aspect seeing he divine light through the mundane the physical the material the entire cosmos and not only in the churchy the correct and the pure which keeps the world split and contentious jesus is the icon of what salvation means when the two can happily coexist within us one might say that we are saved

3273334 each knife will be used on a candidate once if it is to be re used on another person it first has to be sterilised we have also discouraged the traditional practice of forcing the circumcised males into sexual intercourse to prove their manhood after the wound heals to avoid the spread of sexually transmitted diseases

3273343 believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man amp his god that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only and not opinions i contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole american people which declared that their legislature should
3273344 the phrase separation of church and state never appears in the constitution
3273345 no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship place or ministry whatsoever nor shall be enforced restrained molested or burthened in his body or goods nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief but that all men shall be free to profess and by argument to maintain their opinion in matters of religion and that the same shall in no wise diminish enlarge or affect their civil capacities
3273346 we have a philosophy that weve always had of throwing it out there and competing i know offensive coordinator cam cameron feels that way and rex feels that way
3273347 we all have the same personality and the same mind set that way
3273348 i am one sir that comes to tell you your daughter and the moor are now making the beast with two backs
3273349 in the vigour of his age he married gargamelle daughter to the king of the parpaillons a jolly pug and well mouthed wench these two did oftentimes do the two backed beast together joyfully rubbing and frotting their bacon gainst one another
3273350 he loves to compete and he is having a lot of fun this year
3273351 its not fun when you dont know what youre doing
3273352 he knew the defenses because he studied his butt off but he didnt know the pass routes obviously he was behind because it was all new to him you expect that to happen it took two years for a d to learn those things
3273353 last year at this time i was just trying to get comfortable
3273354 i was starting for the first time replacing a d this year is different i want to produce but i also want to make plays
3273355 when we need a play i want to be one of those people they look to to make plays when you play on a defense like ours with a ed reed there are certain expectations and you have to play up to those expectations
3273356 we have a great front seven and our defensive line dominates
3273357 without them our linebacking corps wouldnt be as good they allow us to be patient sit back and make good reads overall if we stay healthy i think rex wants us to be more aggressive than a year ago
3273358 we have this unwritten rule on defense that if you see someone throw a punch at one of us were going to pin our ears back and come at you
3273359 todd has a lot of guts and he is a lot scrappier than a lot of people think i felt bad for him messing with haloti but thats our style we always want to be aggressive
3273360 the difficult part is getting him to reach his potential
3273361 leron can be one of the top five fullbacks in the nfl if he applies himself to his job and to the team
3273362 i really want to be called just a back because i can do a lot more than just blocking
3273363 if i can get him on the first play then hes going to be in for a long game
3273364 i felt bad because i should have come to camp in shape
3273365 its day to day right now ive just been getting treatment on it its a little bit more in depth than youve been hearing about i cant really explain it at this point because im still researching it myself but i figure it might be all right
3273366 no im not doubtful of reeds availability for the season opener at all based on what weve been told by the doctors
3273367 i understand as an athlete you want it to be right
3273368 we were confident without the scope that he would have been ready
3273369 we just feel like this is a cautionary procedure and we want to make sure were right
3273370 i used to do it in high school and mess around with it in college just to keep that skill there in case there ever was an emergency

3273387 it is unlikely that aggression against our nato allies will occur with aircraft and tanks and troops
3273388 a nation could achieve the same and worse effects simply by turning off the taps people freeze industry stops

3273390 people think its too flattering to me that alexei miller was kind of stalking me when i was in the region
3273391 given the characteristics of russian diplomacy which have been not only competitive but sometimes gripping people by the throat they are likely to feel irritated that someone else is in the field

3273396 it seems the eyes could be a window to look at the condition of small vessels throughout the body including the heart said lead researcher dr jie jin wang from the centre for vision research at the university of sydney
3273397 its an opportunity to see damage that might be happening on the inside and help prevent it
3273398 that is a lot of people who may have early clues of a possible heart problem in their eyes
3273399 and people that are found to have retinopathy should be kept on watch for further heart check ups in the future dr wang said
3273400 they are really happy with him and almost proud to have him because it was quite a strange move to come from being england manager to twente but holland is very proud especially twente and they are all saying they really like his style of coaching

3273403 the cash we get given to police our various areas across the country thats provided by government thats provided by people through council tax and the provision of that is to provide a policing service to those areas and to those communities
3273404 if we have to take officers away from them to police football we are not able to recover the cost of that that means our normal police budget is being used for that purpose which means we then have to provide a lesser service to the rest of the community

3273408 people used to constantly complain about windows mobiles lack of ability to work as a reliable alarm clock but that has now been fixed for the most part i find the iphone to be practically worthless at ever waking me up and keep going back to a reliable and loud nokia s60 device to serve as a trustworthy alarm basic functions like this used to be required for a device but we seem to let these issues slide today
3273409 i get asked about beyonce all the time but i try and make fun of it
3273410 sometimes i say shes not my sister other times i say ive stuffed her in my suitcase and sent it to dubai

3273416 this tree was just growing taller and stronger above the rest of mother nature around it ours is going to bear some wonderful fruit
3273417 im planning to have lesbian kisses with britney and madonna individually its not going to be easy with my genitals but god i will try
3273418 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humour would come from
3273419 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3273420 joss is a big supporter of barack obama and was very excited to be asked to do this for him
3273421 he sent a personal message asking her to get on board
3273422 she believes he is going to be the first black american president and she is honoured to be a part of that
3273423 were both fine and shias fine as well his hand is healing well
3273424 but everyone started staring once she said she had reserved a seat and told the ticket taker her name so he began spelling out her name and yelling to the driver m for mary o for octopus r for robert moore moore she handled it so cool
3273425 hugh couldnt stop grinning he looked genuinely excited to see the baby and his kids looked excited too
3273426 not protect any person or entity through false information or omission
3273427 i think its an obscenity i cannot imagine that people in that situation who did what they did to their own daughter are attempting to profit from it
3273428 despite their the parents egregious denial of her danieals existence in life they now seek to profit by her tragic death that they caused
3273429 the potential beneficiaries are the brothers and sisters and the parents but the parents may be disqualified by a conviction or a civil finding of abandonment
3273430 the beneficiaries could be these kids danieals siblings and that could be a positive outcome
3273431 reimbursement for medical bills funeral and interment expenses and administrative expenses
3273432 he viewed her dead body before she was removed by the medical examiners office
3273433 it frightens me that too many of the children that we serve are trapped in some schools and classrooms that appear to be wastelands for human potential rather than fertile ground for the development of our most precious resources
3273434 it makes me sick that far too many of our children come to our public schools and are locked into school environments where some adults and you know this is true have decided that they have little or no chance to succeed
3273435 then we blame the victims the children theres something wrong with that
3273436 i dont think we have the answers to determine why this has happened we are going to focus on changing those outcomes
3273437 then review with your staff what you will do differently to address the needs of your entire student population
3273438 i am asking that you begin this new school year with the vow to give to other peoples children what you would want for your own to go the extra mile to hold yourself and your staffs accountable for student successes and student failures
3273439 dr ackerman echoed the sentiments of every principal in that room
3273440 we all see the problem we all try to address the problem the sense of urgency is there its been there
3273441 we have to increase the importance in their minds that education is cool
3273442 education is your way to success not throwing a basketball not throwing a football because the likelihood of them going to the nba or nfl is slim to none reality is to look at education as a way of life not as something that you have to do
3273443 i think were going to move this school district under dr ackermans leadership
3273444 were going to have to work harder work smarter and come up with a game plan
3273445 lets not let the truth get in the way of a good argument
3273446 it is standard operating procedure for a judge to order no contact with any witnesses and that can include the family
3273447 because normally the written order controls a careful attorney will make sure its on the record
3273448 one has to assume the true motivation behind this action is to build campaign support for the next gubernatorial election and divert attention away from his own personal issues that may stand in the way of his ambitions
3273449 magistrate renee mcduffee ordered that the conditions of the bond included having no contact with the witnesses of this case the court was clear that this prohibition extended to the witnesses not merely the two victims
3273450 ich hoffe das parlament wird den ruf von f nf millionen menschen nicht ignorieren
3273451 anybody who wants to beat me up for this they should have at it
3273452 the truth is you cant possibly beat me up more than ive already beaten myself up
3273453 i was taken in by his magnificent rhetoric and now i think hes treacherous
3273454 its an insult greater than i could ever imagine that he would do this to that magnificent family he has
3273455 he was trying to relieve himself of the horror of what he had done almost saying had i known that she was in the last stages of her life i would never have done it
3273456 what that demonstrates is that he had no love for his wife because you dont do that to someone you love he has soiled her
3273457 i dont think that candidates private lives are particularly relevant to how theyll perform in office
3273458 if we rated our presidents by the quality of their private lives youd have to say that nixon and bush are two of the best presidents we ever had
3273459 john edwards knows what the rules are he knew at the time he ran for president that he was having an affair and he should have known that was going to come out it was reckless for him to run for president under those terms i feel very disappointed in him his campaign the judgment he showed
3273460 it would have been better if hed issued an apology and just gone away
3273461 tarnishes the moral credibility hes built through his work on poverty and it also raises questions about his overall judgment
3273462 my own people used to say to me you speak like a white woman what does that even mean anyway everyone has their way of speaking and living their life
3273463 no one should be judging and assuming that because im black i have to speak in that hip hop way thats something i prefer not to do
3273464 pervez has insulted and compromised pakistans sovereignty by allowing the cia and fbi to operate freely in pakistan and arrest interrogate torture deport and detain any person whether pakistani or not for as long as they like thus turning the pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade
3273465 all government is evil and trying to improve it is largely a waste of time
3273466 we believe any decision at this time on whether he should remain majority leader is premature and wrong
3273467 this analysis was not undermined in any way by politicians
3273468 we just feel bad about this whole situation i wish it could have ended differently
3273469 until our cities can come together to put the guns down and pick up purpose and love we will see this again
3273470 everything senator mccain has done has been to widen that gap between the richest and most powerful corporations and small businesses
3273471 working families are looking for a leader who will get our economy moving again and obamas continued clinging to the failed tax and spend policies of the past will do exactly the opposite
3273472 to call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking get him down there and get him to work
3273473 theres no question the selection of tom ridge as john mccains running mate would make our job harder here
3273474 even with tom ridge on the ticket i believe sen obama could and would carry the state
3273475 it has to be conscious you have to know what youre doing
3273476 when police officers arrived they observed a male in the house through a window and they asked him to open the door and he refused
3273477 officers heard him on the phone saying its time for me to die and im going to die now
3273478 he did not have permission to be in the house and he did make forced entry so he will be charged
3273479 i think the whole thing stinks my back door is completely busted out
3273480 never has there been an audience as friendly as this one
3273481 we have people come to this in costume and they look better than we do one guy came out in full armor a mom brought her two sons dressed as king arthur and patsy we can hear them saying the lines with us
3273482 listen to it sort through it contemplate it but dont take it
3273483 when they were both about to leave they had a heated argument outside the restaurant they were doing a good amount of yelling
3273484 i probably threw away more music than is on the album now
3273485 but the album is a product of all the stuff i threw away it was important to the album
3273486 there was a song about a donkey that got eradicated
3273487 its no different to what i normally do really it just costs a bit more but i cant delegate anything im a control freak but in a nice way
3273488 maybe when im 40 and broke i might come back but that all feels a bit pants
3273489 it was a lot i cant count but it was cool i guess

3273608 in addition we will simultaneously debut fog mountain featuring the first organically farmed california nouveau in 750ml pet bottles to highlight our commitment to reducing the wine worlds carbon footprint by producing locally
3273609 it is critical in todays time with the scarcity of our planets resources and the known environmental impacts of human activity that we consider whether we should still ship thousands of cases of wine in heavy bottles via air throughout the world in order for the wines to arrive on time for their annual release date in november when we can reduce fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions by more than half through a responsible choice of packaging
3273610 were all of this years beaujolais nouveau imported to north america similarly packaged in pet or other alternative packages we estimate saving literally millions of pounds of greenhouse gas emissions from entering our atmosphere
3273611 our beaujolais nouveau wines in pet bottles weigh a mere 22 lbs per case vs 38 pounds for the traditional bottle a 42 savings in shipping weight
3273612 this directly translates into fuel savings and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions
3273613 we expect that freight costs will be approximately 33 lower for beaujolais nouveau wines in pet this savings will be directly passed on to the consumer
3273614 the traditional characteristics of beaujolais nouveau wines crisp refreshing young fruit are perfectly protected in our innovative pet bottle further the shatterproof bottle finished with a screwcap provides ease of use safety and convenience to all who enjoy the first taste of the 2008 harvest

3273632 it is encouraging that the growth in health care costs is going down but there is still more work to be done
3273633 when costs go up as great as this theres a lot of market pressure brought to bear on all of the parts of the market to bring those costs down and i think thats whats been happening over the last six years or so

3273635 domestic institutions reported having tightened their lending standards and terms on all major loan categories over the previous three months
3273636 it reinforces the view that the economy will be weak in the next several months and there will be renewed pressure on the fed to start easing again
3273637 when the fed started to cut rates mortgage rates and other rates were actually lower than they are today
3273638 to say that things are easier in many areas of credit would be mistaken
3273639 when times are tough the herd starts running in the other direction with tougher standards pretty much across the board
3273640 large majorities of domestic respondents reported having tightened their lending standards on prime nontraditional and subprime residential mortgages over the previous three months
3273641 very large majorities of domestic and foreign respondents pointed to a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook their banks reduced tolerance for risk and the worsening of industry specific problems as reasons for tightening their lending standards
3273642 about 60 percent of domestic banks a slightly larger fraction than in the april survey reported having tightened lending standards on commercial and industrial loans to large and middle market firms over the past three months
3273643 there is absolutely no way that they could do that

3273663 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3273664 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad

3273670 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
3273671 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
3273672 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3273673 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3273674 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3273675 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3273676 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3273677 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3273678 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3273679 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3273680 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3273681 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3273682 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3273683 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos

3273707 i think im in love and not just with my wife
3273708 hermiston is obviously a progressive community focused on growth and quality of life for all of its residents and i want to contribute to these positive goals
3273709 ill hit my momma ill hit whoever it doesnt make a difference
3273710 youve got equipment on and you step on the field in between the lines and its hey you ready to get hit its full tilt it doesnt make a difference theyre going to hit me so why not me hit them
3273711 my first year my head was spinning my second year my head was spinning my third year my head is still spinning
3273712 it doesnt stop its always something new that you have to learn around here thats the good thing about being here you learn a lot youve got great coaches and great players around you and you can always learn from them
3273713 football is fun its always been fun to me i love football
3273714 i always have loved football there is nothing else in this world that i will ever do besides play football where else do you get to hit people and you dont go to jail for it or nothing like that i mean id hit your mother if she had equipment on
3273715 every day you have to come out here and you have to work hard because anything can happen
3273716 just like last year and buffalo bills tight end kevin everett and some of the nfl guys who got killed last year this is always an opportunity god has given us the ability to be out here and play football and use your talents and everything so why not take full advantage of that
3273717 by us being out here and walking over to them that put a smile on their face and made them happy anytime you see that it makes you feel happy it makes you feel good inside your heart starts to melt
3273718 salvo unas figuras que no es casual que se est n dando en catalu a
3273719 just being able to run around on the field and not have any concerns about kind of limping or gimping or something like that
3273720 it was just fun to run around and feel young
3273721 he is way ahead of where he was last year with being able to participate in training camp
3273722 he has done well and it is good to have him out here
3273723 obviously we know we have a talented front hopefully we can get some pressure on the quarterback but were a team you cant have any weak links just because the front gets pressure you still have to have guys back there who can cover
3273724 everyone has to pull their own weight and take care of their own responsibilities or the coaching staff and management will have to get someone in there that can get the job done those guys look good but its still early at this point now and i look forward to good things from the secondary
3273725 i feel i have a lot of work to do
3273726 my heart was pounding pretty hard the first couple of plays but after watching the film i left a lot of plays out there that im trying to get better for this week
3273727 maybe during a regular season game but right now im just trying to focus on the little things and technique issues that i have and try to get better each and every day
3273728 ive hit rodney coming through the hole in pass protection and ive had to block tedy bruschi and those guys and have some pretty big hits so in my mind thats it
3273729 we can all do different things and we are each others biggest cheerleaders when were on the sidelines
3273730 it is unfortunate tank worked hard and did a great job for us
3273731 unfortunately he is going to be out we have to move on he has come back well from this type of injury before so i am sure he will work hard to come back from this one

3273737 the outlook revision reflects our expectation that the current economic environment characterized by upward pressure on energy and food prices and an appreciating currency that is pegged to the euro will further weaken burkina fasos already minimal external and fiscal flexibility
3273738 the general government deficit excluding grants is estimated at 12 of gdp in 2008 and at about 13 of gdp in 2007
3273739 the ratings on lebanon were raised to reflect the easing of tensions between the march 14th coalition which dominated the government and the opposition that in may had taken lebanon to the brink of civil conflict
3273740 the doha accord which has delivered the election of a president and the formation of a national unity cabinet augurs well for lebanons immediate political stability
3273741 this reduces the risk that depositors will withdraw funds from the lebanese banking sector which in turn lessens the governments near term financing risks as banks are by far the governments largest creditors
3273742 since the private placement note is already in default there is high risk they will default on the global bond
3273743 it is not yet time for monetary policy to focus only on slowing economic growth because the inflation risk remains in place
3273744 i am optimistic and we have upped our end year forecast because of a very good harvest
3273745 the whole cee central european region is starting to print weaker growth and worse trade numbers given easing external demand and surging commodity prices
3273746 moodys expects there will be difficult days ahead for ukraine given its heightened external financing needs in the context of global market volatility
3273747 still a positive outlook was judged to be appropriate because ukraine has accumulated a large foreign reserve cushion after many years of strong economic growth and earlier current account surpluses
3273748 the violence between georgian troops and armed separatists in the breakaway region of south ossetia over the past seven days has escalated to the brink of war with russia upon whom the separatists depend for political and economic support

3273819 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3273820 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3273821 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3273822 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3273823 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3273824 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3273825 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3273826 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3273827 i think i need to show them that i can run the offense consistently and make plays what they are looking for is a leader someone to take charge
3273828 osaar is trying to come to terms with a new offense
3273829 the one he executed last year was tailor made for him now its a new deal
3273830 he has a tendency to want to get out of there
3273831 i have to show them that i know what im doing out there and show them i can be a leader and run this team thats what theyre looking for someone who knows the playbook inside and out and can show the other guys to help them and have them trust you
3273832 chris i think has to grasp the whole package more
3273833 i think he can execute plays i dont think he knows how it all fits together
3273834 a little baby goes to talk or wants to eat they rush because their brain is going before they can think things through
3273835 i have to come out here and be consistent with the checks and consistent with the throws every day until sept 1 i have to keep progressing and try not to take steps back
3273836 first im consoling an owner then i have to take a bloody bag and open it not knowing what condition the animal is in
3273837 we feel for these workers but we cant promise the money until it comes in
3273838 but we dont know how much money were going to take in in this strategy
3273839 the underlying pressures are so large they have to release the pressure from time to time
3273840 im not as disciplined about it as i once was but i hope to find my way back as i get older and a little less selfish
3273841 if i start going back to church id have to stop the smoking and drinking and i wouldnt be able to curse any more im ashamed to say that ive got very lazy about it all

3273847 when they tried to make their way back down the way they had gone up they found their way blocked by a river that was so badly swollen they could not get across
3273848 in the darkness and bad weather they rang for assistance

3273867 its equal men and women particularly fathers of daughters men of color are for me and of course women i wish we could end the gender and race card
3273868 pressure is a privilege lessons ive learned from life and the battle of the sexes
3273869 bobby riggs was as old as billie jean kings father it was no great athletic achievement it showed that women can handle pressure and that everyone can be treated with respect
3273870 it made women think if she can do that i can it gave women the courage to ask for a raise and to tell their husbands to get their own coffee it made women feel valued
3273871 without title ix little girls would not have grown up to play in front of packed houses at uconn basketball games without it the sports lessons of self esteem camaraderie and discipline would not have reached an entire generation of women

3273886 he knew that if he hit tskhinvali south ossetias capital the russians would hit georgia now they are bombing us into oblivion
3273887 we need to know whether we are still under moscows rule or whether we are protected by the west
3273888 were not sure anymore whether the west defends us russia feels like it can do whatever it wants we dont feel safe anymore
3273889 russia makes clear what the goal of this operation is
3273890 the goal of this operation is not only to annex part of georgian territory but the goal of this operation is the regime change in georgia the change of democratically elected government in georgia
3273891 my son drives an ambulance and every day he takes the dead and wounded to the local hospital
3273892 if he had really done something we wouldnt have so many dead and wounded we worry that gori will be destroyed just like tskhinvali was
3273893 we are working very hard with the europeans to try to resolve the conflict
3273894 the russians have said that the one thing they want is for the u s and the europeans not to do things such as bring georgia and ukraine into nato does that suggest options i dont know

3273969 the industry is creating fresh capacities at an aggressive pace and as these new capacities get commissioned supplies would increase to meet the soaring demand as a result we believe that the current slowdown seen in the iip numbers is a short term phenomenon that would be reversed by the middle of 2008 09

3274000 preferite che gli altri siano attratti dalla vostra personalit piuttosto che dal vostro aspetto questo non significa che non dobbiate mantenervi in forma ma che volete si sappia soprattutto che siete intelligenti
3274001 felice del binomio spirito e corpo vivi con le giuste percezioni e con la consapevolezza di chi non ha nulla da invidiare a nessuno ecco perch appari sempre sicuro di te e delle tue azioni estroverso e spregiudicato sempre allaltezza dosato
3274002 hai un carattere molto timido e introverso non aleggia in te nemmeno un briciolo di spudoratezza sei talmente distante da questo atteggiamento che ti sfugge persino il significato fai della riservatezza una ragione di vita non ti sbilanci mai e hai la rara capacit di mantenere sempre il controllo anche quando tutto e tutti ti sono avversi chi ti conosce davvero non ha dubbi in proposito
3274003 riesci a far buon uso del linguaggio sei sicuro di te stesso e non parli mai a vanvera non fai del linguaggio una ragione di vita ma quando occorre sai spiegarti perfettamente hai la capacit di trovare le parole giuste quando la situazione lo richiede senza per questo scadere nella retorica un buon uso della dialettica condito dalla condizione di saper ascoltare moderato
3274004 hai lambizione di crescere professionalmente del resto perch non dovrebbe essere cos ci non significa necessariamente che sei disposto a sacrificare ogni istante della tua esistenza per il lavoro hai linnata capacit di saperti adattare alle circostanze non esiti a sacrificarti per raggiungere ottimi risultati ma il tuo tempo libero e i tuoi interessi sono sacri composto
3274005 hai un rapporto piuttosto concreto e stabile con il tuo denaro non ami sbilanciarti fare il cosiddetto passo pi lungo della gamba non nel tuo stile questo per non significa che tu non sappia toglierti certe soddisfazioni sei concreto e attento al risparmio ma anche disposto a sacrifici per coltivare i tuoi interessi la tua sembrerebbe la politica vincente il modo migliore per godersi la vita

3274009 non ho resistito alla tentazione e sono ripassata complimenti per il tuo blog mi piace moltissimo ho iniziato a leggere qualcosa e pi leggevo e pi avevo voglia di andare avanti proprio come un romanzo che ti appassiona
3274010 lo sai forse il motivo del tuo successo che scrivi tanto ogni giorno hai un blog super aggiornato scrivi cose che vivi sulla tua pelle cose semplici della vita quotidiana le scrivi dettagliate con trasporto ed emozione sei sincero parli ai lettori con voce umile sei diventato un posto di ritrovo continua a tenerci compagnia ancora

3274016 lamore e un incendio che ti sfugge dal controllo che non puoi pi domare che scoppia e non puoi spegnere e travolge tutto quello che trova intorno
3274017 ma aldil delle frasi fatte che una donna vuole sentirsi dire correggetemi se sbaglio penso che non c bisogno di essere degli studiosi per far felice una donna no basta solo lamore e una volta tanto basta solo far parlare il cuore e dire qualcosa di carino ricordandosi sempre che il cuore a parlare perch lamore in fondo solo un incontro di emozioni nate pure e vitali nel nostro profondo e siccome penso che le donne vadano adorate e corteggiate ogni giorno e che ogni giorno vadano premiate per tutto quello che le donne fanno per noi maschietti per rendere loro il nostro grazie basta solo far parlare il cuore e allora si che una donna sar felice

3274093 i think meshfree still has advantages 1 higher order continuity 2 mesh distortion insensitivity my key concern is the amount or lack of it of mathematical understanding i think this is clearly the thing that is slowing down the process for instance it would be great if we could use point collocation methods because these methods can lead to higher accuracy for the same computational cost compared to galerkin methods however for now we do not understand what is going on it is not entirely true that people are giving up as t belytschko still publishes on meshfree and the finite point method was recently introduced however many people believe that xfem will supersede meshfree methods simply because it is closer to fem i think that xfem pufem etc can clearly capture discontinuities just as well as meshfree but they still suffer for now from lack of continuity and accuracy near the singularities crack tips for instance and this is a general problem these methods being fem based are also sensitive to mesh distortion except if you consider some of the new methods such as the flexible xfem that we are publishing papers about at the moment and the smoothed fem

3274113 this was kind of like using the hand grenade on the horsefly if you throw the book at this guy then what do you do about there are plenty of guys down there that are really bad guys that need to have the book thrown at them but if you do a 30 year minimum sentence which was the prosecutions request and they would have preferred life where do you step up from that

3274134 smbs are considering cutting down on business travel to bring down costs especially in the wake of spiraling fuel prices other real time communication methods like audio and video conferencing can help them reduce the need of business travel and face to face meetings
3274135 there is a pull for the spanish integrators to get projects in by september but even beyond that most of these solar companies are seeing very very strong demand for 2009

3274141 we couldnt write to all 40 000 as it would have cost too much and we would have had staff stuffing envelopes for days
3274142 we knew people would talk to their neighbours and that more people would come to the exhibitions than those we wrote to

3274171 its a fantastic example of whats possible online it would be virtually impossible both in terms of cost and logistics to get this team together for any one business so we know this show is only going to continue to grow in popularity with viewers
3274172 acquiring full ownership will enable mufg and btmu to demonstrate an enhanced commitment to the u s market and allow greater management flexibility including for participation in the future consolidation of the u s banking market in addition it will take unbc to the next level and enable us to build an integrated corporate governance and unified risk management structure in the united states we will also be able to create broader opportunities for unbc executives and employees and enhanced services for unbc customers

3274187 the decision has been made after several discussions between rikki and myself he felt as though the role was impacting on his own personal performance and that was affecting the team
3274188 it is a brave decision by rikki and he deserves respect for putting the team and the club ahead of his own personal ambitions as a captain
3274189 he hasnt played as well as he would have liked since joining us he moved from the county he has spent his whole career during the winter and he and his partner harriet have had their first child this summer
3274190 that is an awful lot to be going on for any player and rikki felt it was best for everyone concerned if he gave up the captaincy

3274196 i was married before that altar and i plan to be back in a pew when we complete this job
3274197 but the church was fortunate in that the fire burned from above and not from the ground up the building is significantly damaged and the whole superstructure of the roof will have to come off
3274198 the disconcerting thing about this job is that people have been pulling up out front and just started crying
3274199 its such an emotional experience this building has figured in their lives
3274200 what struck me about the church was that its interior woodwork was so beautiful
3274201 it had such a well maintained feel and its interior had never been changed or jazzed up it was really a little gem
3274202 a handsome edifice of falls road granite and rough marble trimmings
3274203 its devastating to the environment no matter which way you look at it
3274204 im still trying to find someone but i dont think it will get any better in the foreseeable future
3274205 the process is very time consuming and i am already very busy as it is
3274206 this is the unfortunate reality of our health care system its an example of how the market triumphs over public policy
3274207 even if universal health care comes into play tomorrow not everyone would have access to a health care provider
3274208 for the future we need to retain at least 50 percent of residents trained inside of maryland and also make it more attractive for those who want to come from outside the state
3274209 i dont want to be strapped down with loans forever and i know that primary care pays on the lower end of the spectrum
3274210 the largest insurance companies in the state have not raised their reimbursement rates
3274211 ongoing expenses such as vaccines cost me more than what the insurance companies pay me
3274212 i love what i do and i get to take care of people on an extended basis
3274213 i develop a relationship with patients some through three four generations

3274216 jersey walls are not designed to handle a 55 mph 80 000 pound truck impact
3274217 its very unlikely this would happen with a passenger size vehicle
3274218 there was no way for the truck to do anything
3274219 the camaro was head on into the truck it jackknifed the brakes locked and made a screech
3274220 there is no doubt in my mind im 100 percent certain that this bridge is safe

3274222 bindra has shattered the grand narrative of failure that has characterised indian sport just as the emergence of the it industry in the 90s signified the end of the
3274223 i am quite impressed by the level and the extent of security that has been in place i think it is still another matter for us to be able to convey it to the full task team
3274224 that would be a challenge because we have personally come to do this visit and it will be upon us to convey that message and raise the confidence of the players that from what we have seen and experienced is the security measures that are in place should be sufficient to have an event that will be safe and secure

3274234 we often have three hours of procedural things to get through and thats assuming that there is good preparation we really dont get that time to discuss big picture issues
3274235 the review and evaluation of the school program and or the development and discussion of board policy
3274236 we want to clarify for people what is appropriate for public comment
3274237 we really want people to tell us what theyre thinking but to be focused
3274238 to report the results of their meetings and group activities
3274239 its our attempt to kind of streamline and use the time well
3274240 needs a variety of stakeholder and constituent groups to fairly represent public opinion
3274241 there are a number of issues that we in the past have challenged the board about that have caused the board to move
3274242 we are hoping that the people who want to comment will use the other ways of doing it as well as the board meetings
3274243 the only way that comments can be entered into the public record
3274244 it simply helps the board be more involved more informed
3274245 they are the governors of the school system to be a good governor you have to know the issues and work sessions are designed to help them do that
3274246 the rates are much higher in baltimore than other areas of the state
3274247 there are a lot of lives to be saved by reducing cardiovascular disease you can connect the dots from high salt intake to excessive death rates in cardiovascular disease
3274248 we got criticized years ago for encouraging people not to smoke and many people argued it was a choice
3274249 but we feel that sodium consumption and hypertension are very similar to smoking in that people need to be protected from things that can harm them
3274250 if every option you have has too much salt in it you dont have much of a choice
3274251 im not saying every restaurant has this problem but if there are not enough low salt options then what kind of choice is it
3274252 people used to be more worried about nuclear power because it was new
3274253 now its wind power that seems to be the new technology while nuclear power has become less new so some of the concerns over that have dissipated over time
3274254 the negative impact of wind power is very easy to see you can see directly what it is doing to your view while its benefits are more amorphous
3274255 it was a very hard fought series that drained a lot out of us
3274256 we showed a lot of character especially to come back after the galle test i am very happy with the players because they played really good cricket throughout the series we kept the standards high kept pushing ourselves and we never gave up
3274257 credit should go to the whole team i thought the difference was that we had a lot of contributions from different players throughout the series whenever we were in a situation that we needed somebody to put their hand up do something for us they did it thats probably the most pleasing thing for me
3274258 the credit should go to the bowling unit for keeping india to a highest innings total of 329 in the whole series our guys went really hard at them and kept the pressure going
3274259 ajantha was brilliant adding a different dimension to the bowling attack
3274260 he has fitted into the dressing room well and has been very humble in all his achievements which is great to see
3274261 in terms of the bowling obviously mendis was the difference picking up 26 wickets
3274262 with murali muttiah muralitharan and mendis together it is not easy to get runs off them and we kept losing wickets because of the pressure created by the two of them
3274263 the batsmen didnt put up a good show here and it probably cost us the series it was critical the middle order got runs and there was not enough consistency by the batters overall sri lanka bowled better and took their catches better they played better cricket throughout the series and they are deservedly the winners
3274264 i could not have asked any more from the boys
3274265 if we play like we played this week we can beat australia the key is to turn up like we did this week in every game
3274266 thats going to be a very interesting series one im really going to watch closely
3274267 hopefully we can keep everybody fit for australia and if we can round off the season with a win that would be great
3274268 but this one is the one that has meant most to us
3274269 we have waited a long time for this moment we came here with a goal in mind and that was to win the series and we are really chuffed to have done it
3274270 ive been seven days in the job now and ive enjoyed every single minute of it
3274271 its going to take some time to see his style and how things develop
3274272 if he bowls like he bowled in this game hes going to be a real asset
3274273 he was magnificent i asked him to be like the old steve harmison and he was im definitely going to get the best out of steve
3274274 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks

3274309 a little over a year ago i posted an article talking about hockey jesus contract extension granted my writing wasnt the best the blog had been open less than a week but the premise remains the same crosby and his sweater took a paycut in order for the penguins to sign some talent to hover around him so he can win a cup
3274310 crosby born 8 7 87 wearing number 87 signed for 8 7 million a year how quaint the problem here is that crosby who is now the youngest player ever to be made captain of his team restructured his deal to make almost 2 million less than he could have with the sole intent that the cap space would go to re sign his teammates coming up as unrestricted free agents soon and to bring in the missing piece or two to the teams hopeful cup run but who have the pens signed since crosby signed his contract last week they re signed colby anderson who is another young whippersnapper that pens fans feel is a vital cog in the machine
3274311 the lightning called to say thanks for half your team
3274312 pittsburgh has a great team great people great organization i had to compare the two teams and theres a little better chance to win the cup in detroit i had a great time with sid and playing on the power play with geno evgeni malkin but the team in detroit is something special i know its a short term but we never talked about a one year deal with pittsburgh we just talked about a long term deal i totally believe detroit has the kind of team that can win it again
3274313 lorsque la cour nationale lectorale me fera parvenir les r sultats officiels dans vingt trente jours alors nous convoquerons les gouverneurs et les syndicats civils et ruraux pour un dialogue
3274314 nous obliger nous rassembler pour un dialogue pour lunit de la bolivie et pour la justice sociale

3274318 i dont think my daughter knew what she was getting into
3274319 the babys father was in jail she was going through a long time
3274320 had a problem with baby javon who would not comply with mealtime ritual by saying amen after meals
3274321 the more the queen pressed javon the more resistant he became
3274322 the queen told everyone that god was going to raise javon from the dead
3274323 the queen was able to gain the confidence of morgan who allowed the group to stay at his residence approximately one week
3274324 we must do this because we cannot and will not tolerate innocent people especially children to be victims
3274325 this is aimed at helping young people in our city this is not an attempt to be punitive
3274326 the aclu of connecticut opposes juvenile curfews because theyre essentially a violation of fundamental rights of innocent people
3274327 curfews essentially are placing an entire demographic in this case youth under house arrest for the inappropriate actions of a few
3274328 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3274329 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3274330 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3274331 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3274332 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3274333 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3274334 just because we are not rushing to place u s infantry in tbilisi does not mean the world is impotent in the face of this aggression
3274335 the russians have plenty of money now and we need their oil more than they need our credits
3274336 i cant think of a single specialist batsman or bowler who played a large number of odi games and did extremely well who could not make it in test cricket
3274337 as long as applications were made and approved in advance
3274338 we chinese people love the olympics and support the olympics and thats why there are no protesters
3274339 you have no idea how we sat up at night
3274340 we are still hiring for this year with several jobs open in critical areas
3274341 we expect to have all positions filled but we wont have a surplus
3274342 what happened to me and my family and my close relations resulted from efforts to get rid of me from politics
3274343 these are my political enemies they dont care about the rule of law facts or internationally recognized due process
3274344 i receive information and hints about attempts to assassinate me all the time
3274345 i will return and die on thai soil just like other thais
3274346 were really talking about taking a look with a very different lens
3274347 as an example for tenants they talk about trying some things that are common sense first talk to the smoker maybe the smoker doesnt realize that its creating a problem for other people in the building
3274348 we know from the surgeon generals report in 2006 that secondhand smoke is a health hazard and theres no safe level of exposure
3274349 it was a tough transition for many but what we found was that many were willing to stop smoking or go for education classes working with the broome county health department to do those type of things
3274350 31 citoyens ukrainiens vacu s sont arriv s kiev ce sont majoritairement des femmes et des enfants

3274359 the americans were going to smash them thats what we came here for
3274360 i tried so hard not to notice i tried so hard not to care
3274361 i think i need to show them that i can run the offense consistently and make plays what they are looking for is a leader someone to take charge
3274362 osaar is trying to come to terms with a new offense
3274363 the one he executed last year was tailor made for him now its a new deal
3274364 he has a tendency to want to get out of there
3274365 i have to show them that i know what im doing out there and show them i can be a leader and run this team thats what theyre looking for someone who knows the playbook inside and out and can show the other guys to help them and have them trust you
3274366 chris i think has to grasp the whole package more
3274367 i think he can execute plays i dont think he knows how it all fits together
3274368 a little baby goes to talk or wants to eat they rush because their brain is going before they can think things through

3274382 btrc is striving relentlessly to introduce affordable new technology services that benefit the bangladeshi people btrc welcomes all initiatives that work towards unveiling new opportunities and building a modern and affordable ict portfolio for bangladeshi consumers btrc is happy to support ericsson in their demonstration of 3g hspa technology i believe there would be immense benefits for bangladeshi telecom subscribers by gaining high speed mobile internet access through 3g hspa technology in the near future
3274383 this pioneering project will showcase the full potential of broadband services for the first time in the country and how an efficient and affordable 3g hspa broadband service can help serve as a blueprint for the widespread introduction of internet connectivity
3274384 contrasts with a very low level of reserves replacement in recent years low investment in exploration signs of maturity in significant fields and production that is operating to the limit to cover every industry demand
3274385 these figures add up to substantial risk given argentinas heavy dependence on these fuels
3274386 in addition most of the exploration concessions expire between 2015 and 2017 this puts a big constraint on companies incentives to undertake risky investments that are capable of extending the lifespan of reserves when their contracts could expire in seven to nine years
3274387 serves to further strain other sectors at times of peak consumption
3274388 still local production in argentina isnt enough to cover the current demand growth rates
3274389 private companies are investing little in exploration as the risk of doing such work increases and the size of discoveries shrinks as a result argentina could become a net oil importer before 2010 oil can easily be imported but if the country were to lose its own supply it would have to swiftly close the gap between local and international prices
3274390 in this context the fuel market is seen as tight on the short term especially for diesel
3274391 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to us residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions
3274392 this occurred in the context of continuing credit market turbulence and its impact on the firms operating performance and reputation
3274393 absolutely ron george should be thrown out for voting for gay marriage
3274394 he has a very radical view of whats a family
3274395 i really felt that as chief justice i had to have the broad shoulders because i knew there would be substantial controversy about it
3274396 most people thought his legacy would be the modernization of the courts
3274397 i think the gay marriage decision will now be his principal legacy

3274400 its a way to lock up the content and its not enabling as much innovation as we would like to see
3274401 personally im mostly interested about the bigger issue of how we can make our mobile devices more intelligent and so they can sense something from the environment
3274402 but we are not yet at the level that we could integrate those things together into a device that were showing in this animation
3274403 im is too useful to completely restrict if you try to lock it down but dont provide any outlet for employees to stay in touch with the outside world users will find a way around your security policy
3274404 these applications can increasingly be the source of new viruses
3274405 the only question is whether youre going to be able to monitor and control it or not
3274406 and never install programs unless you know what they do whether they are comm programs or otherwise
3274407 this is what keeps many of us it and security professionals up at night
3274408 security applications take some overhead and may lower performance of the end station folks will turn them off as a result
3274409 sometimes you just have to postpone the old monolithic virus scan so you can get some work done
3274410 theres always a trade off make sure you make the right one
3274411 the vast majority of web pages contain one or more types of active content with an unmistakable trend toward increasing use of active content in web pages
3274412 there is plenty of active content spam out there and phishers use it too
3274413 when in doubt delete it without looking at it if its important real mail the sender will try again or maybe even pick up the phone
3274414 becoming a frequent source of infection via drive by downloads and zero day exploits
3274415 this is really a lot like mom and dad buying a great new security system for the house and junior leaving the combination under the doormat
3274416 passwords are high maintenance people forget them people lose them they have to be reset
3274417 you might trust the employee but you have to draw the line at friends and family
3274418 this is something that young employees bored security guards and interns are more likely to do
3274419 its an attractive nuisance and one of the reasons for a proxy server
3274420 attackers have started to compromise enterprises through the use of browser based and other client side vulnerabilities
3274421 this also applies to home users who are becoming increasingly more security savvy hopefully the releases of internet explorer 7 0 and firefox 2 0 will make it even more challenging for attackers to compromise the browser
3274422 if youre really paranoid surf with active content disabled use opera or firefox and run your browser with very little permission settings
3274423 there is no way of ensuring that the networks they connect to arent run by a malicious attacker
3274424 while the unsuspecting user surfs the web an attacker could be using a man in the middle attack to monitor their traffic or even worse use a client side attack toolkit to compromise their machine
3274425 attach away just tunnel through with ssh or a vpn client
3274426 also be aware of low level attacks and dont do anything too sensitive
3274427 the safest reasonable attitude right now is that even browsing available wireless networks is risky
3274428 most web sites handling sensitive info use ssl to protect the data in transit check for that
3274429 ssl has had some issues but its the best thing out there
3274430 of course we probably dont know about it when they do suggesting this problem could be vastly worse than it looks
3274431 the biggest security challenges businesses face with business social networking like linkedin is the sheer amount of information that a social engineer can learn by doing simple searches
3274432 attackers can find out who your business partners vendors and clients are simply by viewing your shared connections
3274433 services like linkedin try to guard sensitive employment information by restricting it to colleagues you have to have worked with dave goldsmith before to be able to click on him and see his work history or have him come up in a search for matasano
3274434 but anyone can sign up to linkedin and claim to have worked for matasano
3274435 its different than having drinks with a buddy after work
3274436 activex controls and their browser can be used by an attacker to get into the corporate network
3274437 there are a lot of web app vulnerabilities weve seen
3274438 every subpage you go to in linkedin or myspace is like going to a whole different web site
3274439 its most risky when youre going to the sites of people you dont know
3274440 you should assume that anything you post to a social networking site is public
3274441 you dont want to know what goes into the making of sausage
3274442 i then looked at my husband and he was already bleeding and coming towards me
3274443 i was just scared that he had one bat that he was going to bash my head in you know what i mean
3274444 i told them watch out he has a gun watch out he has a gun
3274445 that my husband is bleeding to death that he had stopped bleeding that i cant be a single mom that my sons no longer going to have his dad
3274446 all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others
3274447 warriors have never been a particularly good duelling class they are the kings of group pvp
3274448 warriors worst match ups are against good kiting classes and between cyclone and roots druids are one of the best
3274449 its basically a battle of heavy hitting melee classes where one of them can heal

3274464 as our consumer base continues to grow and evolve we are dedicated to creating new technologies that not only meet the current demands of the market but also exceed consumer expectations
3274465 we are confident that adnan will provide valuable experience to further enable tiny prints to scale up as we optimize our websites products and services
3274466 after doing our research in the very crowded world of search engine marketing companies we agreed that medium blues attentiveness to details during the pre sales process and reputation in the industry made the choice clear
3274467 in the short time we have worked with the search engine marketing companys professional and knowledgeable staff we have already seen great results in our organic search rankings we look forward to furthering the progress of this seo campaign and anticipate a great long term relationship
3274468 we look forward to delivering top notch results and seeing ids leads and traffic increase dramatically in the coming months
3274469 there is no question that the current housing market has created problems for some families and tremendous opportunities for others
3274470 there are so many fantastic buying opportunites out there right now im personally trying to raise 10 million in capital to expand my own investment portfolio
3274471 absolutely but i also believe that for those that do not they may fail to include into their buying decision the vital role that population trends have on our economy and the county in which we live it is by carefully analyzing these figures that we can reasonably predict future housing demands
3274472 with an increase in future housing demands and a limited supply of land to build on existing home prices are likely to appreciate in the foreseeable future
3274473 investors recognize this and are patient enough to wait awhile to reap the rewards your average homebuyer is more emotionally connected with the day to day value versus the future value thus missing out on future equity appreciation
3274474 population has increased by 36 6 since 2000 making prince william county the states second most populous county

3274480 we will mobilize supplies from outside the country as well but of course all of this depends on a cessation of attacks on georgia we need all parties to observe an immediate ceasefire
3274481 in an interesting little twist to your standard turn based strategy rpg everything in the game is dictated by cards which carry everything from attack power to special skills even to a combined pool of movement points for your entire army that can be broken up as you see fit
3274482 take steps to ease tensions with georgia by reversing recently announced measures that undermine georgias internationally recognized sovereignty which have rightly caused great concern among our european allies
3274483 those are countries whose advantage it is to point the finger at a russian threat particularly georgia
3274484 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3274485 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3274486 the ability to customize workflows has allowed us to run almost our whole business on collabnet sourceforge enterprise from capturing business requirements and tracking professional services work to managing development issues and performing pci security compliance audits to providing customer helpdesk and even managing our hiring process
3274487 being able to templatize and reuse those workflows along with other project content will make it easier to standardize our processes to improve efficiency and reduce the learning curve for our teams
3274488 collabnet is the only industry solution that maximizes both simplicity and flexibility in the way the development projects are set up allowing teams to roll out development processes and adopt alm at their own pace
3274489 with the new project page and templating enhancements visual studio and eclipse integrations and the attractive new server pricing teams of any size can now realize the benefits of alm
3274490 you hit me ill hit you even if it doesnt look like hes eaten in a while
3274491 the experience against zone defense will prepare us for our upcoming games against greece and spain in pool play and even some of the teams in the other bracket down the road like lithuania i think in this tournament we are going to see zone a lot
3274492 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3274493 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3274494 the team feels very strongly about getting the building permanently stablized and this happens by constucting the inside walls with the same wooden framing and attaching that with metal anchors to the original rock facade this construction should begin within the next week and half
3274495 i did not read the targets too well and paid the price i worked hard for the last four years but things just did not go my way today
3274496 i have not been in the best of form of late but i think my score was enough to reach the final at least it was a difficult day but i shot well in fact there were quite a few brilliant shots if there was a problem it was in reading the target it all depends on anticipation and therein things went wrong that it was not easy for anyone can be gauged from the relative low scores

3274515 over the last few years software development projects become increasingly complex teams become more distributed and cross platform development is the standard practice more than ever developers need a way to communicate changes and details to deliver a stronger final product more quickly

3274517 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3274518 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3274519 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3274528 humpbacks and southern right whales are making a comeback in much of their range mainly because they have been protected from commercial hunting
3274529 this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive

3274536 the more we can mobilize this community the fewer patents that will actually be granted
3274537 whatever happens in the patent reform world in the next u s administration is great but we have to act now to stop the granting of patents that threaten linux and open source in general
3274538 a production environment where we educate and train people to do this well work with them to make sure its put in a form that is acceptable
3274539 those are kind of the key areas to linux as it moves forward

3274553 sesa goa has given 1 1 bonus and they have reduced the face value from rs 10 to rs 1 so a person or a shareholder who has been holding 1 share is getting 20 shares they are undisputed leader in iron ore and coal the eps of the company is quite robust at about rs 600 crore profits the share translates into a p e multiple of close to 6 its share price now rolling at around rs 180 and rs 185 the eps should be at about rs 30 or may be more than rs 30 for fy09 on a reduced value post ex bonus on an rs 1 share
3274554 this is a very good stock but this gives a lot of volatility in the market you see a price movement within a range of rs 15 over a period of time so if one can really trade into the stock at these levels one can always exit at rs 190 and can re enter at rs 180 like this one could keep on doing trading but if one is not too fussy for making trading or not capable to do that probably he she can remain invested in the stock have a positive view you could see a price of rs 200 crossing may be next 3 4 months
3274555 ongc is a highly underrated stock it has been in an extremely strong long term uptrend from the year 2000 when it was rs 65 and it has gone to rs 1 200 in the year 2000 we didnt even know that oil could reach usd 100 bbl or lot more so one should absolutely hold on to it with a stoploss of rs 775 its a very good long term investment
3274556 for q3fy08 standalone bajaj hindustan ltd bhl reported marginal revenue decline of 4 4 yoy qoq decline of 6 4 to rs 4 6 billion 8 lower than our estimates of rs 5 billion the revenue from sugar segment decreased by 11 1 to rs 4 3 billion the revenue from the distillery division increased by 61 8 to rs 695 million while co generation segment reported the revenue of rs 101 5 million

3274558 sesa goa is an excellent long term hold its long term yoy returns have been one of the best in the market and though it has had a few downside swings it is tended to bounce back fairly quickly
3274559 sanghvi movers is the largest crane hiring company in india and claims to be the 10th largest in the world
3274560 last year they reported and eps of 17 75 on a stock price of at the moment rs 225 and this year potentially i would estimate their earnings anywhere between rs 26 and rs 27 so at that kind of value they trading close to about 8 times this years earnings so looking at a growth of about 35 i would tend to think that this is the stock to be had in your portfolio if you want infrastructure focus growing consistently so its a good stock to have in your portfolio
3274561 the regulatory utterances in last 6 8 months have been quite huge though meaningfully it has not impacted the actual business my sense is that competition is becoming intense and the winner takes all kind of situations building up where the number one player is using his scale economics to make the entry of new competition far more difficult and that is visible in the earnings of last quarter my sense is that if the growth of bharti remains far stronger than others the pricing power of the large scale is going to make life of other companies far more difficult hence my sense is that 30 35 40 growth in the industry is very much there and at 16 17 times it is under the grip of fear of some untoward happening to the sector but it is too dear to the economy and too bigger in infrastructure and the biggest success story my sense is that 15 16 17 times bharti is one of the good bets in the sector and it should do well
3274562 ialphageo is a typical niche player into seismic data process interpretation this company again is a consistent performer and its been growing 50 yoy and 50 in last financial year and the year before about more than 100 the first quarter numbers which were really big time they did a turn over of about rs 45 crore which was more than a 100 up and a fabulous margin of 52 whereas this sector reports a margin of anywhere between 40 and 45 with this company doing a margin of 45 as against the other players who report about 38 to 40
3274563 its order book is great and looking forward the nelp new exploration licensing policy program which the government has this is a consistent business where people have to execute projects worth rs 8 000 crore to rs 10 000 crore in seismic data acquisition alone this has a clear visibility of 3 4 years and therefore the earnings and the profits should grow on a very small capital base investors are likely to see a great return

3274565 ive never been the guy to put on a certain image just because i run the 100 meter dash
3274566 basically im the same person on and off the track i just get a little more intense when the gun is shot
3274567 i said mom kobe bryant asked about my leg she was shocked as well it was amazing
3274568 id rather be 100 percent going into the olympics than 85 percent with some races under my belt
3274569 i had a good chance in practice to see where im at and that kind of gave me a confidence boost
3274570 i definitely understand that suspicion comes with the territory because past champions have tested positive
3274571 thats why the olympic champion must go out and prove himself as clean
3274572 im staying hydrated and taking care of my body so im really confident that its going to hold up
3274573 i dont know how hes thinking but id assume its a lot of pressure hes under regardless of what anyone says
3274574 a jamaican guy came up to me in the cafeteria yesterday and said i hope you dont break up our 1 2 sweep im sure theyre hearing the same from their coach
3274575 but i would have to look at that after i won the gold medal this is one of the hottest 100 meter races ever in history
3274576 there are three guys who have run 9 7 two more guys 9 8 its amazing asafa is looking good and usain bolt is looking great as well i havent been on the track since the trials so im kind off in the background
3274577 both of them told me how hard it was to cut him because of how much integrity they felt he had
3274578 that meant more to me than any of the super bowl rings he has
3274579 if he had told me he wanted me to play safety or something i might have been upset but when he told me he wanted to go back to d line it wasnt a big deal
3274580 of course i wanted to see how the fullback experiment would have went but thats coach reids call
3274581 i havent seen enough fullback play to know how i was doing coach reid has seen a lot more than me he had a feel that maybe this wasnt going to be the right spot and i respect that
3274582 he was disappointed but danny is the kind of guy who tends to ask me what i think of stuff
3274583 i told him that he might have the quickness that defensive coordinator jim johnson is looking for i told him this is a team where you can really fit in he tends to take my opinion and run with it i know he really wanted to try the experiment and then all of a sudden bam its gone but he knew he couldnt be disappointed too long
3274584 im not everybodys cup of tea in the nfl but hopefully when i get on the field i can show them differently
3274585 i know im not the biggest guy down there but im a little quicker i feel i use my hands well
3274586 hes done a good job hes going to play a lot more thursday night but hes done a good job
3274587 my first two seasons in new england we won 28 games lost four and won two super bowls
3274588 coming from temple where you didnt win much of all and going to a team where all of sudden youre setting a record by winning 21 straight games thats pretty crazy it doesnt get much better than that
3274589 agyness deyn had to take the crown her influentially eclectic look trailblazing ability to segue between style personalities and pure fashion nous has had us captivated for months
3274590 the evidence that we have shows that your excessive consumption of alcohol was a contributing factor in the incident
3274591 when i read the cica letter i just had no words i could not take it in
3274592 it felt like i was being punished for having the audacity to step up and say i dont think this should have happened to me
3274593 it was like going back to the 70s saying she was asking for it
3274594 ground forces and quite extensive airstrikes completely destroyed what there was of georgian defences radar stations communications army bases
3274595 russia will sooner or later pay a rather high price for this
3274596 it changes the image of russia no doubt about that
3274597 quite a lot of talk about revenge especially from russian prime minister putin about taking revenge against a little country that has sought a different course
3274598 it hurts i think its something that no one should ever have to go through
3274599 but lifes not fair so its never going to be about that at the end of the day it happened and it seems that the sooner we can come to grips with that and process it the better off were going to be
3274600 i believe that random acts of violence are random acts of violence theres no indication here of any premeditation or anything
3274601 it seems just unfortunately a case of the wrong place at the wrong time
3274602 volleyball is my job my family is my life so that distinction has been very easy for me
3274603 very very very happy to report her condition is upgraded
3274604 not at the point where they want to discuss the specific nature of the injuries
3274605 fast eyes moving all the time that means a quick thinker
3274606 when we first went over to china for one international trip every four years we actually played against the shanghai sports school
3274607 i watched him train his team the one thing he definitely brings as an assistant i dont have to explain to him how you train a setter or outside hitter
3274608 if theyre absolute top tier theyre not even going to get a passport
3274609 if theyre at that level their best options are right there
3274610 their sophistication in the sport is usually at a higher level because theyre kind of on that sports track
3274611 theyve shown some promise in sports and theyve been groomed to excel athletically others are groomed to be a musician or an artist others who have shown great promise in math they are groomed in that area
3274612 if you have shown some promise or have bloodlines youll be pushed that way
3274613 in china we spent a lot of time on building skills
3274614 they learn technique for three years before they can actually compete
3274615 we had somebody from a smaller area in china they were denied a visa by the united states shanghai is easier beijing a little more difficult beijing has so many high profile people in various fields that the visa allotment gets used up a place like shanghai it seems like it functions like any other western city capitalism is ok there
3274616 two more are in graduate school and working one for sure intends to go back once she gets her graduate degree
3274617 one of the biggest problems at every university for example is drinking for undergraduates
3274618 drinking is just not a big deal they could have done it at any time thats not a big part of their lifestyle they seem to be more balanced they want to go out and see a movie or go dancing occasionally but it doesnt consume their life theyre here to serve a purpose not looking to get away from mom and dad and go crazy
3274619 the international connection has helped our program really attracting higher talented individuals
3274620 it would be difficult to attract that same level of talent in the united states theres just more competition for those players this was an avenue that fit for our university and our city we have such a melting pot
3274621 in china a lot of players go to sports schools
3274622 so we focus a lot on whichever sport we practice the coaches are very intense in china they dont give us many breaks we have to obey the coach or else we will get in trouble we only focus on one skill at a time so we can master that skill
3274623 i wish i could be there but i will be in preseason
3274624 there are a lot more people in shanghai philadelphia is more dangerous than shanghai the stores are always open late at night in shanghai so people stay out later and it is much safer
3274625 we dont do shuffle steps or anything like in america we cross over our feet because its faster
3274626 they have very good schools in shanghai just like ivy schools
3274627 but the education is better here in the united states the education in china focuses on books and themes here they focus on working abilities
3274628 you even have recruiting services that are basically scouting and giving out names on the international athletes including in china
3274629 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3274630 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3274631 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3274632 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3274633 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3274634 i set up an opportunity to have a perfect swim tomorrow
3274635 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3274636 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3274637 i knew when i saw the 1 by my name because at first i thought i saw the clock wrong its a great feeling
3274638 last year in melbourne at the world championships one swim started it and then swims just started happening one after another after another we had a great morning this morning and hopefully we can set up some more good swims tonight and keep the ball rolling
3274639 i just wanted to win my heat and set everything up for tomorrow
3274640 just get through that and prepare myself for tomorrow thats the most important thing an afternoon off and its time to just sort of get as rested as i can recover and i probably have to re shave get all of that stuff down
3274641 its up to them right now if they dont call down to the bullpen they dont call down but im ready
3274642 hes just now getting back to where he should be really
3274643 that hes sore every now and then goes back to the fact that he threw 120 pitches and hes only used to throwing around 30
3274644 before the all star game it was feeling a little maybe like i had a tiny bit of tendinitis in there not bad if i would have just thrown regular at the all star game it probably would have gone away because i had the other three days off over the break but that didnt allow it to recover
3274645 we extended a little bit more than what we anticipated but after observing him down in the bullpen today it was well worth it
3274646 its better every time we see him theres a huge ceiling for him the father has been a professional player and theres a lot of good things there
3274647 i cant remember the last time i played that much it felt good to get out there and banging heads with people and playing with the guys
3274648 ive said it before i think this is a big year for mac
3274649 at the least i saw a guy who was getting upfield and getting after the passer
3274650 hes kind of climbed the ladder and then he had a setback
3274651 that happens hes come out and hes played well hes put all that behind him he feels good and he seems to be playing productive football
3274652 first of all you just want to get them out there working
3274653 he hasnt played yet hopefully hes going to be ready to go thursday night were going to play him quite a bit hes just got to get used to that playing speed with us and getting used to the defense
3274654 hes going to go against a couple of good receivers this week hell be up to the task he just needs to make sure hes comfortable with the defense
3274655 it couldve been great in his situation hes finally maturing at age 35 sometimes its you sometimes its me he thought for so long it was someone else but at some point maybe it dawns on you that its not everyone elses fault
3274656 im confident our team started to get a little more confident after several rotations and started having more fun it was a great time
3274657 hes one of the easiest guys ive ever known to get along with
3274658 nba commissioner david stern has told those associated with the cubs that cuban is one of the nbas best partners
3274659 and everyone appreciates that cuban understands fans and marketing and is one of the creative pioneers of the world of new media and would create a tremendous buzz throughout baseball that would be nothing but beneficial to the industry
3274660 so he might yell at umpire joe west george steinbrenner did a lot worse to umpires and what steinbrenner did for baseball because of how he grew the yankees will put him in cooperstown and put a lot of money in other owners pockets
3274661 we didnt want to let them stick around we wanted to let the crowd know that we were ready to play you dont want to play around with teams if you have a chance to make a statement and put them away early you do that
3274662 it was the first time they werent doubling the post
3274663 anyone on this team could do it any given night
3274664 i dont feel the defeat today brings too much pressure
3274665 watching the game from the stands sunday really motivated us
3274666 seeing lebron james block a shot with two hands off the backboard and just the way they were playing defense got us ready everyone came into this game knowing the crowd could be a factor
3274667 it was a remote controlled explosive device which was planted under the bridge
3274668 apparently it seems linked with the situation in tribal areas
3274669 artistic hands had changed the garden into a festive place of rare beauty
3274670 their job is to cheer for both sides and generate a good mood
3274671 many people do not bother to turn up for the preliminary events but thats not surprising
3274672 i think you have got to put a lot of that down to the preoccupation with security
3274673 unless the milf renegades will comply to leave peacefully we shall continue our clearing operations
3274674 amid our intensified operations we will not compromise the lives of the civilians residing in the affected areas
3274675 they were able to drive away those who forcibly occupied the villages
3274676 there is resistance from the milf but this is not insurmountable
3274677 any time you have a preseason game you take the good and the bad
3274678 i dont think we did a good job on the blitz as they scored a touchdown and there were a couple things where we just didnt have really good outside run support
3274679 there are some good things too i just hate to see anybody take the ball down the field and score but it was a team that we hadnt worked on that much and it surprised us a little bit how they would run the ball that much am i disappointed the way we played sure that series
3274680 we had a blitz on and i think he just underestimated holmes speed and wasnt quite in a good position to make the tackle
3274681 we had some problems last year and we kind of got away from that a little bit if it happens again yeah ill be worried but im not now
3274682 just like we had a good opening drive offensively and almost took it down except for a penalty those things happen in the first game disappointed yeah but im not too concerned right now if it continues like that ill be disappointed
3274683 its a joke and a kangaroo court im not even sure if i should apologize for calling liberal mp and committee chair paul szabo the captain kangaroo of the whole thing
3274684 the difference in the case of the conservative party frankly seems to be that we did more of it presumably because we had the resources to do so i can find nowhere in the act where it refers to the concept of some of this being okay but more is not
3274685 should go back to making tea for brian mulroney and stay out of serious peoples business
3274686 i can guarantee it wont be like that the rest of the tournament
3274687 two more days of racing and hopefully the medal race if everything goes well i feel fine with the position im in
3274688 the ioc means business in stamping out those who are not playing by the rules
3274689 we are going to hunt down the shameless people who are causing harm to the health of our athletes
3274690 we will look to apply the maximum law to totally clamp down on drug taking in sport we will go to the courts because we want to jail all the cheats
3274691 its unfortunate and frustrating snakebittens probably the best phrase you could use
3274692 i told him that all i had here for him was a dh if he did not want to accept that do not accept the trade
3274693 im still confused by the article because it talks about platoon doesnt set well gary sheffield never platooned here
3274694 i come in some days and i dont play and some days i play thats platooning to me
3274695 you might think its different its not a big deal but thats the way i feel
3274696 ultimately the appointment of a supreme court justice is a function of the executive
3274697 not exactly the foot that most canadians would want to see put forward
3274698 im thrilled to be part of the flyers family again
3274699 i want to make the fan know what the players are thinking and what the coach is saying in different situations its a new challenge and im really looking forward to it
3274700 i understand it was that way in the locker room when he played and you can see it in the way he interacts with the fans he has a personality that makes you feel comfortable
3274701 we both thought it was time to go in different directions
3274702 still be an active member of the flyers family in his role with the alumni and their functions

3274704 with an ebay business you set your own hours and set your own goals
3274705 you can work as much or as little as you want and whenever you want many sellers supplement their income by selling on ebay and many others have turned it into a full time business
3274706 domestic institutions reported having tightened their lending standards and terms on all major loan categories over the previous three months
3274707 it reinforces the view that the economy will be weak in the next several months and there will be renewed pressure on the fed to start easing again
3274708 when the fed started to cut rates mortgage rates and other rates were actually lower than they are today
3274709 to say that things are easier in many areas of credit would be mistaken
3274710 when times are tough the herd starts running in the other direction with tougher standards pretty much across the board
3274711 large majorities of domestic respondents reported having tightened their lending standards on prime nontraditional and subprime residential mortgages over the previous three months
3274712 very large majorities of domestic and foreign respondents pointed to a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook their banks reduced tolerance for risk and the worsening of industry specific problems as reasons for tightening their lending standards
3274713 about 60 percent of domestic banks a slightly larger fraction than in the april survey reported having tightened lending standards on commercial and industrial loans to large and middle market firms over the past three months

3274751 in this case it was not the police that were setting mr read up to entice mr read to come over here to have sex with what he thought was a 15 and a 17 year old girl
3274752 in my experience ive never encountered this where an estranged wife has been the one that set up the sting
3274753 he acknowledged that he came over based on the text messages that were sent to him to have sex with a 15 and 17 year old girl
3274754 it has been more than 4 years that i have been suffering from painful monthly periods and other abnormal symptoms attached to endometriosis my ob in the philippines gave me 2 choices go for pain relievers or a hysterectomy i opted for pain relievers since i could still bear the pain even if the medication had minimal effect on me twice i was rushed to the emergency way back 1998 and 2000 and the doctors couldnt determine the cause of my pain my ob found 4 growths in my uterus in 2003 and suggested that i bear another child to hopefully lessen the pain since 9 months of pregnancy means 9 months of no monthly period then we had sandra in 2004 but having a second child was not the solution to my problem pain became more severe and more abnormalities followed i still had my regular check ups with my ob in the philippines whenever we were in town the growths were getting bigger the pain relievers were no longer effective and heavy flow was a discomfort on our first attempt to get a second opinion from a male ob here in singapore i was told outright to go for a hysterectomy since the 7 not just 4 growths in my uterus wont get any better and the pain will be more severe if we dont do something about it the findings adenomyosis with tumor markers in the ovary if the normal size of a uterus is that of a pear mine is a watermelon with 7 lime sized growths the total weight of this whole mass taken out from me is 300gms thank god that the biopsy done on my ovary showed that the cyst is benign so both my ovaries are still in tact statistics show that 1 out of 3 women in the us have hysterectomy caused by endometriosis or adenomyosis but mostly in women who are 60 and above we still lack the knowledge or proper information on prevention and early detection of womens diseases therefore most women will go through all the pain and the ultimate solution is a major operation women particularly in the philippines are not well informed on the importance of a regular papsmear hpv test cervical cancer vaccination or regular transvaginal ultrasound mammograms since we would only see a doctor when we are pregnant or feel some pain secondly these procedures are quite costly the post operation first 24 hours was really painful i would say 3x painful than my caesarian but i just kept praying and thanking the lord that i am lucky that we are covered by a comprehensive insurance that we did not have to shell out a single cent edgar was with me the whole time and so was my bestfriend liza well wishes and prayers from all of my family and friends gave me the strength i needed my upaas friends here in singapore kept me company alternately for 3 nights and my room was filled with baskets of red flowers and fresh fruit the stroller moms who visited me brought food made me laugh gave me gas pains and brought joy to my heart while i was still in pain a visit from my sister coralline hubby ricky and daughter eya from australia made the days before my operation less worry free for we were up and about going around the shopping malls i look forward to more bonding with another good friend agnes lapena my co member in the down syndrome association phis who will keep me company for the next 9 days of my recuperation she and her family are dear to us 1 get an insurance that will give you a full coverage ours is cashless that we just had to show our insurance card thanks to pearl energy limited for giving this as one of edgars privileges in the company he works for 2 for female friends and relatives have your papsmear hpv test and mammogram annually include a transvaginal and ultrasound ca125 blood test to test tumor markers dont wait til you feel the pain it may be too late 3 save enough for your medical needs our health must not be neglected or our family and savings suffer 4 be a good person ha ha you will need all the kind words from the friends who are dear to you 5 open up to someone when you are in pain it is difficult to be alone when you are not feeling well being in the company of those who love you uplifts your spirit it also helps to talk to someone who went through the same procedure 6 keep praying for strength and for those who love you and trust the lord that he will listen to your prayers 7 get ready for the next reunion of your family or friends or reunite with long lost friends and bridge the gap with people you have had some misunderstandings with life is short

3274769 theres just a general feeling of uncertainty related to the economy
3274770 it definitely has become a huge concern as it centers around general satisfaction and ability to recruit and retain workers
3274771 they employers realize that long distance driving to work is past becoming a hassle it has now become an economic issue and the companies are addressing it by giving employees options
3274772 peoples lives outside of work may not allow a 10 hour day they may be going to school they may have secondary jobs they may have day care issues with their children were looking at all that

3274796 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
3274797 to the mall the playground playdates to target just to go somewhere
3274798 if youre a stay at home mother youd better have a darned good reason to go somewhere
3274799 we just dont have as much money as we used to
3274800 i was famous for running here and there to get ingredients
3274801 if i was missing something id run out and get it i dont do that anymore i sit down and plan meals two weeks ahead then buy everything at once
3274802 its easier to decide to opt out if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
3274803 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
3274804 we are not staying home with our children by default
3274805 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
3274806 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheck wont come its that much more frightening
3274807 there are times when i think if i were back at work i could afford this or that
3274808 we want to teach the younger generation about this so they hopefully can solve the mess that some of us adults have created
3274809 this ice has become destabilized with cracks over the past six years and recent open water conditions on the ice shelf have facilitated the latest break off
3274810 making the triple a all star game and olympics i think ive opened some eyes
3274811 i saw fear in hitters their object was not to get killed
3274812 hes right up there with the top two intimidating pitchers ever
3274813 but the oakland as are proud of having them be a part of team usa
3274814 the experience they get over there will be worth it pitching in that environment in high pressure situations will be great for their development
3274815 hes grown into his body and his confidence has jumped his body language looks like he belongs in the big leagues brett also carries himself with a ton of confidence and his command is phenomenal he can place his fastball where he wants and he competes hes got some bulldog in him
3274816 of course youd want to play for your country but its even better to get an opportunity to play in the big leagues
3274817 we have an offday at home and maybe we can relax and get away from baseball
3274818 come back with a little revived spirit on tuesday and get back on track
3274819 but weve got to start swinging the bats better thats the main thing
3274820 id say as far as being out of sync it probably was
3274821 this is probably one of the best days in camp
3274822 we were making the right calls adjustments and breaking on the ball
3274823 he took me under his wing and taught me how to be a professional and how to be a student of the game
3274824 were going to get together and everything ive learned over my years im going to help him take his game to another level
3274825 i dont want to start anything but its frustrating when we dont score runs i tell you this is a team sport im not blaming anybody or pointing fingers as a group were not scoring runs thats it these pitchers are giving up three runs or less and still getting a loss
3274826 at the end of the game all that matters is who has more runs
3274827 you can get anyone from the stands and let them try it in the big leagues its not about trying its about doing it myself included
3274828 i got pretty close i did the best i can ill come back tomorrow and keep working
3274829 the high price of gas has pretty much grounded us for the summer
3274830 they may drive me nuts but i love my kids
3274831 if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
3274832 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
3274833 we are not staying home with our children by default
3274834 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
3274835 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheck wont come its that much more frightening
3274836 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
3274837 to the mall the playground playdates to target just to go somewhere
3274838 if youre a stay at home mother youd better have a darned good reason to go somewhere you wonder where can i stop by on my way home from another errand
3274839 we just dont have as much money as we used to
3274840 i was famous for running here and there to get ingredients
3274841 if i was missing something id run out and get it i dont do that anymore i sit down and plan meals two weeks ahead then buy everything at once
3274842 maybe it was my birthday in may last year not this year
3274843 to find a job that pays something decent i would still have to drive an hour each way at 4 30 a gallon
3274844 i go to five places in one day with three kids its horrible
3274845 how can we justify eating out when we could go to a store and buy enough for a couple days worth of meals
3274846 theres just no time to regroup none left for ourselves
3274847 im trying to work out a baby sitting swap arrangement with friends
3274848 if it works well go and see the new batman movie maybe
3274849 going into tonights prelims i was just hoping to be 2 12 or better to make top 16
3274850 i wanted to get in the semifinals with the least amount of effort i have the 100 back and the 200 im double tomorrow and thats very difficult im embracing the challenge
3274851 itll be a good race tomorrow im trying to save it
3274852 my fianc gave me some tips in between trials and finals
3274853 he was giving me some pointers he used to be a breaststroker and is now a coach
3274854 i was proud of everybody the relays are the fun events four guys who really want it we all had to swim a perfect race we had to do everything as a team
3274855 im a great believer in making it your own responsibility whether you win or dont win
3274856 it was one of those shots you like to have in the final round you get to the back nine and you take the shots and you take the responsibility
3274857 partnerships with leading e commerce software providers gives our customers smrs the same reach as the large chain stores and allows them to compete more effectively
3274858 because we pre integrate solutions with our retail management software our customers have cost effective access to tools that help them grow their business
3274859 its been a situation that unfortunately we havent brought guys in i control what i can control come out every day and get our guys as good as we can
3274860 we dont have seven guys to practice so i dont know we could have seven on our roster
3274861 with a lot of guys down weve got to take a lot of reps to me i dont think of it as a bad thing because the more reps the better
3274862 but we need to add to the bottom of the roster theres a number of things we need to look at we need to improve our depth and our competition on this roster
3274863 i heard prior to the meet that if i won it would be the first time
3274864 that added a lot of pressure and made me nervous im very very happy its my best time gold medal im still overwhelmed with emotion
3274865 it was a very strong morning for the entire u s team
3274866 for me personally the 100 back has been progressing faster than any other female event for me to win gold in such a strong event im very proud thats why i was crying like a baby on the stand it was really emotional it hasnt really sunk in yet
3274867 when i first saw the time i thought they had made a mistake
3274868 it was a very fast time when i saw the 1 by my name i thought they had made a mistake then i saw my name there and i realized that id got it
3274869 im ecstatic to be on the podium im very excited to have gotten the silver medal natalie had a great race
3274870 im really excited its my first medal of this olympics im thrilled its something you can never expect i knew i had a shot at it but its not something you take for granted
3274871 the last few days before the meet began i didnt feel as strong mentally as i was hoping to be i was able to get my head together and perform i was trying to keep my mind and head together i had a focused warm up and that helped me stay in the game
3274872 my first three medal races weve done everything i wanted to do so far im very happy with how things are going so far very happy with how things went this morning
3274873 it wasnt easy putting that behind you with all the emotion of that relay
3274874 i had to force myself to put it out of my head i have so many races and so much to do i have to be 100 percent focused
3274875 it was the most amazing swim ive ever seen and it got all of us pumped up
3274876 i wanted to try and get out into open water and i was in the outside lane so it was kind of difficult for the others to see me
3274877 i just wanted to get out there and try to hold on i knew taehwan park was going to have a good last 50 so i tried to start as far ahead as i could in the first 100 to 150
3274878 i just had to get out there and race you cant let it affect you
3274879 getting third in the 200 free four years ago when i do lose a race like that it motivates me further over four years ive been able to make some significant drops in time in the 200 free
3274880 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names its a pretty amazing accomplishment
3274881 in china hundreds of players are the same level and you dont try out the coaches pick the teams
3274882 i looked up and saw matt grevers next to me and i was elated
3274883 stuff like that is a dream come true im a little bit excited a little bit relieved and absolutely elated i am extremely happy for matt it means a lot to me and more to him and his family
3274884 its still registering who could have asked for more maybe it was yesterdays mens 4x100 freestyle relay that inspired us all who knows it definitely worked for me
3274885 it was just the empty space under the power lines nothing was growing there but it was our playground
3274886 i guess thats where everything started for gio its like one of those movies going from there to the big leagues
3274887 he went from nothing to this its hard to believe it we played with tires and cardboard for bases threw them down under the big electrical poles if you hit it left or right youd hit a window and youd be out so we all learned to hit it up the middle if we had a rock to hit and a broomstick to swing we were playing
3274888 i remember he threw it once in khoury league youth baseball and you could see the ball bite straight down from center field
3274889 everyone said thats it never mind there was no way anyone could hit it
3274890 i remember throwing the curveball to my cousin and it started at his face and almost hit him in the foot
3274891 he dropped his glove and said forget it i dont want to catch
3274892 im telling you i cant wait to put on that white uniform
3274893 wherever i go home i get a warm welcome from everyone
3274894 they treat me special but not because im a baseball player but they know me they know my personality they know ill talk to anyone
3274895 he can meet you today and he wants to try to help you theres a bum in hialeah and gio is his best friend everyone who sees him has to give him money and food because of gio he goes over and above
3274896 whatevers in my pockets whatever is in the car i can have 10 bucks and be starving but i think well i have a home i can go to so i give it to him
3274897 ive told everyone if they pass joe under the bridge at 103rd make sure to give him money or food or books because he loves to read
3274898 i dont know anyone in naples my friends are here in this block my aunt is in the next block everyone here has helped me this is my support
3274899 it feels like that community is with me forever it has to be
3274900 its a fresh new start hes here well work hard with him
3274901 is 100 percent now it took about four weeks for it to get fully recovered im fully confident my hamstring is 100 percent im very confident it will hold up
3274902 a guy from jamaica came up to me yesterday in the village and said to me i hope youre not going to break up our sweep 1 2
3274903 anyone can be the favorite right now its a matter of handling the pressure this is probably the hottest 100 meters in history
3274904 having three guys running 9 7 in the same race its amazing
3274905 when you look at that field its about who can run four rounds right now there hasnt been this much hype around the 100 meters in a long time with three guys who can run 9 7 anything is possible
3274906 i think the world record can go under 9 72
3274907 when usain bolt ran 9 72 i realized in order to beat him i have to run 9 6 you just have to adapt to what people are doing
3274908 sure you can its a gift from me to you a token of friendship and international goodwill and all that
3274909 offensively weve had a difficult time trying to run the ball against them
3274910 theres a lot of talent and a lot of competition and those are two ingredients for a very good line
3274911 we have a strong quick competitive line finally we are at a point where we are going up its not a huge learning curve anymore people are sharpening their skills working on the details and practicing hard
3274912 im running better moving better its made a huge difference its paying dividends
3274913 its amazing how it turned around for the line over the summer theres some buzz out there but we need to focus on getting better
3274914 in the future we certainly both want to have kids
3274915 weve been together eight years we want to win a gold medal then have kids
3274916 there are a lot of mothers playing pro beach volleyball they all came back stronger and happier i hope to be pregnant soon after the olympics take a year off and come back
3274917 its hard to be so self involved for so long
3274918 were more in control of ourselves and our game weve cleaned up every aspect of our game tightened everything up
3274919 we could not be more thrilled to open this new branch in taiwans flourishing technology market

3274933 bhp and rio have both been quite strong its mostly that move in bhp and rio thats pushed the market into positive territory today

3274941 people particularly enjoyed being long on australian dollars on the back of a weakening us dollar especially as commodity prices were going up and it had a high yield
3274942 in the space of a very short period of time all those planks have been pulled out from under the aussie
3274943 i think what the market is overpricing by a long shot here is the idea that the us economy will somehow outperform europe it wont

3274959 t is a forward looking platform in so many areas including those relating to lgbt people the task force action fund is certainly pleased to see that in the opening paragraph of the section titled a more perfect union for the first time the platform explicitly calls for an end to discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity this demonstrates the success and unprecedented partnership between lgbt advocates and courageous public leaders including representative baldwin in educating the public and policymakers on the need for fully inclusive anti discrimination protections
3274960 the 2008 platform reiterates and strengthens past support for legislation that would protect our community including calls for the passage of hate crimes and comprehensive employment discrimination legislation and the repeal of the discriminatory
3274961 this platform stands in stark contrast to a republican party which continues to marginalize millions of americans from full inclusion in public life just because of who they are or the person they love

3275011 our spies have brought bad news from the human tenants of the first floor of this factory building today they plan to fell this tree
3275012 we need to plan an evacuation while half the squirrels will execute the evacuation the other half will try to locate an ideal place for a transit camp well also have to pack some rations
3275013 why dont we wait and see whether the humans actually cut this tree down what i mean is its a somewhat senseless activity isnt it they would do it only if it hitched up their bottom line
3275014 i recommend that we stay put until they send the wood cutters
3275015 it isnt easy to move your house at such a short notice what if it were a false alarm then i wouldve gone through all this for nothing i am not moving
3275016 if we dont move now we might not have another chance
3275017 okay fine i agree with what you have said so far but do you all agree that there might be a threat to our tree
3275018 i recommend that we take a day off from work and all of us go picnicking to the top floor terrace its tuesday and the top floor tenants are working today we can go to their office and enjoy and well return in the evening if the tree is still here well go back to living the way we used to if not well ask the top floor tenants for temporary accommodation in their terrace garden what do you say

3275031 itd probably suit us a little bit better but as a back i think itll be great to get out there at three oclock and hopefully get some running footy
3275032 many experts in foreign policy say that one reason russia responded so forcefully to georgias attempt to take back south ossetia is that the united states and europe had been asserting themselves in russias backyard alienating moscow by supporting kosovos bid for independence
3275033 each country has its own specifics kosovo is a sui generis case
3275034 thirteen dead bodies and 15 injured have now been brought here
3275035 there were some paf civilians as well travelling in the vehicle we are trying to ascertain exactly how many were inside
3275036 we dont know whether it was a suicide attack or a roadside bomb
3275037 so far according to my information it was a security vehicle and an ied improvised explosive device was planted under the bridge

3275052 we encourage your closer cooperation with nato georgias leaders know that the peaceful resolution of conflict is essential to your integration into the transatlantic community at the same time the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia must be respected
3275053 constitutes a system of collective defence whereby its member states agree to mutual defence in response to an attack by any external party
3275054 the americans promised that nato wouldnt move beyond the boundaries of germany after the cold war but now half of central and eastern europe are members so what happened to their promises it shows they cannot be trusted
3275055 bush pressed the other nato powers to place georgias application for membership on the fast track the europeans rejected the idea understanding the geo strategic implications of pushing natos boundaries right up to russias border if the europeans had let bush have his way we would now be obligated by treaty to send troops in georgias defense that is to say we would now be in a shooting war with the russians
3275056 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3275057 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3275058 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3275059 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3275060 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3275061 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from tax and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3275062 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3275063 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff
3275064 hey heath ledger dies from drugs give the man a fucking oscar for batman
3275065 theres a line between being responsible for rebuilding a country you helped destroy and being a chump and i think we crossed that line
3275066 might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia
3275067 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia
3275068 the u n must stand up for the sovereignty of its members and peace in the world
3275069 they woke up this weekend and figured out that that ad resonated and they needed to do something about it
3275070 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3275071 it is unlikely that aggression against our nato allies will occur with aircraft and tanks and troops
3275072 a nation could achieve the same and worse effects simply by turning off the taps people freeze industry stops
3275073 paying more attention and letting these countries know we are paying attention is our main objective
3275074 given the characteristics of russian diplomacy which have been not only competitive but sometimes gripping people by the throat they are likely to feel irritated that someone else is in the field
3275075 the united states does not have a clear consistent strategy to promote our long term security interests or our near term energy and economic interests the russians do
3275076 it is a jihad because this individual should not be given the chance to destroy the countrys political stability and prosperity
3275077 if we allow him to lead the country he would lead us to destruction

3275083 the bombs hit in front of us and beside us
3275084 several people were wounded and lying in the street we got straight out of there
3275085 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3275086 there is of course a variety of other measures political or economic
3275087 the cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several us diplomats it is a real shame
3275088 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3275089 la russia ha invaso un vicino paese sovrano e ha minacciato un governo democraticamente eletto dalla sua gente tale azione inaccettabile nel 21esimo secolo

3275094 next time it will be ukraine or the baltic states the soviet union is coming back
3275095 it is as if some foreign country came to san franciscos chinatown and tried to get the chinese to break away from the united states
3275096 but a decrease of three or four really isnt relevant a lot that has to do with factors like how accurate the shooter was and how effective the emergency room treatment was three or four murders are within the margin for error
3275097 we had a 14 year old kid stabbed to death and it got a paragraph in the chronicle
3275098 i think the community feels like these things are going unnoticed ive been trying to get the mayors office to react but basically theres nobody home
3275099 youre going to let them spin this into something because i am running for election
3275100 i think it is a little better than that over 2005 2006 and 2007

3275105 in november we are going to have at least four new supervisors looking to cut their teeth it is the political season
3275106 is that the statistics really havent changed much in the last 10 years and weve been through a bunch of chiefs in that time what i am hoping is that these studies will show that there are other ways of doing things as well as what we are doing now that isnt working
3275107 i talk to the chief a couple of times a week
3275108 shes getting tired it wouldnt surprise me if in the fall or by the end of the year she says enoughs enough
3275109 city hall has been rife with that rumor for a long time
3275110 the entire bay area is correcting for the frothiness in the markets that occurred from 2003 to 2006 where by all rational economic accounts the market was outpacing what youd normally expect to see
3275111 tend to be some of the nicer parts that have higher priced real estate southern marin county such as tiburon and sausalito many parts of san francisco county and places that have benefited from proximity to successful technology companies such as palo alto and cupertino
3275112 areas of overbuilding have very steep price declines but on the coast and in areas where there is still significant employment growth prices are holding up because demand is stronger
3275113 that shows you the roller coaster ride in san francisco and how now youre coming down to more historically normal levels
3275114 you can see how exuberant the san francisco area got over the past eight years and as the winds were taken out of the sails as the market peaked what that looked like it was a more gentle decline from 2005 to 2007 then more precipitous declines beginning in early 2007
3275115 signs of stabilizing market would be that year over year declines are coming down
3275116 were not seeing substantial declines in year over year depreciation
3275117 theres no bottom in sight for home prices at this point
3275118 were all looking for a turning point there are no signs of that at this point
3275119 anyone whos looking to buy should definitely be in the market
3275120 falling prices are the sources of all the credit problems the world is currently experiencing
3275121 the world is going through a real credit crunch all of this rests on u s home prices having precipitated this entire crash

3275143 folk music is by definition irish pop music specifically irish pop music influenced by eastern european dance music
3275144 rave and trance on technical grounds should be classified as classical
3275145 bluegrass is african american actually its origin is french just like rap but it has nothing to do with folk folk is irish pop music concocted in the 50s and 60s which uses instruments that werent invented until the 30s
3275146 wrong the plays of aristophanes prove that the overwhelming majority of athenians were straight and idiogenogamotics were ridiculed as either being effeminate or only doing kologamosis in return for political or financial favours if this was not so then aristophanes would not have mocked the politicians in the front seats as boy fuckers kologamosis with young boys will illegal in ancient athens and those engaging in it were banned from holding elected office or made numerous bum gags or brought naked girls on stage for an all male audience to represent peace or written plays featuring female prostitutes hellenistic romantic fiction such as the aethiopica also disproves your claims that women were only regarded as baby making machines menanders dyskolos also disproves your claims as does book 3 of apollonius argonougtica and euripides hellen kolofilia was nothing more than masturbation just ask yourself why it was only with a man and adolescent boy because it was easier for the giver to think the receiver was a young girl than if it was with a man the same age he might as well have fucked a sheep or a goat so to get back on topic it makes you wonder why rtd made captain jack an omnisexual read complete wanker

3275157 let there be no doubt in your minds that the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilize this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america
3275158 dont allow the fruits of the victory achieved through the sacrifices of the mujahedeen fighting in afghanistan iraq and the tribal belt of pakistan to be hijacked by the politicians who sat passively while the girls and boys of the red mosque perished and burned
3275159 these are the same politicians who follow the tenets of an alien western democratic system and judiciary and exploit islam to fulfill their own greedy aims
3275160 calls for the people to support jihad in pakistan and lists a litany of grievances against the pakistani government and us involvement there
3275161 the north koreans know what they have to do in putting together that regime
3275162 we must do this because we cannot and will not tolerate innocent people especially children to be victims
3275163 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3275164 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years

3275187 its a definite business advantage and strategic advantage to communicate with clarity and coherence
3275188 all the audiences of these big companies are crying for clarity
3275189 a lot of corporations really dont know who they are
3275190 being able to describe a complex concept clearly and succinctly is really an indication of how well you know that subject
3275191 a lot of these guys they want to throw in the kitchen sink obfuscate with jargon
3275192 to get them off of that it takes a major war
3275193 when one country conquers another that is typically regarded as pretty serious and the inability to do anything about it is something the united states is not accustomed to
3275194 the path of freedom you have chosen is not easy but you will not travel it alone

3275202 warfarin dosing comparison of a pharmacogenetic algorithmic approach with the current empirical approach
3275203 if they didnt get irb approval and they didnt get consent from people and theyre taking the blood for research then its wrong on lots of levels
3275204 im honored to know a person like tom ridge who had every opportunity after he graduated from harvard not to go to vietnam
3275205 he could have found a doctor that would have given a certificate that he had a bad knee but instead he went and decided to serve his country during the vietnam war and he came back here to erie
3275206 thats the kind of people that this part of america produces
3275207 call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking get him down there and get him to work
3275208 if you cast a universal net my name might be on the list

3275228 severe diabetes mellitus is more likely to be associated with chronic hyperglycemia high blood glucose which in turn increases the likelihood of cerebral microvascular disease and may contribute to neuronal damage brain atrophy and cognitive impairment
3275229 our findings suggest that diabetes mellitus duration and severity as measured by type of treatment and the presence of diabetes mellitus complications may be important in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in subjects with diabetes mellitus
3275230 in contrast late onset of diabetes mellitus short duration of diabetes mellitus or well controlled diabetes mellitus may have a lesser effect
3275231 every speech should contain the line you were born in the middle of america
3275232 the deeply american values you grew up with learned as a child and that drive you today
3275233 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt make this a new american century the american strategic energy fund lets use our logo to make some flags we can give out lets add flag symbols to the backgrounds
3275234 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values

3275236 humpbacks and southern right whales are making a comeback in much of their range mainly because they have been protected from commercial hunting
3275237 this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive
3275238 we are just hoping that this wont last too much longer hopefully we are just waiting for our son to come back to us
3275239 i still keep that hope that he is still alive i dont want to look at the other side of it
3275240 and as washington embraced him john mccain hugged right back
3275241 lame duck status is when you dont exert influence anymore that is hardly the case with the president especially since were at war and hes still quite an active commander in chief
3275242 bush would not stay four days if he was not on his way out
3275243 refractive error is therefore the most common condition affecting the ocular health of the u s population involving young adults middle aged persons and older adults of all ethnicities

3275245 this clubs been close to it a few times but weve bounced back and hopefully bournemouth will
3275246 we were 15 minutes away it going into administration was in at 12 oclock and at quarter to 12 the chairman called us to say everything was okay
3275247 i know bournemouth manager kevin bond well i used to live round the corner from him played many games of golf with him and hes got a tough task on his hands
3275248 more importantly for us weve got to go there and get the result that everybody believes we should do
3275249 but its not going to be easy its going to be hard and weve got to work our socks off as much as we did on saturday to get the result
3275250 everyone who signs a pro contract at this football club should be good enough to play in our first team
3275251 whatever side i pick i expect them to perform to the rest of their abilities
3275252 lets save this for when i see you if we argue about it now well both decide not to get together
3275253 i watched obama when he was here and i think we need someone like him to advocate for us i have no doubts that hes pro israel mccain is too although like obama hes not a leader on israel issues i suspect that they would be pretty much the same as president
3275254 my friends and i prefer obama because when he defends us people will listen bush is pro israel but when he defends us all it does is emphasize how alone we are all we have is bush who is hated worldwide and commands no respect so who cares if he defends us everytime he opens his mouth we lose support
3275255 but when obama goes before the un or the europeans or the africans and asians and says look israel has legitimate grievances too they will pay attention
3275256 mccain cant do anything for us except make us look like a pariah defended by an old conservative president who is identified on the wrong side of every issue
3275257 of course i read his speeches i heard him talk off the cuff he knows israel deeply all mccain does is say there will never be another holocaust like hes some 70 year old jewish leader from america obama speaks a language the world understands and speaks it well mccain does tired talking points being defended by mccain will be a minus not a plus
3275258 no i think its half and half the young ones for sure the guys in the army they agree i mean who could be excited by mccain especially here where he means nothing but the continuation of bush look where that got us
3275259 what we need is someone who can come up with some new ideas about neutralizing iran we need somebody smart we dont need the same old ideas that dont work anyway i dont know for sure that things will be better with obama but i know they wont be better with mccain so the choice is obvious
3275260 if your president makes america more credible it makes your allies more credible too a president who is bad for america is even worse for us
3275261 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3275262 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3275263 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3275264 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3275265 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3275266 what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression
3275267 master cpl doyle was killed while he was protecting his position and his fellow soldiers

3275270 their normal contact drill is as soon as they get hit with something its 360 open up on everything that moves

3275275 we have suffered a loss of at least 20m rupees about 475 000 since this agitation began
3275276 and if the blockade continues it will be a disaster for us
3275277 if the world were to draw any lessons from what i did there would never be any wars
3275278 we dont get mixed up in political things sport is beyond politics
3275279 i dont want to support russia georgia or abkhazia but i think georgia is doing a stupid thing by making war during the olympic games
3275280 if we need we are ready to go back to georgia like soldiers because our country needs it if we need it but i think after the president asked us to stay here we have to respect this and stay here
3275281 its all the same to me who knows whos to blame
3275282 while beckham said he doesnt support britian ireland northern ireland he undiplomatically suggested that ireland was stupid to attack northern ireland

3275285 without fully employing its abilities even at the final moment the imperial nation is surrendering before the enemies propaganda
3275286 i never imagined the torpor of the nations leaders and people
3275287 will come off as a complete loser by accepting unconditional surrender even if it makes a few demands
3275288 the purpose of the greater east asia war is to achieve a stable east asia for the survival and defence of the nation
3275289 the sacrifice of so many people who died in the war would go unrequited if this purpose remains unfulfilled
3275290 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3275291 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3275292 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3275293 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3275294 over the years the endangered species act has become a regulatory nightmare that kills or stalls even the most well crafted land use projects
3275295 the economy suffers people suffer rational environmental planning suffers some careful streamlining is long overdue
3275296 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act
3275297 hay que marcar goles y hoy no fuimos tan efectivos
3275298 para ganar los partidos hay que marcar goles si no los hacemos se complica creo que tenemos buen desarrollo de juego pero el hockey se define en las dos reas y hoy en una no fuimos tan efectivos nos cost defender el c rner ellas tienen buena jugada fija ya lo sab amos y se termin empatando
3275299 aqu ya sacamos todo a relucir estamos en los juegos y cada partido es una final para llegar a las grandes finales
3275300 gran breta a tiene buen juego por la banda derecha pero nuestra intenci n era siempre igualarlo despu s de las recuperaciones se produjeron tambi n muchos contragolpes que no supimos aprovechar
3275301 el resultado te deja en una situaci n amarga ser un poco virtud de ellas y defecto nuestro pero es un partido pasado y hay que tratar de mejorar cuando vamos ganando para mantener el resultado me imagino que los rivales de argentina con un empaten se sienten contentos porque saben que somos un equipo muy duro

3275318 there are significant concerns regarding the available studies including quality credibility and methodological weaknesses such as the lack of control for confounding factors the small number of subjects and the dose of exposure

3275336 she has a ways to go but now she has a great chance to get experience in an international tournament
3275337 im really looking forward to it im not really sure what role ill have but ill play anywhere its awesome to be part of this

3275355 increasingly there are no limits technologically as to what a company can do in terms of collecting information and then selling it as a commodity to other providers

3275358 how many users visited their sites after seeing an ad
3275359 google is slowly embracing a full blown behavioral targeting over its vast network of services and sites
3275360 over 3 billion page views 15 million unique users and over 60 million video streams
3275361 people are starting to see oh we have these different industries that are collecting the same types of information to profile individuals and the devices they use on the network
3275362 internet cellphones cable any way you tap into the network concerns are raised
3275363 a broad approach to protecting peoples online privacy seems both desirable and inevitable
3275364 advertisers and data collectors who record where customers go and what they do want profit at the expense of privacy

3275371 sometimes what you listen to isnt always what you recall three days later
3275372 rather than guessing how listeners were listening this is actual info we can use this is why program directors are very excited
3275373 with electronic measurement you take away the burden of someone having to remember every time theyre in contact with a radio station
3275374 you definitely remember your two or three favorite stations with ppm you also get four five and six
3275375 real feedback minute by minute almost as to what works and what doesnt
3275376 by and large its a more accurate way of monitoring how people truly do listen to the radio
3275377 the overall audience is actually much larger but time spent listening is going to be less people change the channel a lot more frequently than they did in the paper diaries
3275378 its not that i didnt expect to see those differences but its way beyond that
3275379 we continue to be very very concerned about arbitrons samples and the reliability of the data
3275380 spanish speaking hispanics spend more time with radio than other groups
3275381 and the rounding effect on the diary occurs more with people who listen more
3275382 based on the results from houston there was a little bit more male listening than the diaries were giving credit for so we decided to shift one of our stations a little more male
3275383 since 1884 weve had a roll call vote its a nominating convention not a coronation
3275384 i dont think theres any harm in nominating sen clinton at the convention
3275385 it will acknowledge the success we had and it will give an opportunity for people to express themselves and get behind obama and win in november
3275386 its a simple thing to do and its the biggest sign of party unity
3275387 if we do that one thing the hillary people can get past it and move on
3275388 if the situation were reversed the obama people would feel the same
3275389 for the first time in a generation its been a close election and this was such a unique situation
3275390 sen clinton is going to do everything she can to make sure sen obama is the next president and that will include how the convention is handled and the role she plays
3275391 polls out there show that older women are the potential swing demographic in this election
3275392 it helps obama and the party to have her play a prominent role in the convention

3275405 they entrapped mr pratt into agreeing to the agreed facts
3275406 that we have somehow targeted his client for some unproven and presumably personal purpose is an extremely serious allegation that mr richter makes
3275407 the proposition that this is somehow a conspiracy is really well the evidence will speak for itself

3275423 an ivf cycle produces a number of embryos those that arent immediately transferred back to the patient and that are of good enough quality are cooled slowly to the temperature of liquid nitrogen 196c and stored until needed
3275424 conventional slow freezing creates ice crystals which can damage the embryo as it is thawed
3275425 vitrification differs from traditional cooling and storing techniques in that it allows instantaneous glass like solidification of eggs and embryos without the formation of ice crystals
3275426 since no ice crystals form a much greater percentage of embryos survive thawing following vitrification

3275587 i tried high and low to find someone who was not from too long a distance to cast i put notice out in edmonton and no one wanted to join the production so that was a real bummer

3275606 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3275607 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3275608 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters

3275618 i tried to keep myself as mentally strong as possible

3275623 just get through that and prepare myself for tomorrow thats the most important thing an afternoon off and its time to just sort of get as rested as i can recover and i probably have to re shave get all of that stuff down

3275628 we continue to be confident that our high levels of recurring revenues from our large diverse and stable client base predominantly in the mid market will provide a foundation for continued growth and that we will accrue the expected benefits from recent acquisitions during the year
3275629 the commissioning of novoshirokinskoye towards the end of this year is a significant milestone making it our second producing mine and one that will make a contribution to revenues early next year
3275630 the start of construction works in september at mayskoye one of russias largest undeveloped gold resources is of equal importance to the future of highland gold

3275632 e un grande risultato per me ha detto daniello nel dopo gara dopo essere scoppiato in un pianto liberatorio sono stato bravissimo soprattutto nellultima serie oggi era difficile battere un campione copme eller ma merito un bravo per come ho gestito il ritorno del cinese che stato anche aiutato dai giudici a un certo punto sentivo il suo fiato sul collo ma ho gestito bene la pressione
3275633 despite the challenging trading market our unique portfolio is showing relatively good liquidity and we expect overall full year sales values from our core and home reversion portfolios to exceed those of last year

3275635 severely damage competition on major transatlantic routes and leave consumers worse off
3275636 airlines everywhere are struggling with the current price of oil but the solution to their problems should not lie in an anti competitive agreement which will inevitably lead to less competition and higher fares
3275637 i remember that he arrived with his girlfriend a participant in the miss ekaterinburg competition but she stayed in the car pavel for some reason was nervous to show her off he answered very curtly and extraneous themes he treated obliquely this was not his first interview it turns out pavel himself said that not long before our interview in chelyabinsk he gave commentary on the dynamo mechel match but the first big interview was with me
3275638 without an invitations with a gift i went to the hospital and found out where pavel was

3275640 has anyone ever tried to steal the cup like the world cup
3275641 in 1961 at the chicago black hawks arena but the police intervened and in 1978 the same case occurred in a museum in toronto
3275642 the cup isnt made of rubber it gradually grows new rings on which the names of champions are engraved so the stanley cup grows in due course
3275643 the playoffs in the nhl is such a time when you are focused on one thing
3275644 its great that all of us here have gathered today

3275651 i received the assassin tang yongmings posthumous letter in my email
3275652 because no matter how the regime responds accepting or denying it it will become a catalyst for the spread of public anger
3275653 the similarity is both assassins are from highly civilized cities both used knifes both cases happened in places with heavy security both assassins selected the most sensitive time and place to obtain the strongest promotional effect
3275654 just preface your comments with a nod to his success

3275686 because that would make you edmund and i seriously doubt allison would enjoy being compared to the white witch
3275687 oh i dont know i could do worse than being known as sherriff carter the just but youre right if anyones the white witch in this town

3275698 unless we act quickly the gap between the haves and the have nots will grow uncontrollably exacerbating existing inequalities and condemning millions more people to poverty
3275699 now it is clearer than ever that the only way to end the gross inequalities that have condemned more than a billion people to linger in poverty is through a massive redistribution of power assets and opportunities
3275700 the way that country music and rock is such a separate industry here its nice to think we might f it up a little bit and that they might not know where to play our records

3275720 i was rather surprised in terms of some of the numbers that datacenters were using in terms of energy
3275721 all of this requires us to take a new approach
3275722 i really think where we are headed is to create true architectures for our datacenters
3275723 weve been virtualizing on the mainframe for 35 years were just talking about bringing that out into all the other environments as well
3275724 its not like theres a silver bullet the issue in implementing virtualization is doing the end to end architectural thinking around soa

3275742 in 2005 junk mail surpassed what we call first class mail as the majority of what the usps us postal service was delivering
3275743 in the last two years 19 bills have been introduced in state legislatures in the us none of them have yet passed what it shows is that there is significant popular demand for a solution to junk mail and enough so that some politicians felt that they had a stable foundation on which to introduce legislation but there is also signficant opposition and well financed opposition to a do not mail registry
3275744 mainly by developing skills through both academic and vocational training
3275745 and i was happy to help out this is an excellent cause
3275746 i feel that its important that we guide our young people in the right way to live our lives and so i am pleased to be able to support soy in this important work
3275747 i commend dms for its endeavours they have set a good example of corporate responsibility i am truly touched and honoured to have been selected as the namesake for this award
3275748 my purpose is and always will be to enhance the education of caymans children as they are our future citizens
3275749 with the leadership of the cayman islands government the educational system has made good strides and there are plans in place for continued improvement however there is great opportunity for funding from the private sector to help drive greater success
3275750 we are delighted with the response from schools and organizations its humbling to see so many worthy applicants making a concerted effort to improve schooling here in cayman the application review process is underway and the committee certainly has a tough decision ahead of them
3275751 on behalf of the committee id like to sincerely thank all individuals and organizations for taking the time to submit their applications

3275756 minoritatile nationale din romania au cate un reprezentant in parlament de ce sa nu mergem pe aceasta varianta si pentru romanii care traiesc in imediata vecinatate
3275757 s a avut in vedere cati au votat la europarlamentare la referendum si la alegerile din 2004 nu s a tinut cont decat de cei cu domiciliul stabil in strainatate si cu pasaport cei care au renuntat la buletin asa s a ajuns sa nu aiba drept de vot decat 190 000 de romani din strainatate in timp ce mai multe milioane de persoane nu au drept de vot
3275758 daca legea nu va fi modificata majoritatea romanilor din diaspora nu vor putea vota

3275760 we are excited that ronald will be competing in the 110 metre hurdles at the 2008 olympic games he carries with him not only his personal dreams and aspirations for a gold medal but also the hopes of his family friends and the wider cayman islands
3275761 we are confident that his academic and athletic successes over the years will enable him to be a stellar competitor and ambassador we wish him well and we are proud to sponsor his mom karen our staff member who will see him in action at the games
3275762 road safety should be a concern for all cayman islands residents
3275763 whenever you get behind the wheel whether it be for work or pleasure purposes you should consider if you are doing so safely businesses also have a responsibility to ensure their vehicles are in good working condition
3275764 hawaii has the largest home school population in the united states
3275765 give the parents an opportunity to meet and share information and give the children a much needed social outlet
3275766 you can get a lot more done in a shorter length of time
3275767 ive been very pleased with the teachers approach they provide a different voice for the children
3275768 take your records and stick it sad to see you go but we are ready to move on
3275769 in order to participate in world finals in arizona a rider must participate in a prescribed number of ijsba apwa international jet sports boating association australian personal watercraft association sanctioned events and be within the top 25 riders
3275770 unfortunately these events are not held in cayman therefore our riders must go overseas to participate and gain the recognition as a world class rider
3275771 we feel that the level of skill and competency in our local riders are well within the category this was proven with jason smith and he has only high respect for the local riders that currently compete locally therefore we think it is time for cayman to come forward and get the recognition that it truly deserves thru these young riders
3275772 following jac 2008 the participating teams got together to investigate the feasibility of forming a cayman team to participate in this upcoming event with the intent of going to such events until we qualify the riders for world finals
3275773 whilst we appreciate this would be much better supported if there was a local pwc association we feel this will spawn such an association through camaraderie and collaboration of the local teams coming together in such events
3275774 jet ski racing has become a passion and hobby for many caymanian youth and is yet another tie to our love of the ocean and our seafaring heritage
3275775 the supporting team members and organizers would like to create some local awareness and support for the youth that are going overseas to represent team cayman at this first effort and would also like to encourage corporate sponsorship for the riders
3275776 to preserve the windows doors and shutters we are going to have to store them we cant put them back up because well lose them
3275777 its the only way to arrest the decay of the wooden paintings
3275778 there are too many paintings and too much already in the house we will preserve her bed and table and the kitchen her paintings of course you can put in a controlled environment but for a house well the paintings on the walls cant be moved and well have to control the climate in the house somehow which is why this is so expensive
3275779 some on the walls of the original house and some on the extension are peeling
3275780 so we have to get a paintings conservator to look at them we have to analyse the flakes of paint and we have to learn about the amount of shelf life we have before we start losing them its going to be a long scientific process
3275781 we will do all the hard homework then bring all the parties together and hammer out one approach before we make the call
3275782 not as terrible as it appears to be but it needs a lot of work
3275783 we are not going to start though until we are as sure as we can be after september he said fund raising efforts would start involving ongoing public and private appeals and a telethon seeking to raise 1 million for restoration and help contribute to annual 100 000 operating costs
3275784 we will appeal to people personally and to private sector organisations such as banks it will be whole series of things
3275785 this is not just about miss lassies house but about cayman and preservation of its cultural heritage
3275786 these camps are another way that we can show kids in the community that people care about them and are here to help them as they go through life it is about sport and having fun but it is also much more than that
3275787 we build relationships with many of these kids over the years and help them stay focused on positive activities
3275788 the individuals that i have the honor of working with here at scholars international sports club display the kind of character and integrity and compassion that we should all aspire to
3275789 it is essential that we carry ourselves as strong role models for the children of cayman because their eyes watch us far more closely than we realize and their hearts can begin to harden to the suffering of others if they see adults turn away instead of offering a helping hand that is why i take such an active role in the organization and also in coaching these young people
3275790 theres a line between being responsible for rebuilding a country you helped destroy and being a chump and i think we crossed that line
3275791 senator coleman at any time could have done these hearings on reconstruction and he did none

3275793 absolutely ron george should be thrown out for voting for gay marriage
3275794 he has a very radical view of whats a family
3275795 i really felt that as chief justice i had to have the broad shoulders because i knew there would be substantial controversy about it
3275796 most people thought his legacy would be the modernization of the courts
3275797 i think the gay marriage decision will now be his principal legacy
3275798 it isnt anything that i have given any thought to i will do what i should do when that time comes about

3275807 it is unlikely that aggression against our nato allies will occur with aircraft and tanks and troops
3275808 a nation could achieve the same and worse effects simply by turning off the taps people freeze industry stops
3275809 paying more attention and letting these countries know we are paying attention is our main objective
3275810 people think its too flattering to me that alexei miller was kind of stalking me when i was in the region
3275811 given the characteristics of russian diplomacy which have been not only competitive but sometimes gripping people by the throat they are likely to feel irritated that someone else is in the field
3275812 the united states does not have a clear consistent strategy to promote our long term security interests or our near term energy and economic interests the russians do
3275813 the united states cannot offer an adequate alternative a political resource with no economic element is not enough
3275814 the students all gave much of their time and effort to undergo the weekend math trainings of the mtg to prepare for this tournament so we are hoping all of that would bear fruit
3275815 during the time that the bibles were set on fire the chief commander of sawa col debesai ghide gave a warning to all the students by telling them that sawa is a place of patriotism not a place for pentes pentecostals
3275816 eight male students to whom god gave boldness to speak against the burning of the bibles have been taken into custody in one of the metal shipping containers that the military at sawa uses as prison cells for christians who have been found practising their faith in the centre

3275842 my main goal is to get us into the eighth inning with the lead and unfortunately i wasnt able to do it
3275843 it was tough knowing we had a one run lead against a team like this that any one of them can hit a homer at any time
3275844 i knew there wasnt much room for error with beckett hes a great proven pitcher and he had his a stuff today
3275845 im just thinking about my next start and helping this team win as many games as we can
3275846 we got the hits when we needed them and got the win so im happy with that

3275857 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3275858 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3275859 over the years the endangered species act has become a regulatory nightmare that kills or stalls even the most well crafted land use projects
3275860 the economy suffers people suffer rational environmental planning suffers some careful streamlining is long overdue
3275861 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act
3275862 hey bob you wanna go out and see if that dust cloud cleared
3275863 whats the point of having nkes if you cant use them
3275864 and finally new rule in two parts a you cant call yourself a think tank if all your ideas are stupid and b if youre someone from one of the think tanks that dreamed up the iraq war and who predicted that wed be greeted as liberators and that we wouldnt need a lot of troops and that iraqi oil would pay for the war that the wmds would be found that the looting wasnt problematic that the mission was accomplished that the insurgency was in its last throes that things would get better after the people voted after the government was formed after we got saddam after we got his kids after we got zarqawi the whole mess wouldnt turn into a civil war you have to stop making predictions
3275865 william kristol poo pooed the fears that sunnis and shiites would be at each others throats as the stuff of pop psychology right and having your head chopped off is just a quick way to drop eleven pounds kristol of course is revered by much of the right because he was dan quayles chief of staff and was known as quayles brain you know that which sounded impressive until i remembered dan quayle didnt have a brain and now mr kristol proposes immediate military action against iran predicting the iranians will thank us for it hey you know what nostradamus why dont you sit this one out

3275867 would see their situation improved if they learned to take advantage of all the benefits available to them
3275868 in my experience 90 percent of the social workers themselves whose profession is to help the survivors dont know what benefits are out there
3275869 even the organizations that help survivors dont know what is offered by other organizations
3275870 the government has talked about establishing an information center for a long time but we cant wait for the politicians anymore
3275871 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
3275872 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
3275873 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
3275874 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
3275875 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
3275876 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
3275877 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
3275878 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
3275879 tape top cia official confesses to 9 11 iraq war forgery came from white house
3275880 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document
3275881 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
3275882 former president of the united states bill clinton was impeached by the house of representatives on december 19 1998 and acquitted by the senate on february 12 1999
3275883 when are you congress person stand up for the rule of law when is principle going to trump expediency when are you going to join kucinich and wexler in calling for impeachment hearings
3275884 we need to move on this just divides people americans are tired of hearing about impeachment
3275885 well youre a bit of a radical most people dont want to see another president impeached
3275886 we need to move on this just divides people americans are tired of hearing about impeachment
3275887 well youre a bit of a radical most people dont want to see another president impeached
3275888 weve now got lenders competing with each other on rates to get more business

3275929 separate bodies of research suggest that young children have a broad tendency to reason about natural phenomena in terms of purpose and an orientation toward intention based accounts of the origins of natural entities this article explores these results further by drawing together recent findings from various areas of cognitive developmental research to address the following question rather than being artificialists in piagetian terms are children intuitive theists disposed to view natural phenomena as resulting from nonhuman design a review of research on childrens concepts of agency imaginary companions and understanding of artifacts suggests that by the time children are around 5 years of age this description of them may have explanatory value and practical relevance
3275930 teleological functional explanations account for objects by reference to their purpose they are a fundamental aspect of adults explanatory repertoire they also play a significant role in childrens reasoning although prior findings indicate that in contrast to adults young children broadly extend teleological explanation beyond artifacts e g chairs and biological properties e g eyes to the properties of non living natural phenomena e g clouds rocks the present study extends earlier work with american children to explore british childrens application of teleological explanation the motivation is that while britain and america are culturally as close to a minimal pair as the global context affords there are differences in the religiosity of the two nations such that british children might be less inclined to endorse purpose based explanation results reveal that young british children also possess a promiscuous teleology although they differ in the kinds of purposes that they attribute additional findings include a replication of earlier effects using a modified task with young american children

3275934 the vast majority of genetic variation is not observed in traits
3275935 a gene is the unit of heredity and genes determine inherited features in an organism the set of genes in the genome interact to direct physical development and behavior genes are nucleic acid molecules such as dna or rna and carry information this information is contained in the base sequence of the nucleic acid molecule
3275936 the introns are thrwon in the trash leaving only the exellent exons
3275937 a gene is a dna or rna sequence thats transcribed
3275938 a gene is a unit of dna which is transcribed has a phenotypic effect when transcribed and whose phenotypic effect is altered by mutation
3275939 any phenotypic effect thus wouldnt be expected to change due to mutations in the intergenic region

3276044 ideally snack on something healthy like cucumber or carrots drink water they may not appeal to your palate during festivals but they will help you go slow on the portions the next day no matter how hard it seems make the effort to get out of bed and hit the gym or park a basic cardio workout and crunches will hold you together without tiring you out if you are not up to your gym workout walk for 45 60 minutes in a park nearby or cycle and if motivation is the problem sign up for a group workout session either for aerobics or salsa till the festival season lasts or get a friend or family member to exercise with you
3276045 there is no need to deprive yourself of any foods including sweets food cravings need not be suppressed but when you see foods that you cannot say no to accept very small portions for example if you like kheer and you love the gulab jamuns too take one tablespoon of kheer and half a jamun that way your palate is satisfied and you wont need to look the other way when you see that line up of mouth watering sweets
3276046 but moderation is something you have to train your mind to accept and never go without exercise the day after a festive meal do any kind of exercise that makes you happy
3276047 your bail conditions could allow you to go back to the camp once accompanied by a police officer to collect your things
3276048 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3276049 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3276050 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3276051 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3276052 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3276053 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3276054 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3276055 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3276056 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3276057 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3276058 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3276059 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3276060 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3276061 we are doing an analysis of these debt collection companies and find that they are more of a hindrance than assistance to municipalities
3276062 these companies retain 15 to 30 percent of the amount they collect we say therefore use debt recovery agents with caution
3276063 we have information that a group of men from manchester were in the club at the time and may have spoken to damian gordon we would particularly like to speak to them
3276064 there were a lot of people in club icon when the shooting happened and i want them to come forward and speak to us
3276065 we understand a lot of these people had travelled over from the manchester area that night and we are particularly appealing for them to come forward so we can eliminate them from our inquiries
3276066 we are in the middle of tracing those who were at the club using cctv from the area but it would be easier if you could come to us

3276090 it was on the sand bank with other crocs and hippos and we then isolated it this took a lot of courage because the hippos were also giving us a hard time

3276104 natos communiqu about the excessive use of force in the south ossetia makes moscow remember the operation of the alliance against serbia russia will not listen to such assessments from this military bloc because it would then have to remind of the disproportionate use of force against the people and armed forces of serbia when nato tried to give serbs joys of democracy through bombardment of belgrade destruction of serbian towns bridges and infrastructure
3276105 in 1999 nato assessed that slobodan milosevics policy is bad towards kosovo metohija albanians but it decided not to bomb only the serb troops in kosovo but the entire territory of serbia including bridges hospitals tv stations and state institutions thousands of serbian civilians were killed in those attacks
3276106 that is the major difference between nato and russia which limited its actions in georgia strictly to military targets im horrified when i hear those who were silent before thousands of serbian victims in 1999 giving themselves right to deliver moral lessons now theyll never have that right

3276129 was decided by three million votes and according to the census and a bunch of independent groups the average number of south asian americans living in the united states is three million
3276130 so if ever there was any question as to whether family background or immigration history or age was holding anyone back in being effective thats all pretty much dissolved
3276131 and we got proof to show that no matter what your background is that one vote and that one effort of making a phone call and reaching out and registering somebody to vote can have huge implications and a huge impact
3276132 depending on how much time you can put in you can head up particular regions you can help with youth outreach south asian outreach any kind of demographic outreach registering people
3276133 virginia is a battleground state and with your help we can definitely win it
3276134 it seems to me that the talk about people being divided like that was a pretty great media spin on behalf of the republicans whether you are supporting senator clinton or senator obama everybody wanted the same things and senator mccain is not going to bring our friends home if he gets his way for a 100 years from iraq
3276135 universal health care is not a priority and the last eight years of george bush tax cuts for the very very wealthy are going to keep continuing
3276136 so to me it seems like a no brainer and when we talk to folks those are the issues they are more focused on those are the ones we keep dialoguing about it seems really easy if youve seen the mccain ads to get distracted and believe the democrats are divided
3276137 i dont believe thats the case on the ground what do those folks really want out of a president do they want some sort of change in leadership moving forward by a man whos a civil rights lawyer and a constitutional law professor or do they want four more years of george bush
3276138 the whole issue of taxation to me is relatively simple
3276139 under the bush administration there have been huge corporate tax breaks where middle class families have to pay an unfair burden of taxes so what obama wants to do is reverse that so that big corporations are paying their fair share of taxes and working families will have tax reductions
3276140 the other question that i frequently get is arent you in a higher tax bracket and isnt barack obama going to increase your taxes and to that question the answer is kind of yes and its also a kind of certain responsibility that comes with the privilege that we live with to make sure that we are paying our fair share in taxes so that other folks dont have to decide between minimum wage or going to work in iraq
3276141 to say hi to some friends id never been up there before and hes got this wall that you really cant see from either the reception area or if you are passing by his office door
3276142 but if you are sitting in his desk there is a wall next to the door and on that wall are three pictures there is one of john f kennedy one of martin luther king and one of gandhi with the spinning wheel
3276143 that there for daily inspiration and the daily reminder of why he does the things he does and his commitment to public service
3276144 and i havent heard of anybody actually keeping these constant reminders every single day it was definitely an emotional thing to see on my part

3276150 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3276151 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3276152 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3276153 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3276154 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3276156 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3276157 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3276190 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3276191 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3276192 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3276193 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3276194 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3276195 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from tax and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3276196 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit

3276201 would kicking russia out of the g 8 have stopped this invasion
3276202 i dont see how those two are related that is the test of leadership are you proposing things that can advance american interests
3276203 to condemn russias aggression to call for an immediate halt to the violence and to review multilateral and bilateral arrangements with russia including russias interest in joining the world trade organization
3276204 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on
3276205 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe

3276237 the family had last seen him about noon family members had gone to the grocery store and left him at home
3276238 when the family came home around one his wifes cousin found him lying on the floor in the basement near a treadmill the treadmill was running so it is believed that he had been working out
3276239 there doesnt seem to be any foul play we dont see anything suspicious about his death there will be a further statement from the hospital about the cause of death
3276240 a few months ago i did a quick interview with entertainment tonight and i stuck my foot in my mouth and said that i was having twins by accident
3276241 i begged them to edit that out as i wasnt ready for it to be out there then but when i was i would give it to them exclusively
3276242 they really could have ran with it but they said they would not
3276243 theyve asked him for a million dollars and i hear hes agreed to give at least 500 000 250 000
3276244 obviously when youre talking about donors these are private things i would never reveal information about any donor
3276245 today and tomorrow will never be as funny as yesterday without bernie mac a true original
3276246 one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did
3276247 he felt as though the role was impacting on his own personal performance and was affecting the team
3276248 it is a brave decision by rikki and he deserves respect for putting the team and the club ahead of his own personal ambitions as a captain
3276249 he felt as though the role was impacting on his own personal performance and was affecting the team
3276250 it is a brave decision by rikki and he deserves respect for putting the team and the club ahead of his own personal ambitions as a captain
3276251 im alan yeah i just got into an argument with my drunk wife
3276252 we were 40 hours into this and now the doctors are getting concerned about the water being broken and the possibility of infection
3276253 i wouldnt say shes alves suffering but shes having to dig deep shes tired shes exhausted shes in pain when the contractions come youve gotta push and in between them those 30 second intervals shes passing out and then coming back to and that went on for hours
3276254 and we had this problem upon contractions the babys pulse would sink
3276255 the doctor called c section and as soon as they say c section 33 minutes later the babys out i was like 60 hours weve been in here and if wed have come in and just said lets just have it you could do it in three hours
3276256 last week me sic voice was a bag os te i had to have a word with myself i want this to be a success i want this to be great i thought im going to have to tone it down a bit
3276257 load of big fat lines load of cigarettes staying up late talking the same s t you talked the night before and the night before that thats not good for it his voice
3276258 we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3276259 that will be the start of a nationwide protest we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film
3276260 there are creepy crawlies in there and apparently they got real dangerous centipedes
3276261 you can try to control the jungle but no one could clear all the centipedes the nooks and crannies where they hide are impossible to find
3276262 on the very first day of shooting i was carrying the biggest gun and i had to be running shooting diving with the gun and i landed funny on the gun and i heard something pop
3276263 she eva asked victoria to come on board and help
3276264 victoria was thrilled and talked it through with her husband david but he thought she was spreading herself a bit thin and should concentrate on what she was good at running a successful fashion line and looking after the family
3276265 a really naive simple guy who doesnt know the first thing about jihad and was just tagging along for the job
3276266 there is a low wrapped around us for the next few days
3276267 quite clearly we are living in a time of change
3276268 we couldnt wait to get this started were sick of practice
3276269 oficjalnie msz rosji o wiadczy o w poniedzia ek e nie chce zmiany rz du w tbilisi jednak jego rzecznik prasowy borys ma achow zauwa y i los saakaszwilego znajduje si w r kach jego narodu
3276270 fallait pas la laisser tu vois elle fait rien que des betises des betises quand on est pas
3276271 frankly speaking the way its dropping i think 800 will be taken out very soon just look at the rise in the dollar and plunge in the euro golds decline is quite justifiable
3276272 gold has broken the chart points and everybody is rushing to sell their gold it seems to be very bad we are waiting for gold to hit 800
3276273 with everything falling i guess platinum will follow suit i am currently looking at the 1 400 levels for support
3276274 zijn dochtertje was op de bewuste dag samen met de babysitter in brussel
3276275 weve got a desirable community people want to live here and raise their families here
3276276 theres nobody today that cannot find sugar if they want it
3276277 kind of a slap in the face to american producers
3276278 times are so critical to us its a matter of survival
3276279 our bankers are getting to be very nervous about loaning us money to make ends meet
3276280 the last trip they did to norway they all played scandinavian songs
3276281 when they asked me what i wanted to do as a solo i thought im not scandinavian i dont know scandinavian music
3276282 im american and i live in south louisiana thats the music im going to bring
3276283 so there was like 15 of us in the audience
3276284 some students had put this together and they didnt know anything about getting publicity out but it was wonderful concerts
3276285 i kind of think if you ever wonder what you should be doing in life and whats going to make you the happiest remember when you were 5 years old and what you wanted to do the most
3276286 those are the things that are going to make you the happiest
3276287 when i was 5 i wanted to play the harp and i wanted to be a grandma i play the harp and i have three grandchildren that i absolutely love dearly
3276288 if they find a cheap harp on ebay it might be really lousy and a total waste of their money
3276289 ive had a couple of students who showed up with those harps
3276290 they spent 500 but the thing sounded like rubber bands on a frying pan it was untuneable and you couldnt do anything with it
3276291 he can back up any of the three positions so i consider jacob a starter as well
3276292 hes a great attitude and character guy and he has the talent to play all three positions
3276293 they just started having me play all three this camp
3276294 they call me the swing guy i play everything its a big adjustment but im handling it pretty well its like a whole new position its like going from safety to the defensive line so its a pretty big difference
3276295 mike or middle linebacker is the hardest position of the three i think
3276296 because youre in the middle so knowing it the others just feed off of it when im lined up on the outside ill think about what the mike has and ill just go off that itll come easier to me that way
3276297 the shoulders feeling great right now if it was a game situation i could have played in the spring but they held me out of spring to get to 100 percent thats where i am
3276298 i was kind of nicked up last year and now i have the three positions so im looking forward to this year
3276299 if i stay healthy i should play a lot this season
3276300 jason and i can keep the team together because we have more experience
3276301 but the younger guys know in order for us to be successful that theyre going to have to step up and make plays
3276302 i didnt get to play in the spring but i was getting excited just going to the scrimmages and watching the guys air it out
3276303 im glad we actually have a vertical game now were actually trying to throw it
3276304 in this last scrimmage i think tight ends caught six balls
3276305 thats unheard of since ive been here we should have a really good year as a group
3276306 i was happy to see them step up and address the team
3276307 we put a bunch of new stuff in today both on offense and defense it looked like a day where we went through the motions
3276308 i dont think they realized what happened until it was over
3276309 this is an opportunity for them to build and do new things i felt like it was an appropriate time to make this move
3276310 coach gave me my first opportunity to become a university administrator
3276311 he was one of my first mentors and taught me to be sensitive to students and their needs over his many years of service he has also mentored dozens of college administrators that are now serving on campuses across the state
3276312 many of the remarkable things he has done at the university have gone unnoticed but have had a lasting impact on many students faculty and staff
3276313 imagine what this could do for students in a classroom
3276314 instead of looking at the solar system in a book they can walk around inside of it
3276315 it would serve to better integrate the university into the daily life of acadiana
3276316 right now the pipeline of upcoming trained professionals isnt enough to meet demands
3276317 we need to do what we can to attract more students and diversify the education of the ones we have
3276318 we start with the kind of professional we want to create
3276319 then we work backwards crafting a program to meet those needs
3276320 the re education of professionals is just as important as the training of new ones if not more so
3276321 it gives someone in the workforce real options to continue their education that they wouldnt have if they had to come to campus to learn
3276322 todays professionals need to be prepared for the changes in their job and the market in general five years from now
3276323 if you want to see the future of business look to what the university is researching today
3276324 the university can be a leader in articulating the communitys economic future
3276325 a government of the people by the people and for the people
3276326 last year when the new high security prison built on the hills to the north of the town of suse was opened the old prison in the town centre was shut down and abandoned
3276327 weve right sized them and done a number of initiatives to make them more guest friendly and more right sized to the market place
3276328 it wasnt the layoffs it was the actual size of the floor being reduced in size
3276329 when you talk human resources obviously thats employees but it doesnt necessarily mean employees were cut
3276330 it could mean hours of operation might have changed the number of table games had changed
3276331 any time you reduce staff by nearly 100 youve let go obligations whether its vacation time or health benefits
3276332 there seems to be some evidence that perhaps the employees those who have been let go and those that currently work they may not have gained very much in benefits from this substantial increase

3276339 the best of the best were looking at an exceptional level of swimming
3276340 its moving because there is a greater opportunity to race and there is more money in the sport people are investing into thinking about swimming fast
3276341 the suits helps us feel good in the water if you feel good in the water you can do special things
3276342 a big part of sprinting is feel if you dont feel good in the water youre not going to swim well
3276343 where technology is used in sport it is important to be in control
3276344 im not refusing this technology we should control the conditions in which it is developed
3276345 people are faster now but everybody is in the suit so its across the board its not just a few people
3276346 if you look at the pool there is very little movement of the water
3276347 over the last four years ive never seen such a big amount of swimmers especially sprinters compete as much and as regularly against each other
3276348 what they propose is an obvious vestige of colonial thinking they must have clearly forgotten that
3276349 russian forces came to the central route and cut off connections between western and eastern georgia
3276350 russian and georgian forces must immediately cease hostilities throughout georgia and return to their aug 6 positions
3276351 the only viable long term solution is international mediation and peacekeeping
3276352 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3276353 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed 10 ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection

3276362 over the last four years ive never seen such a big amount of swimmers especially sprinters compete as much and as regularly against each other
3276363 thats a big part of why youve seen the depth grow and the times drop so steadily this group of guys has been swimming so fast for years they are pushing each other to go faster

3276369 marjory should go back to making tea for brian mulroney and stay out of serious peoples business

3276373 i think people will understand that my comments about marjory lebreton are a reference to a very partisan conservative who is looking for any opportunity whatsoever to get my goat
3276374 he told me to take a long walk off a short pier but it seems to me hes the one whos gone right off the deep end
3276375 we do a lot of work to get women involved in the political process and one of the things that keeps them out is disrespectful behaviour
3276376 whatever your party affiliation you shouldnt have to put up with sexist comments
3276377 we always hold the line that its very unfortunate that these kinds of comments are made
3276378 they dont reflect the hard work of all the members from all the different parties who contribute
3276379 if they sit there and say nothing that says a lot about them too
3276380 what are they going to say about one of their colleagues but they should take him to task
3276381 and women not just in the liberal caucus but women across the country should send a message to the liberals and send a message to stephane dion these sexist comments from mr thibault are one of the reasons that women are discouraged from going into politics
3276382 the greatest thing thats ever been organized in the history of the world
3276383 the really unfortunate thing is that description of the deaths by one canadian general as no unfortunate accident for canadians like myself who treasure this country care about s foreign defence policies mourn the unnecessary death of young soldiers this muffling of debate is extremely distressing

3276432 i am fighting for the publics right to know how their taxpayer dollars are spent

3276440 this wonderful scene starts out with a striptease given by a ridiculously fine looking european blonde slut that masturbates for us when two dudes come in and start taking turns licking her huge tits and tasty pussy while she jerks one guy off the other stands on the couch and shoves his cock down her throat while being fucked by one cock she continues to suck the other one she bends over on her knees so that she can be fucked in the asshole while sucking the other cock before switching it up so that the other guy has a chance to fuck her asshole she licks the ass juice off of the one guys cock next thing you know both guys are inside of her one in her asshole and the other in her pussy the situation ends with a dual facial from both sides

3276450 im disappointed that the prosecutors office felt it was necessary to bring charges that require a mandatory minimum 13 years on the three firearms charges in prison if convicted
3276451 i believe when this case is ultimately tried and all the facts are brought before the court no jury or judge would feel that any jail time is warranted in this case
3276452 at this point i think its her attorneys obligation to put forth any sort of mitigating evidence if they want us to consider it

3276487 the evidence that we have shows that your excessive consumption of alcohol was a contributing factor in the incident
3276488 when i read the cica letter i just had no words i could not take it in it felt like i was being punished for having the audacity to step up and say i dont think this should have happened to me it was like going back to the 70s saying she was asking for it how else could you read the letter but as saying its my fault i was raped
3276489 it is not our policy to reduce the level of award to a victim of rape due to alcohol consumption
3276490 if we play like we played this week we will beat australia
3276491 but it is going to take a lot to do it
3276492 the structure the players weve got the type of attack we have now the way we have gone about the game every single day the emotions the guys showed it is certainly not far away from a perfect start and the way i want to play the cricket in the future
3276493 i have certainly done some thinking about australia next year a lot more than i would have when i was a player
3276494 because you want to get the structure right so guys can play in certain positions feel comfortable know their role and deliver
3276495 it will be important over the next nine months to learn their roles and then deliver
3276496 my main driving force for this team is to be every single day up for the challenge of improving having no comfort zones and testing the guys out to perform every single day
3276497 im sure i will calm down and realise i finished fourth in an olympic final but at the moment its just so painful to look up at that scoreboard and be so close to gold
3276498 it went much better than monday i knew i had to go out much faster and one place i needed to improve was my turn and i think i did that
3276499 i didnt realise it was a personal best until i was crawling out of the water but fourth is painful to see
3276500 we were willing to try anything really wed both always wanted children
3276501 its overwhelming im still staring at her now thinking wow shes ours its actually happened for us
3276502 i hope that if anybody going through treatment sees us and sees evie it gives them one last little bit of hope to go for it
3276503 its been a real emotional rollercoaster theres been ups and downs but you get through it and to have evie now you forget what you went through it makes it all worthwhile
3276504 as always we will take advice from the home office and the foreign office we are not experts in law in every country so it is wise to speak with the people who are
3276505 it is quite a complex matter and cant just make a judgement on the spot but clearly we have a club owner who has not yet been found guilty of any offence it is an evolving situation and we will look at it
3276506 what has happened to me and my family and my close relations has resulted from efforts to get rid of me from politics
3276507 these are my political enemies they dont care about the rule of law facts or internationally recognised due process
3276508 house to house inquiries are continuing in the vicinity of the crime scene and the search of the scene is ongoing looking for possible weapons used in the attack
3276509 we are using chinese media outlets internet websites and community contacts to try and build up a lifestyle profile of the victims and identify the last sightings of the couple alive
3276510 i was really impressed with the way theo walcott finished the season
3276511 if people arent demanding hes in the england team theyre writing him off but i think hell develop into a world class player if people just give him some space to express himself
3276512 they are both great sides on their day but maybe they dont win enough games when they dont play well
3276513 bent only played at the end of last season but tottenham paid a lot of money to sign him and two years ago he was a very important player at charlton
3276514 baldini told me he played very well so we will have to wait and see
3276515 the most important games will be played on sunday so it is dangerous
3276516 we will try to keep as much of the original show as possible
3276517 voy a entrenarme duro para estar con esas fieras en 2012
3276518 en el futuro no me voy a contentar con un sexto s ptimo puesto

3276523 i loved it here i wished it would stay open
3276524 carl is like a brother to me we always stick together
3276525 he faxed us and said he felt his business was no longer viable
3276526 one of the points that has come across in my discussions with other european finance ministers is the widespread concern about the very high levels of profit taking and self reward that is taking place at the higher echelons of the private sector
3276527 the program was suspended as soon as the problem was discovered
3276528 we are in the midst of an investigation to find out what happened
3276529 was there something wrong with us medically are they under any obligation to tell us i would imagine they would be
3276530 the brachytherapy and warfarin dosage issues are unrelated and it is a coincidence that they were discovered within a short period of time
3276531 the routine in the u s is to assess the implant at three to four weeks out
3276532 the worst case scenario is that their prostate cancer wasnt adequately treated and it never went away or it came back
3276533 fortunately many of these men probably had low risk prostate cancer so hopefully they will be ok
3276534 warfarin dosing comparison of a pharmacogenetic algorithmic approach with the current empirical approach
3276535 if they didnt get irb approval and they didnt get consent from people and theyre taking the blood for research then its wrong on lots of levels
3276536 there was a little incident but it is an olympic games you are in a different world and people are going to do things differently
3276537 he had a pop at me before the last dive i saw my mum in the audience and i asked her to give me a call and tom went to me why are you on the phone were still in the competition and weve got another dive to do
3276538 thats just thomas hes over nervous thomas should not be worrying about what im doing but he was worrying about everyone and everything and that to me is really the sole reason why he didnt perform
3276539 we were out of character tom was nervous and thats what happens certainly not so much for me im a little bit older than tom so i can take things on the chin a bit easier
3276540 i really didnt know what to expect going up there
3276541 to get a medal in the olympics im overwhelmed im so pleased
3276542 ive got to thank my family they will be sat at home watching it on tv thank you so much for watching
3276543 its been an amazing experience i think the most emotional bit was when they played the national anthem
3276544 at the end of the race we were all on our feet even her granddad who was 80 a few weeks ago was dancing round the living room
3276545 i have got to get into the top three in the semi final this is the big one now
3276546 i still havent produced my full potential and i would be very disappointed if i dont make the semi finals
3276547 there were already indications of a major attack underway the interrogations of the people arrested in lahore gave us some pointers
3276548 it is possible that in al qaedas thinking this is just the time to strike hard and destabilize pakistan to remind people that blood on the streets is caused by a policy pushed by musharraf
3276549 una grave situaci n en las urgencias y en los hospitales as como el descontrol de las listas de espera
3276550 de hecho agreg el diputado socialista la comunitat dispone en estos momentos del mismo n mero de camas que hace diez a os
3276551 no podemos admitir que la ratio de camas por habitante sea casi la mitad que en el resto del estado y que tampoco se garanticen diez minutos como m nimo en las consultas para atender a cada paciente
3276552 hola para ir a mi sitio vayan a www asuli0 wordpress com
3276553 el punto que m s nos detuvo fue el de la nacionalidad porque hubo muchos debates y el tema de la reelecci n esta posici n en torno a la reelecci n se dej a la discreci n del presidente de la rep blica es decir que l planteara y esbozara su posici n al respecto
3276554 no s habr a que ver porque ustedes saben que l no fue reelecto habr a que ver qu plantea el actual texto constitucional pues acu rdate que l no fue reelecto
3276555 given that the nc is adamant to allowing us to have the defence ministry in a government led by us we talked with the cpn uml about ways to find solutions to this state of deadlock and we even urged the cpn uml to lead the government if they wish to
3276556 both the cpn m and nc have urged us to lead the next government but we are stressing forming a national consensus government incorporating at least four major parties
3276557 the terrorist attacks will definitely have a negative effect on tourism development in kuqa the county government will do its utmost to offset the effect and improve local tourism facilities
3276558 income from the tourism industry accounted for 8 to 9 percent of the countys gross domestic product gdp last year making it almost a pillar industry
3276559 federal police are scaling up their capacities in the fight against kidnappings with an unprecedented effort
3276560 were proposing a pact a national agreement that sets certain rules and commitments from each of the people involved
3276561 on the contrary the fight against organised crime has been reducing the financial and operative capacity
3276562 ik zou niet weten hoe we deden alles al folders uitdelen bordjes ophangen ze mondeling toelichten
3276563 sobre todo el de los derechos humanos son una percha que no desaprovechamos para llegar a los medios de comunicaci n y al gran p blico
3276564 el ciudadano no ha acabado participando porque est acostumbrado al coche pero tambi n porque para conseguirlo previamente se deber a mejorar mucho el transporte p blico
3276565 y si inciden en pautas de comportamiento pueden tener efectos sobre la econom a pero a largo plazo
3276566 es normal que la gente se sienta abrumada e impotente por las grandes cifras de violaciones de derechos humanos porque parece m s dif cil luchar para 11 millones de refugiados en el mundo que viven en condiciones lamentables que movilizar a la gente por casos concretos como las mujeres condenadas a lapidaci n en ir n
3276567 si pensamos en los hombres y mujeres de buena voluntad en los militantes de todas las causas justas esperamos acaso que se entreguen como voluntarios 10 veces al mes
3276568 de un ciudadano consciente que apoya el desarrollo y el cambio social en nuestro pobre y maltrecho mundo esperamos que se cuelgue en el pecho todas esas cintas de colores como las medallas de un general o que vista cien camisetas con nobles mensajes
3276569 tenemos que ir acostumbr ndonos a que nos recuerden que vivir significa preocuparse por los dem s desvivirse y pensar y comparar estos d as internacionales nos pueden llevar a tener una actitud participativa en lugar de ser espectadores
3276570 somos s lo una sociedad de consumidores de s bditos o queremos ser actores sociales para producir este cambio imprescindible
3276571 muy por debajo en la lista que las enfermedades de f cil prevenci n
3276572 a pesar de esto el pa s invert a m s fondos en hacer ruido el primero de diciembre d a dedicado al sida que en la comunicaci n sobre malaria diarrea o vacunaci n
3276573 lo que necesitamos son 365 d as de atenci n a los problemas
3276574 creen que hacer mucho ruido una vez al a o les confiere visibilidad los d as internacionales los ven como un asunto de visibilidad no de cambio social
3276575 de entrada me parece muy buena idea este tipo de fechas pero su multiplicaci n impide que la gente las recuerde y como todo lo que acaba siendo muy frecuente se deval a de alguna manera pierde el impacto
3276576 un pretexto para dar m s visibilidad p blica a los mensajes de cada d a aunque en ese d a no se tomen medidas contra el tr gico problema del campo de refugiados de darfur sud n pero no es suficiente recordarlo una vez al a o
3276577 parece que al establecer un d a mundial los problemas se resuelven no es malo que exista un d a para el medio ambiente el problema es c mo lo utilizan las empresas y las administraciones p blicas porque hacen un lavado de imagen y no se profundiza sobre las causas
3276578 los d as mundiales no deben ocultar que detr s de ellos hay movimientos ciudadanos que est n trabajando d a a d a generando unos valores como el cuidado del medio ambiente o la salud p blica contra el tabaco y que est n dando resultados
3276579 el cambio clim tico no es una nueva religi n es un problema una cuesti n sobre la que se discute y sobre la que se tiene que trabajar si hubiera una nueva religi n ser a la del consumo
3276580 muy necesarias ayudan a concienciarse a sensibilizarse en torno a los grandes problemas de la humanidad los que tienen que ver con el mundo de la pobreza el medio ambiente la paz la salud integral el fanatismo
3276581 que se fije en la mente de las gentes a trav s de esl ganes o a trav s de una pedagog a informativa es importante porque la sociedad actual es muy insensible est muy embotada por unos discursos por una publicidad de car cter muy consumista con unas fuertes connotaciones fr volas y eso perjudica sobremanera a la conciencia c vica y a la conciencia humanitaria
3276582 tiene su propio santoral endog mico y muy insensible a los problemas sociales y culturales
3276583 salen a la calle para reclamar la ense anza de la religi n cat lica y para protestar contra el matrimonio homosexual nunca he visto salir a los obispos y a las jerarqu as eclesi sticas a manifestarse contra la pobreza porque les preocupa la mayor a religiosa mantener su organizaci n sus reivindicaciones son el d a de la ayuda econ mica a la iglesia el d a del corpus christi el d a del nacimiento del se or y de la muerte de cristo pero sin ninguna traducci n social ni concienciaci n en torno a los grandes problemas de la humanidad
3276584 hes in a lot of pain i dont know how hes even walking with the amount of cancer he has in him
3276585 its going to be okay its going to be hard but you are stronger than you know you can do this now stop thinking about yourself go home and do what you need to do
3276586 he had two huge disk fragments from a ruptured disk which we were able to remove
3276587 hey bob you wanna go out and see if that dust cloud cleared
3276588 whats the point of having nkes if you cant use them
3276589 and finally new rule in two parts a you cant call yourself a think tank if all your ideas are stupid and b if youre someone from one of the think tanks that dreamed up the iraq war and who predicted that wed be greeted as liberators and that we wouldnt need a lot of troops and that iraqi oil would pay for the war that the wmds would be found that the looting wasnt problematic that the mission was accomplished that the insurgency was in its last throes that things would get better after the people voted after the government was formed after we got saddam after we got his kids after we got zarqawi the whole mess wouldnt turn into a civil war you have to stop making predictions
3276590 william kristol poo pooed the fears that sunnis and shiites would be at each others throats as the stuff of pop psychology right and having your head chopped off is just a quick way to drop eleven pounds kristol of course is revered by much of the right because he was dan quayles chief of staff and was known as quayles brain you know that which sounded impressive until i remembered dan quayle didnt have a brain and now mr kristol proposes immediate military action against iran predicting the iranians will thank us for it hey you know what nostradamus why dont you sit this one out
3276591 how difficult it is to be palestinian and how difficult it is for a palestinian to be a writer or a poet how can he achieve literary freedom in such slavish conditions and how can he preserve the literariness of literature in such brutal times
3276592 a land on the brink of dawn let us not quarrel about the number of those whove died here they lie together furnishing the grass for us that we should be reconciled
3276593 in 2002 bertelsmann admitted that they lied about their involvement with adolf hitler and the nazi party which included making profits from slave labour and publishing propaganda the revelations came to light during their takeover of us book publisher random house in 1998 bertelsmann used a revised account of their nazi past to smooth the deal
3276594 oh no books dirty liberal things joking sorry they dont teach you to read in alabama
3276595 socialism with another coat of paint lets see if the suckers keep buying it
3276596 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
3276597 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
3276598 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
3276599 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
3276600 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
3276601 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
3276602 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
3276603 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
3276604 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
3276605 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
3276606 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
3276607 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
3276608 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce

3276615 while the u s economy has avoided recession to date the major economies are experiencing a generalized slowdown
3276616 weaker demand in the major economies coupled with the need to contain inflationary pressures will dampen growth in the fast growing asia economies
3276617 when french and german leaders complained that the sprawling and unregulated tentacles of new finance posed huge risks to the global economy they were derided as sore losers
3276618 most challenging financial crisis in the entire post war period
3276619 the biggest financial crisis in the united states since the great depression
3276620 financialinnovation ought to be allowed to flourish but not without better checks and balances
3276621 otherwise we will be forever trapped in a framework where taxpayers are forced to bail out banks in bad times while wealthy shareholders reap huge profits in good times
3276622 people are now coming around to the fact that growth is slowing both in the u s and overseas so demand for commodities will decline
3276623 everybody is scrambling to get out of the ship before the guy next to them
3276624 its amazing how fast commodities have become the last place people want to have their money
3276625 it looks like the bulls have run out of ammo
3276626 with poor demand prospects ahead theres not a lot of reason to be buying commodities right now
3276627 i dont see them with their scorched fingers coming back into the market that money is gone for a while
3276628 but were not expecting that to happen for at least a few quarters

3276633 the province is very strict but i have no problems with that

3276637 in short i am convinced both by faith and experience that to maintain ones self on this earth is not a hardship but a pastime if we will live simply and wisely it is not necessary that a man should earn his living by the sweat of his brow unless he sweats easier than i do
3276638 poets are those who have made a profession and a lifestyle of being in touch with their bliss follow your bliss and dont be afraid and doors will open where you didnt know theyd be always go where you want to go where your body and soul want to go when you have the feeling then stay with it dont let anyone throw you off
3276639 when youre on a journey and the end keeps getting further and further away then you realize that the real end is the journey
3276640 because of the dogma of workerism unemployment is a problem rather than the boon to humanity that it should be
3276641 our houses are such unwieldy property that we are often imprisoned rather than housed in them most men appear never to have considered what a house is and are actually though needlessly poor all their lives because they think that they must have such a one as their neighbors have
3276642 most of the luxuries and many of the so called comforts of life are not only not indispensable but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind with respect to luxuries and comforts the wisest have ever lived a more simple and meagre life than the poor
3276643 a kind of second childhood falls on so many men they trade their violence for the promise of a small increase in life span in effect the head of the house becomes the youngest child i did not want to surrender fierceness for a small gain in yardage my wife married a man i saw no reason why she should inherit a baby and in my own life i am not willing to trade quality for quantity
3276644 the difference between a priest and a shaman is that a priest is a functionary and the shaman is someone who has had an experience
3276645 trust yourself to react appropriately when catastrophe happens failure of nerve is really failure to trust yourself
3276646 work for example is a far more actual source of misery for most of us than legislative politics

3276648 in proportion as he simplifies his life the laws of the universe will appear less complex and solitude will not be solitude nor poverty poverty nor weakness weakness
3276649 altough we all realize that monotony is boring almost every form of industrial work banking accounting mass producing service is monotonous and most people are paid for simply putting up with monotony
3276650 and what is the nature of a wasteland it is a land where everybody is living an inauthentic life doing as other people do doing as youre told with no courage for your own life to live an authentic life take your wisdom from your own experience because in thinking the majority is always wrong
3276651 all societies tremble when the scornful aristocracy of the tramps the inaccessibles the uniques the rulers over the ideal and the conquerors of the nothing resolutely advances
3276652 remember above all things that to write is not difficult not painful that it comes out of you with ease that you can whip up a little tale in no time that when you are sincere about it that when you want to impress a truth it is not difficult not painful but easy graceful full of smooth power as if you were a writing machine with a store of literature that is boundless enormous endless rich for it is true this is so do not forget it in your gloomier moments make your stuff warm drive it home american wise dont mind critics dont mind the stuffy academic theses of scholars they dont know what they are talking about theyre way off the track theyre cold youre warm youre red hot you can write all day you know what you know

3276662 it is perhaps still too early to conclude that ppi growth has peaked
3276663 the sharp acceleration in producer price inflation seen in recent months is a concern to policymakers as this poses a strong upside risk to cpi consumer price index growth
3276664 in the next few months the authorities will likely further tighten monetary policy and impose price curbs to deal with this inflation risk
3276665 since that original announcement the economics of the proposed purchase have changed primarily due to the surging value of the canadian dollar among other factors
3276666 this is an act of desperation what youre seeing today
3276667 the next logical question you ask yourself as an analyst is are they getting ready to this private
3276668 the actions that weve taken today are obviously to give us financial flexibility
3276669 suppliers in china are working on tighter credit restrictions as part of everything that were doing with our value enhancement plan thats why we are taking this action today

3276672 i think peoples expectations got too high because they began to believe that these prices couldnt drop and almost the beginning of bubble mentality had taken place over the last year or so
3276673 no one knows how far prices will drop but the fact the world economy is slowing is finally getting recognized in the marketplace
3276674 the drop in starts in july was likely slightly overstated with the weakness largely concentrated in ontario
3276675 however housing activity is definitely on a downward trend consistent with indications of deteriorating affordability through last year this factor is expected to keep new residential construction activity under pressure going forward our forecast assumes that starts will drop on average 5 3 per cent this year and 14 8 per cent next year
3276676 what with our daily newspapers and our telegraph facilities we need not delegate our powers
3276677 today under present conditions those statesmen and patriots would undoubtedly be of another
3276678 have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights they would at the same time be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions their opinions and their passions
3276679 would rely on a fair decision from three individuals if two had an interest opposed to the third
3276680 nor any further security against injustice be obtained than what may result from the difficulty of uniting the wills of a greater

3276682 as little agency as possible in the appointment of the members of the others
3276683 the power of preventing bad laws includes that of preventing good ones
3276684 would consider every institution calculated to restrain the excess of law making and to keep things in the same state in which they happen to be at any given period as more likely to do good than harm because it is favorable to greater stability in

3276721 other technologies that have passed the trigger where they start to be interesting to businesses include 3d printing surface computing augmented reality and mobile robots
3276722 we expect early adopters to start applying these in novel ways and driving new classes of application such as using 3d printers to dramatically change the supply chain by creating products and replacement parts at the point of need
3276723 in my six years of blogging there is one post that i started to write maybe up to ten times and each time i refrained from posting it maybe its time to get it out of my system its not even anything particularly interesting even though im sure some people might disagree

3276738 what do you want to get out of this meeting
3276739 lets take every stereotype of the different people who work in the hospital try to make it funny to prove a point and then show how much money we could be saving if only those stereotypical behaviors didnt exist
3276740 we saw it as a tool to help us with retention and recruitment
3276741 this definitely is something that has helped with our stature in the community and with our competitiveness
3276742 executives realize that if employees are stressed out financially have excess debt it really makes them less productive
3276743 theres a real financial benefit to the company a long term financial benefit for their employees to be on track for retirement and financially fit
3276744 is an obvious and predictable attempt to deflect attention from
3276745 we recognize market realities call for difficult decisions and resolve
3276746 we will continue to take the necessary actions that enable this company to compete in this environment and refuse to repeat the mistakes of the past when the interest of one stakeholder was put disproportionately above balancing the needs of our customers employees and shareholders to the harm of all

3276749 i have to set my mind on the phone to think about saving battery life
3276750 how a device performs in individual situations depends on circumstances like where you are in the 3g coverage how close you are to a cell site things like terrain and buildings all come into play
3276751 im not denying that people are having a less than satisfactory experience but overall the phone is doing great
3276752 once you have a fast connection you can do things you wouldnt have done on edge
3276753 the more activities you do the more drain on battery life
3276754 online fraud does not seem to be a top priority
3276755 a limited temporal gap between the time a misrepresentation is publicly revealed and the subsequent decline in stock value
3276756 the court recognized that investors respond to the impact of fraud on a companys bottom line
3276757 what we are seeing is a little bit of a shift away from pure cost shifts to employees
3276758 that kind of stuff is still happening but to a lesser extent
3276759 the fact were having this debate of who has to pay more because someone else is paying less is symptomatic of the many deep flaws in our health care finance system

3276763 paying more attention and letting these countries know we are paying attention is our main objective
3276764 people think its too flattering to me that alexei miller was kind of stalking me when i was in the region

3276766 the united states does not have a clear consistent strategy to promote our long term security interests or our near term energy and economic interests the russians do

3276778 the entire bay area is correcting for the frothiness in the markets that occurred from 2003 to 2006 where by all rational economic accounts the market was outpacing what youd normally expect to see
3276779 tend to be some of the nicer parts that have higher priced real estate southern marin county such as tiburon and sausalito many parts of san francisco county and places that have benefited from proximity to successful technology companies such as palo alto and cupertino
3276780 areas of overbuilding have very steep price declines but on the coast and in areas where there is still significant employment growth prices are holding up because demand is stronger
3276781 that shows you the roller coaster ride in san francisco and how now youre coming down to more historically normal levels
3276782 you can see how exuberant the san francisco area got over the past eight years and as the winds were taken out of the sails as the market peaked what that looked like it was a more gentle decline from 2005 to 2007 then more precipitous declines beginning in early 2007
3276783 signs of stabilizing market would be that year over year declines are coming down
3276784 were not seeing substantial declines in year over year depreciation
3276785 theres no bottom in sight for home prices at this point
3276786 were all looking for a turning point there are no signs of that at this point
3276787 anyone whos looking to buy should definitely be in the market
3276788 falling prices are the sources of all the credit problems the world is currently experiencing
3276789 the world is going through a real credit crunch all of this rests on u s home prices having precipitated this entire crash

3276791 if we play like we played this week we will beat australia
3276792 but it is going to take a lot to do it
3276793 the structure the players weve got the type of attack we have now the way we have gone about the game every single day the emotions the guys showed it is certainly not far away from a perfect start and the way i want to play the cricket in the future
3276794 i have certainly done some thinking about australia next year a lot more than i would have when i was a player
3276795 because you want to get the structure right so guys can play in certain positions feel comfortable know their role and deliver
3276796 it will be important over the next nine months to learn their roles and then deliver
3276797 my main driving force for this team is to be every single day up for the challenge of improving having no comfort zones and testing the guys out to perform every single day
3276798 im sure i will calm down and realise i finished fourth in an olympic final but at the moment its just so painful to look up at that scoreboard and be so close to gold
3276799 it went much better than monday i knew i had to go out much faster and one place i needed to improve was my turn and i think i did that
3276800 i didnt realise it was a personal best until i was crawling out of the water but fourth is painful to see
3276801 bent only played at the end of last season but tottenham paid a lot of money to sign him and two years ago he was a very important player at charlton
3276802 baldini told me he played very well so we will have to wait and see
3276803 the most important games will be played on sunday so it is dangerous
3276804 dia adalah tuhan seluruh langit dan bumi serta semua yang ada di antara keduanya maka sembahlah dia dan berteguh hatilah dalam beridat kepada nya adakah kamu mengetahui ada sesuatu yang sama dengan nya yang patut disembah
3276805 tiada sesuatupun yang serupa dengan nya dan dia lah yang maha mendengar lagi maha melihat
3276806 sebenarnya malaikat malaikat itu adalah hamba hamba yang dimuliakan tidak pernah mereka itu mendahului nya dengan perkataan dan mereka mengerjakan perintah perintah nya
3276807 dan malaikat malaikat yang disisi nya mereka tidak bersikap angkuh untuk beribadah kepada nyadan tiada pula merasa letih
3276808 sungguh kami telah mengutus rasul rasul kami dengan membawa bukti bukti yang nyata dan telah kami turunkan bersama mereka al kitab dan neraca keadilan agar manusia melaksanakan keadilan
3276809 dan kami telah memberikan kepadanya isa injil yang berisi petunjuk dan nur dan sebagai pembenar kitab yang sebelumnya yaitu taurat serta sebagai petunjuk dan pengajaran bagi orang orang yang bertaqwa
3276810 bulan ramadhan yang diturunkan padanya permulaan al quran sebagai petunjuk bagi umat manusia dan penjelasan penjelasan mengenai petunjuk itu dan pembeda antara yang haq dan yang batil
3276811 kami telah mengutus mereka sebagai rasul rasul pembawa berita genbira dan pemberi peringatan supaya tiada alasan bagi manusia membantah allah sesudah diutusnya rasul rasul itu dan allah maha perkasa lagi maha bijaksana
3276812 sesungguhnya kami telahmewahyukan kepadamu sebagaimana kami telah mewahyukan kepada nuh dan nabi nabi yang datang sesudahnya
3276813 adapun orang yang diberikan kitabnya dengan tangan kanannya maka dia akan diperiksa dengan pemeriksaan yang mudah dan dia akan kembali kepada kaumnya yang sama sama beriman dengan gembira adapun orang yang diberikan kitabnya dari belakang punggungnya maka dia akan berteriak celakalah aku dan dia akan masuk neraka yang menyala
3276814 apakah kamu tidak mengetahui bahwa allah mengetahui apa yang ada di langit dan di bumi sesungguhnya tu semua tertulis dalam sebuah kitab lauh mahfuzh sesungguhnya allah yang demikian itu amat mudah bagi allah
3276815 alah menciptakan segala sesuatu dan dia memelihara segala sesuatu hanya kepunyaan nyalah kunci kunci perbendaharaan langit dan bumi
3276816 i was really impressed with the way theo walcott finished the season
3276817 if people arent demanding hes in the england team theyre writing him off but i think hell develop into a world class player if people just give him some space to express himself
3276818 they are both great sides on their day but maybe they dont win enough games when they dont play well
3276819 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
3276820 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
3276821 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
3276822 as always we will take advice from the home office and the foreign office we are not experts in law in every country so it is wise to speak with the people who are
3276823 it is quite a complex matter and cant just make a judgement on the spot but clearly we have a club owner who has not yet been found guilty of any offence it is an evolving situation and we will look at it
3276824 what has happened to me and my family and my close relations has resulted from efforts to get rid of me from politics
3276825 these are my political enemies they dont care about the rule of law facts or internationally recognised due process

3276829 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
3276830 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
3276831 probably the biggest lie told in schools though is that the way to succeed is through following the rules
3276832 as a flexible and scalable lighting solution providing high luminous flux with no additional heatsink requirements the kit enables lighting designers to configure led placement for uniform illumination in any lighting application
3276833 the only way i could afford a car in those days was to buy an old one and restore it
3276834 we took more pictures of that car than we did of our children
3276835 the realism of the car is a very integral part of the play
3276836 tim hogan came to me to discuss the props we were going to use in ragtime usually we build our own but it would have taken more time and money than we had to do that it was just not possible we found an ad for a model t we called al and he was very interested he made us a deal to purchase the car and we convinced allan hancock college to put up the money it was a better deal than building it ourselves because we would probably be able to sell it for a comparable amount at the end of the run of ragtime so it was a no brainer als car gave us the realism we needed for the play it will be sent to auction at the end of the production
3276837 pcpa was the perfect match for us and the future of our car
3276838 as i was crouching over valenzuela he began to bite at my lower right leg
3276839 i felt his teeth graze up against my lower leg through my pant leg i immediately punched valenzuela in the head in an attempt to stop his biting at the same instance officer schwartz saw that valenzuela was attempting to bite me he kicked the subject in an attempt to stop him from biting me as i arose to my feet i could still see valenzuela attempting to bite me this time i kicked him in the head
3276840 i instinctively struck him in the face with my right fist to prevent him from spitting on me again as he was full of blood
3276841 they both unloaded on me and i started seeing stars and the whole thing was just bam bam bam after that
3276842 someone had a chokehold and they were all on top of me and i couldnt breathe and i thought i was going to die
3276843 i didnt know my teeth were broken until i was spitting out loose pieces
3276844 the thing that kind of made everybody gasp was when the officer took the back of the guys head and shoved it to the ground on his face
3276845 had i not been rolling the camera and no one else was rolling the camera it might have just been swept under the rug
3276846 was there a point at which somebody slammed his face into the ground
3276847 when you start seeing that the officers are making arguments that are directly contradicted by this videotape it raises questions about how believable the police officers are
3276848 i never saw the bicyclist make any sort of swing at either of the officers
3276849 the investigation is underway and no conclusions should be drawn until all of the facts are available and the totality of the circumstances can be considered
3276850 everyone in our country is initially entitled to a presumption of innocence even police officers
3276851 meet me on clubpenguin and i am cyrusgurl099 find me get excited
3276852 well actually brett youre here because after months of vacillating on your retirement and putting the packers through hell and forcing them into using a valuable draft pick on an extra quarterback because they didnt know whether youd be playing for them this season you tried to bully them into either making you the starter or trading you to a team of your choice like a prima donna you put your own desires ahead of the welfare of the organization to which you professed loyalty now youve been dumped on one of the nfls most desperate franchises because no one else wanted you
3276853 the jets became a viable franchise by signing favre made you finally notice and talk about them and care about them
3276854 this is bigger than when joe montana left the forty niners to go to kansas city in 1993
3276855 in the modern nfl the rules favor passing over defense so statistics alone cant tell the story put it this way favre has won three mvp awards but except maybe in 1995 he has never really been the best and not as good as many passers from the dead ball era like otto graham johnny unitas bart starr and roger staubach were in theirs
3276856 if you pitch in an all star game before me ill quit
3276857 ive got to see what he looks like i didnt want to put him in that situation but hes got to be considered ive got to do that ive got to go and get everything i can with the people that we have here
3276858 for the most part i go out and have good first innings and thats all theyre looking for is one inning hopefully it would be only 15 pitches three four times a week it wont be as bad for my shoulder as going out there and throwing 110 120 whatever they ask me to do ill do it
3276859 whatever jerry manuel and dan warthen want me to do get one out two outs go two innings start the eighth ninth
3276860 its still the same game of baseball its still three outs youve got a little bit better hitters and stuff like that but im still trying to get three outs the best way i can
3276861 as stupid as it sounds some days you get hits and some days you dont
3276862 its just a matter of going up there and having confidence even when you are struggling you have one good at bat and something clicks then you can rattle off a few more
3276863 its a good feeling but it wasnt at the right time
3276864 i cant fit both my motorcycles in the bed and close the tailgate
3276865 imagine taking that high tech form of lighting and making it bright enough and economical enough to light a room
3276866 while armstrong isnt developing the oled technology were providing a pathway for the rapid commercial adoption of the technology in the marketplace
3276867 if armstrong doesnt do this it could be just another neat technology that never makes its way to the shelf
3276868 for this property i needed to create something the buyer hasnt already seen
3276869 and were dealing with well traveled savvy people so everything here is custom designed and custom crafted from the furniture and fabrics to the special tile and stone treatments in the spa type baths and all of it reflects the sand and sea experience
3276870 ive assumed a certain quality level and our six person team has exceeded the standards that potential buyers already enjoy in their primary homes and vacation hotels
3276871 there must be pockets of residents that have some kind of a characteristic that is contributing to a higher infant mortality whether thats substance abuse or something else
3276872 i just cant tell you because we havent done that specific of an analysis
3276873 see if there is anything that might suggest an environmental exposure
3276874 the parents knew this was going to happen but said we want to get to know her before she goes
3276875 standing on the sidelines you just go i dont know if i would have the same toughness
3276876 even though many clinic patients dont have insurance we have pulled together community partnerships to make sure they get everything insured women would get
3276877 i can lock you up without evidence and you wont see a lawyer for two years
3276878 when i was in the math club we always used to say dont judge a geek by his glasses
3276879 i can lock you up without evidence and you wont see a lawyer for two years
3276880 when i was in the math club we always used to say dont judge a geek by his glasses
3276881 as the days got long there was always one thing that would brighten my day seeing the american flag
3276882 every morning it was raised and reminded me of what a great nation i come from i hope this flag also brings you and your class the joy and contentment it has brought me
3276883 i understand this is your birthday weve come to celebrate
3276884 how much different will things be for iraq as a result of today
3276885 will the insurgents have a less receptive hiding place will ieds become less frequent will the children of this town be more likely to have a future with less hatred
3276886 somewhere out there in that chaos of darkness and light of science and protons of gods and stars and death somewhere theres an answer
3276887 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3276888 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3276889 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3276890 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3276891 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3276892 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about
3276893 for those players who were here last year they have to take the right lessons the right perspective from last years team and put that into effect with this team as they rebuild a new team
3276894 it doesnt just pick up where you left off at last year
3276895 the guys that i had concerns about werent the guys going in for the first time it was the guys who had already been before they had to make sure they were mentally focused on the current enemy not the enemy they fought the last time they were there
3276896 i think there were some similarities with respect to the giants veterans that are returning youre not fighting the same battle its a whole different set of circumstances you are now the defending champions you have the high ground and everyone is trying to take it from you and its going to take a different effort than it did last year to become champions its going to take a greater effort
3276897 theyd be like i know whats going on ive got it youre not going to tell me something that i dont already know you have to recognize that you not only change with your experiences but so does the enemy and he continues to learn and adapt to what you do so the giants now have to understand that what was successful last year might not be successful this year because the situation has changed
3276898 the obvious analogy for guys and one of the things that i feel sometimes is and what seeps into my frustrations is your expectation level is so high but its going to take some time when you look at the mixture and the different people who are involved before the precision is as sharp as you want it to be i thought the message fit
3276899 i believe in the potential of people and i certainly believe they can do it
3276900 if these men come together as a team theres nothing they wont be able to accomplish its going to be hard people are going to get hurt theres going to be adversity and theyre going to have to overcome it im very optimistic but i know its going to be tough
3276901 my experiences as a part of the stony brook athletics family helped get me to where i am today
3276902 i feel extremely fortunate to be playing baseball as a professional athlete and feel strongly about supporting the growth of the stony brook baseball program
3276903 as much as joe was a talented collegiate athlete and a high achiever as a student more importantly he is a remarkable human being we are very proud of joe and are thrilled to name our baseball field in his honor
3276904 its been nice to get out of an organization where i felt like i was stuck for so long
3276905 it just felt like it was one thing after another
3276906 after the first injury it was kind of hard because id never dealt with injury before that so it was a learning experience but i think i benefited from it
3276907 it was just a matter of i was hurt and couldnt take advantage of it
3276908 no one would think he was going to throw 15 scoreless innings i dont think anybody wouldve envisioned that
3276909 but also in that same vein we knew he was a good pitcher and we expected him to pitch competitively and pitch well
3276910 with me its ok everybody out there was trying was trying to reel in and win
3276911 that was my main goal to go out there and have a short inning because i thought i was going back out
3276912 but at the time i didnt realize i was at 100 pitches and jerry just told me loud and clear thats it
3276913 i felt very good about pedro thats what we expect from him at this stage in his career
3276914 you cant expect him to go back out you cant play into the hand of give me one more because i dont have someone down there were not going to be successful in that manner
3276915 i didnt see his remarks i still havent seen his remarks we have more important things to worry about
3276916 i told him this isnt triple a it doesnt matter how much success you had in the minors this is the big leagues its tough he needs to figure out how to make the adjustments he doesnt throw 95 so hes going to have to be able to throw several different pitches behind in the count
3276917 i made the suggestion that he just wait until friday when we get home so hes in front of us
3276918 i think weve been saying this quite a few times this year theres some games that you have an opportunity to win that you have to make it happen you have to close it out you have to continue to add on we didnt do that today and we havent been able to do that consistently
3276919 we cant continue to perform this way late in games
3276920 we had the lead going into the last inning and i wanted to go out there and get the job done and protect that lead
3276921 thats the bottom line these games are going to come back and we are going to end up kicking ourselves weve got to win games like this
3276922 as tough as this is weve got to regroup refocus and not allow this to carry over
3276923 it went by real fast i remember when i was a rookie and everything is just a blur i could actually see what was going on defensively but just trying to recall the information and my responsibilities with each play it went by pretty fast
3276924 if you ask every guy what we see out of chad that ball comes out on time
3276925 receivers turn their heads and its almost hitting them in the face sometimes its amazing to see that on day one
3276926 he doesnt know any of us from the man on the moon now but he comes into the huddle and says give me your eyes just stuff a veteran with great leadership does
3276927 i dont care whos pitching i expect our guys to score as good as our hitters are
3276928 you always feel as though you should be able to score sometimes a guy shuts you down but weve got enough guys who can hit the ball that we should be able to score you get to a point where you get tired of always giving the pitcher credit
3276929 and obviously were not playing well and its something weve got to take care of quickly
3276930 i thought sidney pitched a heck of a game he got ground ball after ground ball he really made one mistake and it cost him the game
3276931 i have to get outs if i put zeroes on the board then were probably still playing right now but i didnt do that
3276932 ive never played with a quarterback who has a no look pass in his repertoire
3276933 there is no such thing as a decoy route not as long as you have brett back there
3276934 i tell the guys even when youre covered youre not really covered if you have two hands two arms youre not covered hes going to hit one of them as long as you can see him he can see you
3276935 some guys will drop back and they look one direction and the other half of the field you can pretty much write off
3276936 theyre not going to come back to that side with brett everybody has to play at all times you just dont know when suddenly your number is going to be called if you werent anticipating it you can end up with a wilson between the facemask or if its a defensive back it can be a 70 yard completion
3276937 he threw it and i was just able to get back and get a nice jump on it
3276938 i dont know how he slings the ball like he does
3276939 i spoke to laveranues right after we made the decision that we made
3276940 we have good honest conversations laveranues and chad were good friends each situation takes different people different amounts of time to work through its not a function of any sort of feeling toward brett hes been great in meetings and practices there has been no real change with any of that stuff
3276941 our approach as offensive linemen is the same no matter whos back there
3276942 in that sense nothings changed but what hes done on the field speaks for itself hes a valuable player an important part of the equation and well treat him that way
3276943 a process still needs to go on between brett and us because we still have to get to know the guy
3276944 were all anxious to get that started and move on
3276945 so we will never again be faced with the situation where one state fails to pass on information to another and a doctor who is not practising well or who is practising beyond his or her level of accreditation will be pulled up very very quickly and wont be able to be employed in another jurisdiction
3276946 before the end of the year queensland will introduce the first piece of legislation which all other states and territories will sign on to as the first step to establish a national registration scheme for doctors and other allied health professionals including nurses
3276947 so were getting to the sharp end of the development of the national registration system to be up and running by the middle of the 2010
3276948 it was agreed that queensland would be the host state which im particularly proud of
3276949 to spooks what torchwood is to doctor who ie not as good
3276950 every generation feels the generation coming after it is in some sort or crisis and seeks to help that upcoming generation find its way into adulthood in a way that was better than the way they did
3276951 the idea is to help our youth become more like us
3276952 its a great opportunity for us to award consumers who value our envelope
3276953 we are a company focused on communities assisting local advertisers in growing their businesses and helping consumers to save money on products and services they use
3276954 four years ago in athens i missed the semi final by one place
3276955 gone after the first day and that was absolutely devastating the reality is i very very nearly let the same thing happen again and i would have had no one to blame but myself
3276956 i didnt see the americans run so i honestly didnt know what would come of that appeal i went into the first run looking to play it a little safe and obviously played it too safe
3276957 after that i just had to give it a lash and i think i at least did that obviously i was lucky in the end especially with the american getting penalised the way he did
3276958 with only six being eliminated i think eoin underestimated a little how close it would be and that a good solid run would see him through
3276959 he very nearly hit the fourth gate on the first run but still didnt panic in the end it was a good old fashioned kick up the backside he knew two 86 second runs would have got him through
3276960 he made two mistakes but just about got away with it it wasnt about fitness and mental strength he just made those two technical mistakes and in this sport they can be very costly so he left himself in the lap of the gods
3276961 but then weve been hearing a lot that the chinese lucky number is eight he was wearing bib number eight his first run was 88 seconds and he was in 18th position so he definitely rode that luck in the second run
3276962 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3276963 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3276964 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
3276965 please make your way to the dining space im going to be serving dinner momentarily
3276966 we are stepping up and doing what we need to do to straighten this thing out
3276967 i think because of the ruud situation it was an opportunity to once and for all look for a fresh start
3276968 alexis been with us a long time im very appreciative of everything hes done for the galaxy that one is painful we havent made the playoffs for two years running and were headed for a third year you cant blame alexi entirely i do think we need a fresh start
3276969 this is a big loss for our defense because rashaad is not only a leader on the field but off the field as well
3276970 what this means is that almost every page is now a place for conversations
3276971 instead of just reading static product descriptions we encourage site visitors to create conversations with the commenting blog feature almost every page on the site is bloggable so our customers and partners can interact and contribute to the conversations regarding how our transformational legacy modernization tlm platform can help organizations overcome their legacy system headaches at lower cost and risk than any other approach
3276972 were now able to invite it managers and cios to plug in their metrics and get a more reasonable idea as to what theyre facing were confident that when they profile their system within the context of our tlm modernization platform theyll be pleasantly surprised at the result
3276973 as long as applications were made and approved in advance
3276974 we chinese people love the olympics and support the olympics and thats why there are no protesters
3276975 a year ago when we were given this opportunity i thought we had a major mountain to climb but with the huge support from the local community friends and the commitment from the parents with fund raising events all this would not have been possible
3276976 the whole experience was amazing they outshone themselves even in the rain i would like to express my appreciation to all the dancers that took part
3276977 i loved dancing in front of a big audience and seeing them clap i loved doing the street dance the most
3276978 after a year of preparation we had our once in a lifetime experience that nothing could beat
3276979 nope doesnt matter you need to give them more room
3276980 i dont want to send you home with a fine

3276994 yes we have no experience with athletes here but the treatment is safe and we can help you
3276995 it strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs it takes two weeks i recommend four intravenous injections 40 million stem cells or double that the more the better we also use human growth hormones but you have to be careful because they are on the doping list
3276996 i dont know how it was arranged or what level of hospital this was but it supports the idea that the world of athletics is very aware of gene doping and already pursuing it
3276997 there are interesting preliminary results but i cant expand on that
3276998 but were all encouraged by the results and wada very much wants to be ahead of the curve on this and has funded a dozen or more labs on gene doping
3276999 this is all very subjective but the hope is that it will be a fair process that will allow the athlete who has had gene therapy for legitimate reasons to state his or her purpose for it
3277000 the sporting authorities can then either accept or reject it
3277001 if gene doping is happening already as we suspect its being done unethically and with immature

3277013 section 377 of the ipc which criminalise men who have sex with men must go
3277014 i hope that the minister will now persuade his more medieval minded cabinet colleagues and make them understand that human rights are universal and one cannot be discriminated against for sexual orientation
3277015 in spite of section 377 homosexuals have continued to live love and have sex in india so it is really immaterial to the ipc act it has only stigmatised and made homosexuals more vulnerable thereby increasing their risks of contracting hiv which ultimately is a public health concern
3277016 it will help not only the homosexuals in india but also in several neighbouring countries where the practice is being considered as a crime

3277049 like nature abhors vacuum we abhor the political vacuum that exists in pakistan it greatly worries us
3277050 whether he is impeached or not is not important from the indian point of view it is for the people of pakistan to decide but it leaves a big vacuum and we are deeply concerned about this vacuum because it leaves the radical extremist outfits with freedom to do what they like not merely on pak afghan border but clearly our side of the border too
3277051 an attack on indian embassy in a foreign land clearly marked an entirely new stage in the levels of acrimony and violence

3277090 the us remains committed to a successful doha round however we continue to have deep concerns with proposals under consideration that would not only limit market opening by the worlds fastest growing economies but would actually raise new barriers to trade particularly against other developing countries

3277094 is everything alright theres been a few things ive been meaning to let go of tonight
3277095 everythings just fine so you can put an end to your worrying mind
3277096 would you like to go inside and forget the world and the rules by which we are to abide
3277097 id have to say its not a schedule that suits an olympics
3277098 if you play one match then have to play against a fresh player it doesnt seem logical
3277099 ive played in grand slams and olympics and ive never seen that happen before
3277100 marina still has to win her match so it may not be an issue
3277101 but if she does we will have a talk to them organisers and give our opinion probably nothing will happen
3277102 this taskforce will oversee and support the work to achieve that goal
3277103 the challenge is there it is there to be done but i dont think it can be done in a year or two
3277104 we might not have the biggest squad this season and we might not have the best squad in the premier league because there are some big clubs out there with big squads and a lot of quality players
3277105 but we can be the fittest team and that is what we have tried to do
3277106 i know a lot of other clubs have been interested in him hell be a terrific addition to the squad hes an exciting player and im sure our fans will enjoy watching him
3277107 the num is disappointed that a company that began its mining operations in 1932 still gives workers 1960 wages despite the high inflation
3277108 need to go 3 52 then 3 52 3 then higher
3277109 im thrilled to be part of the flyers family again
3277110 i want to make the fan know what the players are thinking and what the coach is saying in different situations its a new challenge and im really looking forward to it
3277111 i understand it was that way in the locker room when he played and you can see it in the way he interacts with the fans he has a personality that makes you feel comfortable
3277112 we both thought it was time to go in different directions
3277113 still be an active member of the flyers family in his role with the alumni and their functions
3277114 money is just an excuse to avoid thinking very much about the life you are living
3277115 i can put the great tradition in one word privilege

3277122 as part of a programme to enhance some of the catering facilities at reading borough councils arts and entertainment venues the biscuit tin caf within the museum of reading is due to have some minor improvements
3277123 the caf has been a popular fixture at the museum for a number of years and will be further improved to include extra seating and a new menu with extended food range offering baguettes wraps and sandwiches
3277124 new furniture and decoration of the area will also take place
3277125 at the moment the 3bs is open to the public for most of the day seven days a week
3277126 to make the best use of both the biscuit tin and the 3bs the councils intention to improve the biscuit tin would make it more suitable for lunchtime trade and museum visitors
3277127 from mid september the 3bs will be open to the public wednesday through to saturday evening offering live entertainment in the bigger venue
3277128 during the day the 3bs will be available for conferencing and functions
3277129 although the 3bs is very popular on some evenings of the week the rest of the time it is quite quiet
3277130 it got to the point where effectively it was being subsidised and we didnt feel it was right to be using public money to subsidise a bar
3277131 monday nights have always been regarded as the graveyard shift in pubs and most pubs arrange their staff and shifts according to their quiet times it might be monday or sunday or even wednesday wednesday is particularly quiet in reading
3277132 i shall be very sad to see the 3bs closed at lunchtimes i know lots of people who go there to meet when they go into town it is a very popular place to go for coffee mid morning too
3277133 we dont comment on rumour and speculation until an application has been submitted
3277134 the reason being is that we receive an enormous amount of enquiries about our interest in all sort of projects and sites and it is just not possible to source or provide a comment on the vast quantity of calls that we receive
3277135 we are always on the lookout for possible new sites and are often in negotiation for new sites that sometimes never materialise for this reason until an agreement is reached or an application made we would not confirm or deny
3277136 i do not want the character of the katesgrove area to change but independent shops are going
3277137 i used to use the post office in the area to renew my tv licence even though i couldve done it on the internet i wanted it to stay open but local businesses wont stay open if people dont use them
3277138 this has come as a tremendous shock mum has been in fairly good health but had recently been to her gp feeling unwell but to be rung up and told that she had collapsed and died was naturally a very big shock for everyone
3277139 make a film about the kind of people who never got on television
3277140 i am a very busy man i just havent got time for this there is no sign to say when you can and when you cant park there so what is going on
3277141 if there is nothing to indicate that you cant park there then surely you must be able to park
3277142 i think the council needs to sort this out people cant be wasting time challenging these parking tickets
3277143 they need to make it clear one way or the other about the parking here and put up the right sign and to tell their civil enforcement officers what the situation is
3277144 the council recently replaced the incorrect time plate with the correct one which stated no parking on the yellow line between 7am and 6pm on monday to saturday
3277145 however we understand mr chakal insists there was no sign in place at the time the ticket was issued
3277146 but ant what if i havent heard the reviews and randomly pick whatever theyre showing
3277147 advertising is the modern substitute for argument its function is to make the worse appear the better

3277150 negative attitudes about mental health problems make it very difficult for older people to talk about their feelings or to ask for help
3277151 it is scandalous that hundreds of thousands of older people may be denied treatment because depression is wrongly seen as a natural part of getting older
3277152 older people deserve better treatment there should be no excuse for inaction

3277157 but we speak wisdom among those that are perfect but not the wisdom of this world
3277158 as i said before the church having received this preaching and this faith although she is disseminated throughout the whole world yet guarded it as if she occupied but one house she likewise believes these things just as if she had but one soul and one and the same heart and harmoniously she proclaims them and teaches them and hands them down as if she possessed but one mouth for while the languages of the world are diverse nevertheless the authority of the tradition is one and the same
3277159 that is why it is surely necessary to avoid them heretics while cherishing with the utmost diligence the things pertaining to the church and to lay hold of the tradition of truth what if the apostles had not in fact left writings to us would it not be necessary to follow the order of tradition which was handed down to those to whom they entrusted the churches
3277160 it is possible then for everyone in every church who may wish to know the truth to contemplate the tradition of the apostles which has been made known throughout the whole world
3277161 but since it would be too long to enumerate in such a volume as this the successions of all the churches we shall confound all those who in whatever manner whether through self satisfaction or vainglory or through blindness and wicked opinion assemble other than where it is proper by pointing out here the successions of the bishops of the greatest and most ancient church known to all founded and organized at rome by the two most glorious apostles peter and paul that church which has the tradition and the faith which comes down to us after having been announced to men by the apostles
3277162 with this church because of its superior origin all churches must agree that is all the faithful in the whole world and it is in her that the faithful everywhere have maintained the apostolic tradition
3277163 wow i cant believe all the publicity kershaw and the dodgers are getting
3277164 the relationship between young men and the police in these hot areas is very difficult
3277165 beyond cottonwood you have four cable crossings all the way up to stein lake and some serious elevation changes

3277167 there could be wildlife problems they may encounter bad weather
3277168 its such open beautiful country you can get carried away in the moment
3277169 some people like to take the comforts of home other people are into roughing it
3277170 it would depend on what route theyre doing in any case they should always carry a topographical map with them
3277171 at a time when theyre in temporary crisis with their business we can help
3277172 we wont push them either way and we think the rose arts business is a great business
3277173 we have no home and no one is telling us anything

3277177 there have been reports now that theyre finding it further and further into the community
3277178 theres been a committee trying to get sunrise out of the neighbourhood for years
3277179 this report was fairly ugly and adds to the growing body of evidence pointing to the cooling in the canadian housing sector
3277180 construction is often a year or two years behind sales so the construction being reported now is a result of sales done a year or a year and a half ago
3277181 the united states has consistently supported btc because we believe in the projects ability to bolster global energy security

3277190 the petroleum markets are considering a swing back to the upside but seem to be having difficulty fighting off the ongoing flow of selling
3277191 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation

3277209 they dont know when or if to begin treatment if neurologists knew which patients were at high risk for rapid progression to ms they could treat them with disease modifying therapy that appears to be beneficial in early ms
3277210 remarkably 100 percent of the patients in subgroup 1 converted to ms within nine months
3277211 in contrast only 20 percent of patients from the other groups converted in the same period of time and even after 30 months only 50 percent of them converted
3277212 the fact that the gene is less active in these cells suggests that cis patients at high risk of conversion have impaired regulation of cd4 t cell quiescence possibly resulting in earlier activation of pathogenic cd4 t cells
3277213 were not sure if what were seeing is a cause or earlier molecular effect already going on in these patients regardless we believe tob1 is part of a signature that together with other cell cycle genes suggests a pathway for therapeutically targeting patients with cis
3277214 we now have a better idea of where these brain tumors come from and their relationship to normal stem cells in the brain
3277215 medulloblastoma was one of the first tumors that was believed to fit the hypothesis that tumors are caused by cancer stem cells that initiate malignancies and sustain them
3277216 but the prevailing hypothesis that medulloblastomas originate from non stem cells just did not make perfect sense with this
3277217 there must be susceptibility factors in the granule neuron precursor cell that predispose it to forming cancer so we now must try to understand what it is about this cell type that makes it susceptible to forming cancer in response to sonic hedgehog signaling this relationship between stem cells and oncogenes suggests a new point of potential therapeutic intervention
3277218 id be lying if i said it wasnt frustrating watching the nationals struggle this year
3277219 the shutouts are particularly tough high scoring shootouts can be stressful but theyre still thrilling shutouts are just draining

3277221 pitchers need to try to stay the same as close as possible no matter the score
3277222 i talk to them all the time about controlling what they can control umpires can squeeze you balls get lost in the sun lots of thing can happen
3277223 when youre in the lead youre probably more willing to throw the ball over the plate
3277224 these guys are trying to get hits every time theyre up its not for lack of trying sometimes the hits come in bunches
3277225 i dont have nothing to prove ive already done my job you can check my numbers with all the third baseman in baseball right now and you can see for yourself
3277226 i dont care what people say people talking about that can kiss my butt thats what i say people dont say that i was going to hit 20 home runs people didnt say kevin millar was going to hit 20 homers they didnt say aubrey huff was going to hit 300 what are they going to say now
3277227 its the same thing ive been doing from the beginning
3277228 the only thing is they havent been catching my ball thats it when i was hitting in the 090s i was doing the same thing when i hit 340 in 2004 i was doing the same thing i havent changed a thing i knew i could do better if my body feels good
3277229 i think its just feeling stronger and feeling a whole lot better coming back from those three days off

3277355 some of them are dead but they invited the other ones to go to the olympics but not me yes i am a bit upset about it
3277356 it hurts i think its something that no one should ever have to go through
3277357 but lifes not fair so its never going to be about that at the end of the day it happened and it seems that the sooner we can come to grips with that and process it the better off were going to be

3277371 these battleground states are good reflections of the nation as a whole
3277372 the youth vote both religious and non religious are likely to show the same patterns at the national level if they religious youth can have an impact nationally they will have an impact in the battleground states
3277373 the abandoning of politics as usual an opportunity for the underrepresented to have a voice
3277374 obama is the face of the christian youth generation moreso than anybody else
3277375 a vast majority of my friends believe mccain is the face of the christian youth vote today
3277376 upholds the christian values and he acknowledges that god should be kept in public places
3277377 young religious voters are looking for a president who will keep our nation safe while expanding economic opportunity and promoting our common values in this election young religious voters will see that john mccain has the leadership values and vision we need in our next president
3277378 our campaign is reaching out to young people of all faiths including evangelicals by holding house parties hosting events with key supporters and even holding rock concerts faith has been an important part of senator obamas life and he shares the commitment that millions of young evangelicals and people of all faith have to changing the world around them
3277379 a lot of people who will vote for mccain because of his view on israel and a lot of people will vote for obama because of his view of change and his objectivity to tackle foreign policy issues
3277380 because of the nature of the contest this time around both parties having highly contesting races
3277381 in touch with issues that matter to young people and he views them as beneficiaries to todays policies
3277382 what i am when i hear him is inspired and i dont get that from other politicians
3277383 mccain has a stronger allegiance and better stance on israel
3277384 there is more to electing the next president of the united states than being a good speaker
3277385 turnout is critical and the only votes that count are the votes that are cast
3277386 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
3277387 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
3277388 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
3277389 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
3277390 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
3277391 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
3277392 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
3277393 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
3277394 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
3277395 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that

3277406 theres no question that americans are desperately looking for change and new ways to conduct business in this country they want a new direction they want to know that their government has not forgotten them and their lives we felt that the democratic convention was a great way to kick off the momentum for change
3277407 anything you can do to change and modernize the convention is positive one of the biggest challenges is putting up something television will cover and people will want to watch
3277408 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3277409 we thought our climb was over but couldnt go down our ascent route
3277410 alpinism is not just death tragedy survival and heroism we hope our climb will serve as a reminder that mountaineers like us and many others climb mountains to live to enjoy to grow and to accept the verdicts of life and sometimes also of fate without arguing or lacking respect toward those who share the same value the value of life
3277411 this year a passing will be impossible for a small boat as you can see on the ice situation map end of july 2008
3277412 arctic ice has diminished but theres more ice in antarctica now truth is about 2 3rd of total north pole ice always melts by the end of the northern summer this summer it got down to about 1 4 of the winter amount it is much less alarming if you consider that the total between the 2 poles only represents about a 5 reduction from normal
3277413 this was such a road these were such gold splashed peaks
3277414 before john mccains tour of duty in vietnam he married carol shepp a model from philadelphia on his 23rd bombing mission over north vietnam in 1967 mccain was shot down and captured
3277415 left her 4 inches shorter and on crutches and she had gained a good deal of weight
3277416 in 1979 at a military reception in honolulu mccain met cindy hensley an attractive 25 year old woman from a very wealthy politically connected arizona family cindys father jim founded the hensley and company the nations third largest anheuser busch distributor
3277417 she was lovely intelligent and charming 17 years my junior but poised and confident i monopolized her attention the entire time taking care to prevent anyone else from intruding on our conversation when it came time to leave the party i persuaded her to join me for drinks at the royal hawaiian hotel by the evenings end i was in love
3277418 hillary clinton should take on obama in denver on the convention floor whats she got to lose nada
3277419 is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate
3277420 environmentalists will be forced to compromise next year and support the development of clean coal nuclear power and other alternative fuels
3277421 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3277422 a sudden feeling of fear or anxiety that comes on suddenly is overwhelming appears to be uncontrollable and may seem to be unfounded
3277423 im having a belvedere in your honour the mountains are fantastic fabulous colours in the high desert will say hi at pasquals for you
3277424 i know there is a little mini panic going on in the ranks of not a few democrats and the chattering classes but with o in hawaii the nation on vacation the tv full of the olympics phelps romping in the pool and georgia on my mind i just want to say hey its august chill
3277425 the unreal is the paris britney obama glam rock nonsense the latest example of which is
3277426 the more team mccain does this as much as it obviously gets their ya yas out the more they demean their candidate
3277427 this country faces immense issues and it is not a time for insipid parodies and you know what the american people understand it and they want more from the men who are asking for their vote to be president of the united states so the mccain frat boys can act out as much as they want
3277428 the unreal is thinking that obama has peaked in the high 40s in virtually all the polls but not understanding that it is mccain who may have peaked in the low 40s where he has been stuck in virtually all the polls
3277429 what is real is race the industrial states and commander in chief
3277430 this election brings us into new territory the country has never gone through this before
3277431 you ask americans where georgia is and they think it is somewhere near atlanta
3277432 so the handwringers are wailing that we are only slightly up in august but guess what we are up in august and we will still peak in late october
3277433 hey you got sms in australia we want to text you on the vp the moment barack makes his decision as we told our troops
3277434 thanks for giving me an excuse to sip the belvedere love taos and santa fe chill baby
3277435 it is our choices harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities
3277436 im thirsty can you point me to the soda pop aisle
3277437 people want choices people want the opportunity to make their own decisions
3277438 they come in and they look and they go were overwhelmed
3277439 since reagan the ideology in the united states has been that choice is good and more choice is better and to the extent that you can give people more choice in every area of life you are improving their well being
3277440 nobody has the time or the expertise to make informed choices about everything
3277441 when options are presented people have a tough time just ignoring them
3277442 its wonderful that we can sit down in our living room and order 20 000 things in a superficial way we are more informed than people used to be but its hard to get our attention and i dont see any way of turning that around
3277443 the era of choice the ability to choose and its transformation of contemporary life
3277444 follow me unless you have something more interesting going on
3277445 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together
3277446 we are fellow americans and that shared distinction means more to me than any other association
3277447 theres no way were going back to the times of zachary taylor
3277448 its not is too much information bad its how do you manage within an environment that does provide all information and will continue to provide all information
3277449 with more choices out there if leaders want to bring issues to the attention of the public they have to bring it into our venues and speak it on our terms
3277450 institutions are breaking down and there are going to be new ways of doing things but the cream can still rise the signal can still make it through the noise in this new environment
3277451 you dont need 90 percent of the public informed on the issue and following it closely to get your policy passed
3277452 not everybody was running around yelling yeah yeah liberty death
3277453 this country is an experiment and for it to have endured for this long it requires the involvement of citizens citizens making choices
3277454 where are those conversations we had like patrick henry on the steps
3277455 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3277456 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
3277457 americas three great national challenges our economy national security and climate change can all be addressed by switching to renewable energy
3277458 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together choosing the right path and repowering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3277459 we all know our country faces tough challenges a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3277460 we can switch to smarter cleaner forms of power and take advantage of free energy sources like the wind and sun the answer is simple power our country with 100 percent clean electricity within ten years
3277461 we are taking this message to a national audience because this goal is both ambitious and attainable
3277462 meeting the challenge to repower america will deliver the affordability stability and confidence our economy needs as well as a healthy environment and it will generate millions of good american jobs that cant be outsourced
3277463 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3277464 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3277465 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3277466 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3277467 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3277468 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3277469 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3277470 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3277471 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3277472 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3277473 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3277474 and the sad part is that it is keeping all of us from a having a real discussion on things that matter
3277475 as a black man in america i can never deny that race matters but i believe race is the red herring in this campaign folks have gone too far and are too sensitive
3277476 we should all agree that race is a part of this campaign once we acknowledge the elephant in the room perhaps we can start to figure out how to draw the line
3277477 could ralph naders entrance and exit have helped al gore the impact of decoy dynamics on consumer choice
3277478 we found that the entrance and exit of a third option the nader effect can profoundly impact consumers preference
3277479 the presence of the third alternative shifts the focus of the customer if you have two automobiles extolling their fuel efficiency while a third promotes style purchasers pay more attention to the fuel efficiency criterion then when one of the high fuel efficiency cars leaves the market the other fuel efficient car draws consumers in the case of automobiles it might be fuel efficiency and in the case of political candidates it might be health care when the third choice exits the remaining candidate with the most similar attributes becomes the favorite even if they werent before
3277480 we also call this effect the phantom decoy effect because like pre announced software that is never released these desirable options that become unavailable may never actually exist
3277481 the increase in affinity that a product may receive when a decoy option real or not is removed can mark a significant change in consumer choice
3277482 in terms of elections even a 5 percent increase in preference makes a huge difference at the ballot box
3277483 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3277484 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3277485 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3277486 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3277487 anyone whos paid attention knows that obama makes many more gaffes than mccain
3277488 historically presidential nominations were decided at the party conventions and as a result the vice presidential running mates were also selected at the conventions gallups jeff jones notes
3277489 that made it difficult to disentangle the effect of naming a vice presidential running mate on a candidates support from the
3277490 the small window of time after the announcement of a presidential candidates running mate but before the convention has taken place
3277491 similar to the pattern seen with clinton in 1996 support for gore held steady during bushs vice presidential selection phase at 41 percent
3277492 this will be a very interesting experiment that can never happen again
3277493 it doesnt matter if global warming is true or not we all want cleaner air
3277494 our actions over the coming few decades could create risks of major disruption to economic and social activity later in this century and in the next on a scale similar to those associated with the great wars and the economic depression of the first half of the 20th century
3277495 it doesnt matter if global warming is true or not we all want cleaner air
3277496 it doesnt matter if iraq had weapons of mass destruction saddam was a cruel and ruthless dictator who oppressed and murdered his people
3277497 once they are gone youll go back to sucking down the equivalent of a cigarette drag every time you breathe outdoors
3277498 it is all just mist does anybody think that china would ever consider cooking the books on aug 10 ap measured 604 micrograms m 3 the bbc measured 278 in another location and beijings air quality index which is supposed to be the highest of many different readings measured 82
3277499 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
3277500 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
3277501 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
3277502 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
3277503 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3277504 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3277505 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3277506 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3277507 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3277508 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3277509 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3277510 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3277511 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3277512 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3277513 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3277514 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3277515 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3277516 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3277517 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3277518 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3277519 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3277520 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3277521 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3277522 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3277523 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3277524 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3277525 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3277526 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3277527 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3277528 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
3277529 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
3277530 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
3277531 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
3277532 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
3277533 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
3277534 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3277535 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3277536 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3277537 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3277538 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3277539 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3277540 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3277541 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3277542 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3277543 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3277544 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3277545 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3277546 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3277547 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3277548 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3277549 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3277550 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3277551 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3277552 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3277553 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3277554 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
3277555 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
3277556 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
3277557 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
3277558 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
3277559 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
3277560 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3277561 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3277562 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3277563 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3277564 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3277565 just so you all know we did set a record
3277566 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3277567 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3277568 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3277569 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3277570 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3277571 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3277572 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3277573 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3277574 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3277575 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3277576 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3277577 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3277578 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3277579 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3277580 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3277581 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3277582 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3277583 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3277584 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3277585 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3277586 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3277587 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3277588 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3277589 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3277590 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3277591 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3277592 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3277593 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3277594 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3277595 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3277596 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3277597 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3277598 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3277599 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3277600 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3277601 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3277602 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3277603 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3277604 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3277605 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presence that draws you in
3277606 al gore is one of the few public figures challenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
3277607 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3277608 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
3277609 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3277610 theres no more important voter in this media market than the hispanic swing vote
3277611 i think people like me feel proud of being in a thinking process rather than just going with one party
3277612 i think it was one of those memos that was written looked at by the candidate and wisely discarded
3277613 i think its ugly and i think if hillary clinton had done that she would have permanently besmirched her reputation her legacy and her place in american politics
3277614 its interesting if somebody produces a memo that says we need to go after these invisibles lower income voters women blue collar voters and then produces a strategy that all through the summer and into the fall and almost up to iowa is cautious calculating triangulating and is basically a replica of president clintons 1996 reelection strategy when he had no competitive primaries i mean its undeniable that she ran on inevitability she ran as the candidate of the establishment she ran as a quasi incumbent in a year of change it was a terrible mistake so if mark penn understood what the targets were in march maybe they should have come up with a strategy that would have reached those targets
3277615 campaign it seems from these memos to have been at least as focused on the staff going after each other as they were on going after the nomination and getting past barack obama
3277616 by the way one thing we shouldnt ignore in all of this they can all stand around pointing fingers at each other theyre not pointing fingers at the one person who deserves the most blame for their defeat and that is barack obama
3277617 he was an extraordinary candidate who resonated with what america feels and felt and what democrats felt as he went through those primaries
3277618 theres a certain strength in the sense of centeredness and almost the serenity that the obama campaign has displayed
3277619 they have a strategy theyve executed it consistently they dont get thrown off by day to day polls i remember last september there were all these people who were saying obama is behind clinton hes got to go out and hes got to attack her hes got to run negative ads and some of his own people and fundraising people said that and he held a conference call and he said im not doing that i know what the strategy is i know what i want to say i know how to reach people now ill tell you something youre a lot better off in a campaign with a strategy consistently adhered to than with 20 people debating ten competing strategies moving day to day
3277620 i think its ugly and i think if hillary clinton had done that she would have permanently besmirched her reputation her legacy and her place in american politics
3277621 barry and his 300 advisors are no match for putin hed spin the junior senator like a top and play him like a fiddle
3277622 barack obama while on vacation still managed to handle the crisis between russia and georgia better than trigger happy mccain john mccain was ready to wage war with russia because he thought that they attacked atlanta if he had any soldiers in his army after his brilliant surge in iraq he could send them to fight russia
3277623 it took the race card to defeat the clintons and they resent the hell out of it
3277624 hillary fought a tough battle made mistakes that cost the nomination
3277625 it was written well before he went into politics and it was not ghost written
3277626 why are people still arguing about hillary and obama this entire election will boil down to one factor race like bob kerrey said if obama was a tall skinny white guy named paul jones the election is a different story
3277627 is there anything obama can learn from this story and these memos
3277628 its interesting if somebody produces a memo that says we need to go after these invisibles lower income voters women blue collar voters
3277629 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
3277630 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
3277631 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
3277632 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
3277633 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
3277634 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
3277635 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
3277636 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
3277637 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
3277638 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
3277639 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
3277640 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
3277641 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
3277642 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3277643 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3277644 a middle course between the republicans insistence on more drilling and democrats demands for more renewables and efficiency measures
3277645 educational levels tend to be higher among those who actually use the label yes
3277646 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
3277647 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
3277648 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
3277649 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
3277650 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3277651 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3277652 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3277653 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3277654 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3277655 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3277656 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3277657 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3277658 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3277659 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3277660 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3277661 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3277662 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3277663 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3277664 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3277665 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3277666 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3277667 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3277668 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3277669 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3277670 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
3277671 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
3277672 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
3277673 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
3277674 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
3277675 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3277676 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
3277677 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3277678 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
3277679 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
3277680 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3277681 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3277682 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3277683 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3277684 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3277685 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3277686 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3277687 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3277688 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3277689 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3277690 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3277691 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3277692 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3277693 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3277694 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3277695 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3277696 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3277697 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3277698 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3277699 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3277700 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3277701 die verletzung ist an einem teil des fu es der viel gewicht tr gt und die rzte haben gesagt dass ich gro e probleme bekommen k nnte wenn ich da auf den fu rasten zu viel druck aus be
3277702 ich habe schon viel mit ting gemacht er kennt den sport sehr gut und er hat das gef hl es w re riskant zu fahren er und andere spezialisten sagen wenn ich diese woche fahre dann w rde ich wohl den rest des jahres gegen die verletzung k mpfen m ssen
3277703 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
3277704 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
3277705 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
3277706 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
3277707 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
3277708 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
3277709 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
3277710 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
3277711 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
3277712 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
3277713 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
3277714 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3277715 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

3277719 for tennis players our main goal is the grand slams
3277720 the gymnasts for example their main thing is the olympics and they get one maybe two shots at it
3277721 bhp and rio have both been quite strong its mostly that move in bhp and rio thats pushed the market into positive territory today
3277722 bhp has also come off quite a lot in the last few days so a few people are trying to pick the bottom on it
3277723 esp rate tantito que voy por un cond n a la farmacia de la esquina
3277724 also mit so einer k ndigung kommen die nicht durch wenn ich mal ehrlich sagen soll was ich davon halte dann sage ich da die sich damit den allerwertesten abwischen k nnen
3277725 ja aber die werden mir doch das leben jetzt zur h lle machen

3277731 i couldnt see too far to the right coming home but i did my best anyway so it wouldnt have mattered
3277732 in financial year 2009 cochlear again anticipates double digit core earnings growth with a bias towards profit delivery in the second half
3277733 its certainly hard not to be spooked by the currency chief executive chris roberts said during a teleconference
3277734 its really hard to give guidance its better off not giving any guidance were trying to manage this business over the longer term
3277735 the result was on the back of record sales of the cochlear implant units improved margins and a disciplined approach to expenses
3277736 in mexico a very very important cochlear implant surgeon was killed in a plane crash and that impacted that program in mexico for example
3277737 it seems his issue of alcohol abuse is borne out of boredom
3277738 he spends most of his time in his house not doing anything
3277739 he is genuinely ashamed of his behaviour which resulted in a portion of miss allans nose actually being removed
3277740 what ive decided to do largely because of the length of time youve spent in a wheelchair is to avoid sending you to prison today on humanitarian grounds
3277741 a probation order will keep you under control and if you commit an offence while on probation then i dont think it requires much imagination whats going to happen to you
3277742 evidence of a possible break in was reported to the police on monday morning however the extent of the break in isnt clear nor is the reason behind it
3277743 although we are not directly involved we will continue to liaise with isle of man constabulary
3277744 the wreck of the solway harvester is still subject to an ongoing inquest and under the care of the coroner
3277745 any offences committed on the vessel will be thoroughly investigated and anyone convicted can expect to be severely dealt with by the courts
3277746 the most exciting scottish band in the last 20 years
3277747 ripping off fans through ticket touting is something we feel is extremely unfair and exploitative
3277748 excessive profiteering by touts prevents our real fans from being able to afford tickets due to overinflated prices which for us is the most frustrating part
3277749 its difficult when a band is starting out but we are looking into other ways of selling tickets and stopping the touts from getting hold of then in the first place
3277750 i tried to get tickets for the edinburgh gig but they had sold out in a couple of days i then found out that there are stacks of them for sale on ebay which really annoyed me
3277751 ive followed the band for the past couple of years and saw them play in half empty halls but now theyve got some success i just cant get a ticket for any of their shows
3277752 its not the bands fault but somebody is making an absolute fortune out of this tour and real fans like me now cant get in to see them
3277753 as a champion of consumer choice ebay believes that people with legitimate tickets have the right to resell them on the secondary market and both the government and office of fair trading have also recognised this as legitimate
3277754 we do however make it explicitly clear to anyone seeking to sell a ticket that they must specify the face value so that users are aware of the original purchase price before bidding
3277755 the most exciting scottish band in the last 20 years
3277756 i just hate to see anybody take the ball down the field and score
3277757 that match taught me a lot dealing with the media and the attention and pressure and what it stood for the symbolism of the womens movement
3277758 its a fun read it will take you an hour and half its quick
3277759 besides chapters on pressure is a privilege and champions adjust i talk about integrity and my heroes that were important in my childhood like my teachers rev bob richards and alice marble

3277761 vietnam was just cooling down watergate was heating up we had roe vs wade
3277762 we didnt even have fax machines yet or microwaves or cable television so you can imagine how much focus was on us

3277764 if anybody knew bobby riggs he didnt want to lose a bet
3277765 they e mailed me and said we are soliciting manuscripts no less than this amount or more than these words they asked me how do you get over a moment of depression not deep down depression but a moment of being out of sync
3277766 i was a child in a nazi termination camp i didnt have my dad with me because the nazis had picked him up in 1943 and brought him to god knows where
3277767 it doesnt take much if i see someone in a grocery store or in the streets theres nothing worse than mistreating a little kid if some mother wacks her child around me i just say to myself god lady you dont know what you are doing but those moments pass
3277768 i love lemon meringue pie i need to have the horse blinders on if i go anyplace that has it

3277802 it felt like someone had hit me in the chest with a really big hammer
3277803 when i came around the ia soldiers were returning fire on the enemy position
3277804 after the fire from the ia stopped i tried to move behind the cover of the wall but my legs were not working so well
3277805 we were able to get him behind the wall because of the fact that the ia soldiers continued to provide cover
3277806 once he was behind the wall it was obvious that he was a little out of it but at the same time we were able to tell that at least the plate stopped the bullet
3277807 i was relieved to see that his only injury was a concussion
3277808 the iotv esapi plate prevented him from sustaining any other injuries
3277809 my opinion is that it iotv works great whatever company designed and manufactured it did their job
3277810 we raided the different homes to find caches and to find people on the iraqi armys high value target list
3277811 it shows the insurgents that we are in charge not them
3277812 the purpose of the operation was to act on some intelligence that the ia had received
3277813 it also let people in the area know that the iraqi security forces are competent and able to secure the area
3277814 we did a joint intelligence briefing with the ia where the iraqi intelligence officer and u s army intelligence officer consolidated information on possible targets and insurgent activity in the area
3277815 the ia then came up with a plan of execution on how they wanted to cordon off and search the area for the personnel who were on the wanted list
3277816 by us watching in an over watch position while they execute it does give them a little bit of extra backing
3277817 if they go out and do these missions themselves the people of iraq see that their army is capable and competent and it gives the people self pride
3277818 they couldnt have been normal because he killed her and then killed himself but nobody knows what goes on behind doors

3277820 its something were all having to deal with and its harder because we dont know why
3277821 when we are bereaved we experience divisions within our selves as the webs of our lives are torn asunder
3277822 we experience ourselves as suspended between a reality where we are at home and knew how to be ourselves and a reality transformed by loss when we have yet to find our way the yearning and searching associated with bereavement are our responses to the loose ends of caring unachored when once there was an object to care they are responses to raptures in our personal integrity

3277841 de pot van 120 000 euro is op we hebben dit jaar al 120 mensen 1 000 euro gegeven
3277842 tot in 2006 bedroeg de subsidie 625 euro maar omdat we een stevige impuls wilden geven hebben we dat bedrag in 2007 opgetrokken tot 1000 euro
3277843 de effecten waren meteen voelbaar steeds meer hasselaren hebben ge nvesteerd in groene energie maar voor de stadskas zijn er grenzen ook de provincie heeft trouwens haar subsidies om dezelfde reden al eerder dit jaar moeten stoppen
3277844 ik denk dat het niet onze taak is om kortingen te geven op marktprijzen maar wel om de mensen te sensibiliseren en daarin zijn we aardig gelukt
3277845 in hasselt liggen meer dan 200 zonnedaken en zelf nemen we heel wat initiatieven op het vlak van hernieuwbare energie in onze eigen gebouwen trouwens we hebben ons oor te luisteren gelegd bij een aantal leveranciers en die zeggen ons allemaal dat de prijzen voor deze installaties aan het dalen zijn
3277846 voor het subsidiereglement van 2009 gaan we op zoek naar nieuwe accenten die we in ons beleid kunnen leggen zon voorbeeld is zeker isolatie daar doen we op dit moment niks voor terwijl ook dat absoluut ook een groene maatregel is bovendien zegt niemand dat we geen subsidies voor hernieuwbare energie meer gaan geven maar dat bedrag zal een stuk lager liggen

3277884 we had heard about captive from other credit union marketers that had either switched from another system to captive or installed the codigo application after reviewing several options
3277885 they reported a very positive experience and i have to echo those comments we have had a productive relationship with captive since installing the first unit in october of last year that experience prompted us to switch more of our branches to captive and we anticipate installing their system in new branch builds over the coming years
3277886 i absolutely recommend captive to other credit unions looking for a digital merchandising system this product is flexible progressive and easy to use
3277887 it is great to see a customer make use of several different display technologies to capitalize on the unique one to one marketing opportunity each area of the branch offers

3277963 with the recent advances in technology a website is essentially a mini television channel
3277964 and can be programmed with high quality video what was a non linear medium only a few years ago is now a linear medium and can be used to tell a story with a beginning middle and end in a concise and informative 2 3 minute video a spa can tell prospective guests what makes it special and differentiate itself from the rest of the marketplace
3277965 that can be sent out and received almost instantaneously not only does it have more impact than a paper brochure but it can be more cost effective as it eliminates printing and mailing costs and is better for the environment because it reduces the use of paper
3277966 my companys mantra is that in todays competitive marketplace if you dont tell your story in a clear consistent and compelling voice you risk being drowned out by those who do
3277967 and what better way to tell your story than through a compelling video presentation it truly is the next best thing to being there
3277968 the conservatorys new mission and strategic direction reaffirms our commitment to skills based arts instruction and helps us better respond to students interests needs and abilities whether you are taking a performing arts class for the first time or have had years of experience the conservatory has a program thats right for you

3277970 tax and spending issues are typically one of the main focuses of these measures but this time thats less true
3277971 the law has wreaked havoc on same sex couples lives because too many employers hospitals and others throughout the state do not recognize a civil union as marriage
3277972 they dont believe the legislature intended it to be equal
3277973 ik veroordeel u namens de rechters die hier bijeen zijn tot een onvoorwaardelijke gevangenisstraf van 5 jaar en 4 maanden met aftrek van voorarrest als u niet akkoord gaat met deze straf kunt u in hoger beroep gaan overlegt u dat met uw advocaat voor u een besluit maakt
3277974 before cdars there were few ways investors could enjoy full fdic insurance on certificates of deposit over the 100 000 limitation other than keeping accounts at multiple financial institutions or spreading deposits at one bank among different owners and different types of accounts
3277975 i looked at audience size and the cost to put on the concerts at meyerhoff versus what we brought in
3277976 but a program we did with jazz clarinetist paquito drivera did well in baltimore not at strathmore
3277977 a few people said it was a shame we didnt have the outdoor food and entertainment at meyerhoff we might reinstate that but there was very little money coming in from that in past years
3277978 m s eit esam lai nodro in tu mieru saviem pilso iem jo pirms neilga laika gruzijas eso vald ba tos apdraud ja
3277979 it was nice to know you but i gotta move on
3277980 you should have known i could never settle down with you
3277981 ill see you in atlanta when im bouncing through i got 24 hours for you
3277982 we are very pleased that the peace corps has acknowledged that it cannot legally terminate volunteers automatically merely because they test positive for hiv
3277983 but actions speak louder than words so were going to be keeping a close eye on the agency to make sure it lives up to its promises
3277984 while im still disappointed that i didnt get to finish the projects i started in the ukraine getting the peace corps to acknowledge that volunteers with hiv shouldnt be discriminated against has helped to remind me why i chose to volunteer in the first place
3277985 things certainly didnt turn out the way i thought they would when i signed up but at least i was able to do some good for future volunteers with hiv
3277986 massachusetts is taking down the do not enter sign that applied only to same sex couples
3277987 a wonderful new opportunity has opened up for same sex couples in new york where marriages from other jurisdictions are widely respected under state law
3277988 but all same sex couples should be allowed to marry in their home state just as other couples do lambda legal is working to uphold our trial court victory in iowa where the court ruled that excluding same sex couples from marriage is unconstitutional and we join our colleagues at glad in hoping for a favorable ruling from the state supreme court in connecticut in the case they brought there
3277989 lgbt anglicans are back on the chopping block based on the work of the windsor continuation group
3277990 we applaud the strong testimony in todays hearings from tec bishops who are committed to be pastoral to all the sheep in their flock not just the straight ones
3277991 it is a sad thing indeed that the message todays report sends out from the anglican communion to the world is that homosexuals getting married in california are of more concern to the church than are homosexuals being mugged in nigeria
3277992 as integrity continues to offer our witness here at lambeth conference we demonstrate our deep commitment to our ongoing relationship with the rest of the global anglican communion at the same time we will witness to our conviction that the vocations and relationships of the lgbt baptized are not for sale as bargaining chips in this game of global anglican politics at the end of the day too high a price to pay for institutional unity
3277993 i cant tell you how happy i am that the judge agreed we have a right to create a safe space for gay students at my school
3277994 all weve ever wanted was to have a club to talk about tolerance and harassment so we can try to make our school a better place for all students
3277995 all the rights and privileges granted to other noncurricular groups
3277996 judge moores ruling that gsas are beneficial to gay students and that they dont harm straight students is unparalleled this is a clear victory for the students for the okeechobee gsa and indeed for all high school students in florida
3277997 these are brave students who would not be silenced and did not tolerate discrimination so many children cannot stand up for themselves but hopefully this ruling will serve as warning to other florida schools that equal access truly means equal access and schools that choose not to follow the law will be inviting similar litigation
3277998 shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate
3277999 the desire of the gsa to meet as a group to discuss matters pertinent to the challenges presented by their non heterosexual identity and to build understanding and trust with other heterosexual students sounds in the political speech addressed in tinker
3278000 that the gsas tolerance based message would not materially or substantially interfere with discipline in the operation of the school in order for the school board to justify its refusals to recognize the gsa as a student organization it must be able to show that its action was caused by something more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint this is precisely what the school board has failed to do
3278001 it has been a long road and we are very pleased with the outcome now the students at okeechobee high school can start the new school year with a clean slate and openly discuss the problems they face with fellow classmates
3278002 the united states has finally ended the practice of mandating discrimination against hiv positive people by removing the statutory ban on entry for hiv positive foreign nationals congress has sent a clear signal that we cant fight discrimination and stigma abroad until we end them at home congress has done its part now its time for hhs to act
3278003 with the statutory ban no longer in place we can now begin to frame a fair and sensible hiv immigration policy
3278004 the department of health and human services should act swiftly to remove hiv from its list it is time to leave behind this vestige of the fear and ignorance about aids that gripped the united states in the late 1980s today everyone knows that you cant get aids from sitting next to someone on an airplane or sharing a bathroom american policy should reflect this
3278005 today president bush signed the pepfar reauthorization bill into law not only does this represent a profound commitment to fighting the aids epidemic globally but it also finally eliminates the discriminatory travel and immigration ban on individuals with hiv i am proud to have sponsored this initiative and to have worked with so many superb organizations like immigration equality on its passage
3278006 its already bad enough that youre part of a community thats been scrutinized and judged and because society has become more accepting of gay people weve created new divisions among us
3278007 im attracted to gay bisexual and straight men equally but i think its a matter of finding someone who will respect me as i am and be willing to grow
3278008 there are very few gay men that are open to dating or i would even say being intimate with someone who is transgender
3278009 the verbiage is really just amazing it makes me feel bad
3278010 if i was to compliment someone or even tell them i think theyre attractive or ask them if they want to converse theyll tell me youre nasty or if i wanted a woman i will go get with one
3278011 a group of black lesbians who decided to gang assault
3278012 it is inescapable that five percent of the registered voters in montgomery county was not 25 001 it was 27 615 plainly mcrg did not gather enough signatures to meet the five percent threshold plaintiffs however judicially challenged the denominator too late
3278013 the referendum is a drastic measure to block a law that was unanimously passed by the duly elected montgomery county council after extensive public hearings
3278014 the court agreed with our arguments but said we didnt make them soon enough we disagree and will be seeking an appeal
3278015 strict compliance is supposed to provide safeguards for the vulnerable minority that the law is intended to protect and this ruling disregards those safeguards
3278016 we are working with our attorneys to assess where we go from here in the meantime basic rights montgomery a broad based coalition working to ensure this law remains in place is in full swing
3278017 cannot and should not legislate against correct reasoning because if they pass the law it would loose moral force
3278018 laws favorable to homosexual unions are contrary to correct reasoning because they confer legal guarantees proper to the institution of marriage to unions between people of the same sex considering the values in question the state cannot legalize these unions without failing in its duty to promote and protect an essential institution for the common good which marriage is
3278019 when i was in college i was chapter 9 in abnormal psych to be able to marry the woman i loved at the age of 58 my feet didnt touch the ground for days

3278058 being able to find the books i need at a lower price was easy at freestudentlistings com and i met the seller right at school to pick up my books
3278059 the concept of freestudentlistings com is simply to help students save money when they need it most
3278060 another reason why this concept allows students to save more money on their textbooks is because freestudentlistings com is independent of wholesalers campus bookstores can only sell what the wholesalers tell them to sell if a publisher puts out a new edition the campus bookstore can no longer sell the older editions however freestudentlistings com allows any edition to be posted and sold on their website this allows students to speak with their professors to see if they will accept the old editions if the professor says yes the student can save money by purchasing an older book

3278094 i played really clean matches in the past and the next one would be kind of streaky i dont want to do that any more
3278095 we shall defend our office wear whatever the cost may be we shall fight on the pavements we shall fight at the checkouts we shall fight in the aisles and in the streets we shall fight for the credit cards we shall never surrender
3278096 but we really didnt know the extent of the issue
3278097 i personally didnt think thered be that many im quite surprised
3278098 theres a lot of construction and renovation waste as well as furniture and appliances
3278099 people have spring and fall cleanup so theres no excuse
3278100 were going to have a chemist come to assess the site before we clean it up and after we clean it up
3278101 but a number of auto salvage yards will come and pick up the derelict vehicle for free because of the price of scrap so really theres no reason for it
3278102 thats what we like when we find people smiling and happy
3278103 most times we head out hoping to find someone alive
3278104 but sometimes we have to go out knowing were going to find a body and that makes it hard
3278105 completely demolish two buildings and to mostly demolish three other buildings in the central block of historic properties
3278106 armour proposes to construct a nine storey modernistic building attached to remnants of the existing buildings
3278107 they are intended to be a headline grabbing reference to demolition of heritage buildings which will result in a substantial number of e mails and phone calls to members of council
3278108 the misinformation has been presented by members of the heritage trust of nova scotia to the residents so as to entice their signature the purposeful sensationalism of the petition presented and the statements of mr phil pacey to the media are an unprofessional way for the heritage trust of nova scotia to conduct itself
3278109 it is an obsolete wood framed building that cannot be viably incorporated into the redevelopment
3278110 were doing the best we can to avoid having boarded up buildings or a parking lot
3278111 were just trying to bring our heritage past into a modern urban core with sustainable economic development
3278112 halifax is a port city and we need to entertain our guests
3278113 no wonder there arent any americans coming here anymore why should they theres nothing here for them we only have one strip club and its not even in halifax its out in the outskirts of dartmouth so we shouldnt even expect tourists to come here
3278114 i have to put up the money first instead of just hoping it will fall from the sky if i cant reach my financial goals then im not going to run
3278115 we need to protect our public transit drivers taxi cab and school bus and city transport drivers by making stiffer sentences for attacks on them and give them more power to act in self defence
3278116 people are looking for a change theyre looking for something and sometimes you need a little spark to get people to pay attention
3278117 i know hes been involved in politics for some time
3278118 hell bring his issues and platform forward and the public will choose whom they wish to have in place
3278119 as a result of the process with the mayors roundtable on violence some of the issues being promoted would certainly take us back many steps and they certainly wouldnt be ones i would be promoting
3278120 the heat and humidity over here is not what theyre set up for
3278121 its just the nature of doing business especially in this environment
3278122 nothings made to fly in the sand and dirt and the temperatures that were flying in
3278123 i was drinking between four and five gallons of water and gatorade a day
3278124 i know it sounds unreal but thats what it was i couldnt believe it either its constant sweat
3278125 id get up around 6 a m and go upstairs
3278126 as soon as you open a door to go outside its just like hitting a wall its just like an oven the humidity is unreal that early in the morning
3278127 its about 50 feet long the hangar and the helicopter is about 48 feet long weve got about two feet on either side of the helicopter between the stack and the helicopter so it takes some manoeuvring its a tight fit
3278128 we kind of communicate with the guy driving the ship to make sure he gives us as steady a course as possible
3278129 we get it done as quickly as possible the big thing is taking care of the helicopter and not causing any secondary damage were limited in our resources so if we break something weve got to make sure that we can fix it
3278130 ive got to make sure its done safely because its not only my friends lives that are at risk its myself
3278131 the flight was awesome weve had no problems with the engines since
3278132 so if there is an off chance that we have to change another engine then were prepared to do that
3278133 the people here theyre so friendly theyre just so hospitable
3278134 i think probably the influence of the people will stick with me the longest
3278135 the families were so incredible theyre so connected as families they eat together they do everything together
3278136 for the world to get a handle on whats happening to itself biologists and sociologists have to sort of come together
3278137 so basically on the street you wont see the commissionaires anymore youll see uniformed private personnel
3278138 its like taking control of my own personal information rather than having someone read it back to me
3278139 we want to make sure that especially people who have a history of violent offending or reoffending sexual offenders are properly monitored
3278140 the guy picked him up on wyse road and went to a couple of spots throughout the city and he was confronting him about an alleged relationship between him and a female
3278141 thats what we like when we find people smiling and happy
3278142 most times we head out hoping to find someone alive
3278143 but sometimes we have to go out knowing were going to find a body and that makes it hard
3278144 i loved it here i wished it would stay open
3278145 carl is like a brother to me we always stick together
3278146 he faxed us and said he felt his business was no longer viable
3278147 while there is a 100 percent rise in fertilizer prices and 30 percent in fuel oil prices the government should start to implement the marginal payment support system which was regulated for supply deficit products in the tobacco code and specifies the seed cotton premium at least ykr 50 for the 2007 product
3278148 the premium rate that will be specified will draw the road map of the future of turkeys cotton production whether the producers will keep sowing cotton or they will terminate plantation through decreasing the production rate with each passing year
3278149 cotton which is a vegetative raw material of textile has a considerable role in both turkeys and the worlds agricultural industry and trade
3278150 despite its strategic importance the cotton production rate unfortunately declines in turkey year by year there is a 20 percent decline in plantation area in 2007 to 2008 business year compared to the previous year and we expect the decline to continue this year as well
3278151 the deterioration in cotton production is a matter that concerns turkeys future
3278152 there will be no competitiveness in cotton production without more public support
3278153 it takes everybody living in and around a lake setting to make sure that their lake stays clean by not polluting
3278154 the quantum leap is that people believe automatically when theres fecal coliform in fresh water that there must have been some sort of sewage overflow
3278155 but we are very very firm in suggesting that lakes may be contaminated for various reasons at any time
3278156 with heavy rain each drop of rain that falls on buildings roads and driveways ends up through the storm water systems into our lakes
3278157 so what i believe were experiencing is a very natural spike in an urban area
3278158 dog and bird feces have been known to raise the fecal coliform level of the lakes substantially enough to have this kind of spike

3278352 here you are strung up like my little marionette no doubt feeling sorry for yourself
3278353 but good question the point sir is entertainment you can either entertain or be entertained and by trying to kill yourself you have unwittingly picked the former now where the hell is that light switch
3278354 fuck you man i tried to feel better but its not worth it always trying but never really succeeding if i cant be happy most of the time then why bother why why i am i trying to explain myself to you
3278355 well i suspect because you think that anyone understands and you see this as your last attempt to explain yourself before you die but boy howdy are you barking up the wrong tree
3278356 the words crashed into the man the truth of them was all at once disarming and debilitating
3278357 i bet you still havent figured out how i know you so well
3278358 whats worse is i already told you you just werent listening shows how dumb you are

3278374 this is much more serious than mid term blues which may be expected to evaporate as the general election approaches
3278375 first is the frantic search for some magic populist policy solution there is no single get out of jail card and it is foolish to believe that such simplistic solutions will do the trick indeed some are counter productive inviting the publics contempt by implying a desperation to buy support by ditching unpopular taxes or offering dubious incentives
3278376 dangling the carrot of home ownership in front of low income council tenants in current market conditions for example is a deeply suspect proposition
3278377 just as dubious is the siren call for more initiatives one of the greatest mistakes in government is to confuse activity with outcomes just because ministers feel busy devising 101 new ways of tackling a problem does not guarantee the problem gets solved

3278416 sometimes it will just be an absolute pounding headache otherwise its just like a dulling pain
3278417 weather changes so barometric pressure changes were getting lots of storms so the heat the humidity and then the rain that follows it are triggers of headaches

3278468 the leprechaun went missing many many months ago and i had forgotten about it then i opened the door and saw he was back
3278469 well its a bit of mischief but at least he hasnt been put through the window
3278470 murphy was quite badly damaged and there was a tightly wrapped parcel next to him my curiosity eventually overcame my alarm because i did wonder if it might explode then i saw it was a beautifully bound photo album and opened it up his feet were missing but thats no real surprise given that he was sent abseiling down a mountain
3278471 the story really is unbelievable people have mentioned to me how similar his adventure is to the film amelie so perhaps the people who took him got their inspiration from that
3278472 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
3278473 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient
3278474 its day to day right now its a little bit more in depth than youve been hearing about
3278475 i cant really explain it at this point because ive been researching it myself but i figure i might be all right
3278476 its just years of playing this game most tackles that ive made have been on my left side but im out here moving around and loosening it up its just being smart with it
3278477 im not doubtful of that at all based on what weve been told by the doctors
3278478 but i understand where as an athlete you want it to be right weve got plenty of experts working on it

3278481 when i used to play against him you just couldnt throw the ball in the middle of the field because he was always around it now that im playing with him its the same thing in practice
3278482 he is the best free safety in the game hands down theres nobody better than him nobody roams the field better than him nobody catches the ball better in that back end
3278483 i played quarterback in high school so if they need me to go over there with those guys i can
3278484 its something youre born with its just something you cant teach
3278485 everybody always tells me you better watch your back because ed will take your candy
3278486 hes everywhere ive always heard stories about how ed reed makes plays and now im out here witnessing it
3278487 he definitely helps me just as a man coach knows me ive been helping him understand the guys that we have and i think thats really good
3278488 having coached the secondary you have a good idea of the picture you look for back there
3278489 ed is good enough to change the picture just a little bit he doesnt have to be quite as deep or quite as wide as another guy to make plays over the years by baiting quarterbacks a little bit hes got a real knack for that
3278490 as we get older the quickness tends to slow down but i think im a lot better than i was at the beginning of my career mentally the quickness and everything is still up to par but ive still got a lot of work to do
3278491 thats the one thing i can say about this whole thing i dont regret anything that ever happened honestly i can say i would not do anything different
3278492 i love it down here i love all the guys i love the program i love all the coaches i couldnt be more happy
3278493 i dont think hes available or we can afford him so well have to skip that
3278494 weve tried to look at different ways to be more proactive better in our educational efforts im very confident this year will be different but only time will tell just like our results on the field
3278495 you can never tell a quarterback enough that the best decision sometimes is a ball thrown into the first row

3278555 in the space of a very short period of time all those planks have been pulled out from under the aussie
3278556 i think what the market is overpricing by a long shot here is the idea that the us economy will somehow outperform europe it wont

3278566 weve got two players that very much want to move into bankable feasibility studies immediately and weve been encouraged by that
3278567 energy will continue to be in high demand and if you look forward for 10 20 or 30 years there is going to be considerably more demand
3278568 worley is well placed to be participating in organising much of that
3278569 bhp and rio have both been quite strong its mostly that move in bhp and rio thats pushed the market into positive territory today
3278570 bhp has also come off quite a lot in the last few days so a few people are trying to pick the bottom on it
3278571 saya tanya tentang monorel apakah akan dilanjutkan atau dihentikan selama ini publik suka bertanya kepada kpk
3278572 it will help health planners tailor services to meet local needs
3278573 this data allows people to look at the health situation in their own county or in their own local government district
3278574 we are beginning to build a picture of health at the local level allowing people and planners to see how they compare with others in their jurisdiction and across the island
3278575 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3278576 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3278577 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3278578 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3278579 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3278580 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3278581 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3278582 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3278583 it is our firm resolve that we will root out terrorism from pakistan and all of our security agencies are working together to achieve this goal
3278584 we now have some distance from the indymac situation and people are starting to feel more confident about their deposits
3278585 net deposit outflows resume the banks usual sources of liquidity could become depleted
3278586 if you spend more money than you make you know what happens
3278587 a couple of divorces thrown in a few things like that
3278588 negative publicity relating to our financial results and the financial results of other financial institutions together with the seizure of indymac bank by federal regulators in july 2008 has caused a significant amount of customer deposit withdrawals
3278589 affecting our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations as they have come due
3278590 its so much easier to cut a tree than to make one grow
3278591 given the backsliding evident by 2005 and the weak economic forecasts ahead it seems likely that we will finish the current decade having ceded some of the stunning progress against concentrated poverty we achieved during the prior decade
3278592 i feel like nancy pelosi as the democratic leader has failed our country miserably funding for more war
3278593 the speakers failed to hold george bush and dick cheney accountable
3278594 is to have stakeholders in my community link up conservation strategies and activities with effective poverty reduction and build the capacity of women in financial management
3278595 an optimized design based on a copper interconnect process and new circuit technology
3278596 it gave me the skills that i needed to stay away from drugs and alcohol and violence in general and it gave me the knowledge to help my friends
3278597 i hope to learn easier ways to say no because i dont want just to say oh not now or no thanks i want to learn how to say no and be done with it
3278598 my daughter was not exactly enthusiastic to go but i know once she gets there she is going to have a great time learn a lot of things and make lifetime friends
3278599 we have to make that decision but i believe he will play yes
3278600 he has worked very hard since he has come back
3278601 you cannot say he will be at his best but he will be fit enough because his reaction on saturday after the game did not seem too bad
3278602 at 21 he already has a lot of experience and he is an intelligent boy but i would not like to put too much pressure on him
3278603 we know we have every single player in his area is very important and now he has maybe more experience than the others now
3278604 to win big trophies like euro 2008 makes you more confident and gives you something you can pass on to the team around you
3278605 when i tapped you over there i didnt mean it in a bad way i did it in a friendly way so i apologise
3278606 you wanted to do that a little bit too much
3278607 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to us residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions
3278608 and in the server event log ii get this error after the fialed startup of a vm
3278609 very odd as i only upgraded to the latest version of esx lastweek you
3278610 nicht aus um zu den ganz gro en im internet zu geh ren
3278611 it is our firm resolve that we will root out terrorism from pakistan and all of our security agencies are working together to achieve this goal
3278612 i also believe that techdude has gone awol because of the threats he and his family received
3278613 if our friend doesnt show up soon howard dean and barack obama have a lot to answer for
3278614 danceswithpumas reports that our friend checked in and is safe we are all very relieved but the point still stands we are sick and tired of the smears and dehumanizing speech and the death threats from the obama supporters and i have the proof in the spam filter complete with the ip and email addresses and the obama cheers theyre sickening its time to reign them in were people weve got lives and people who depend on us and none of us deserve this treatment from the mouths of the dnc the obama campaign and or obamas out of control supporters simply because we choose to exercise our right to speak freely and assemble enough is enough someone is going to get hurt
3278615 we shouldnt be going through this that we have to worry like this still on their heads
3278616 the threats and intimidation of those who do not bow down to obama this is one of the prime reasons why i will never vote for obama
3278617 we shoulnt have to be worrying about this its shameful
3278618 isnt it ridiculous that we must fear for our lives simply because we believe in our cause and wont follow the herd off the cliff
3278619 hillary 08 sticker because were all but certain that wed be the target of the obamabots rage that last thing we need is to have some violent a hole all hopped up on hopium run us off the road slash the tires or jump one of us in a parking lot
3278620 es m ssen ja nicht gleich edelsteine oder haute couture sein
3278621 trotzdem ist es erstaunlich was wir heute alles mit der getr nkedose machen k nnen
3278622 viele kennen die m glichkeiten die die getr nkedose bietet noch gar nicht
3278623 dabei hat sie einige berraschungen zu bieten und zwar nicht nur oberfl chlich betrachtet
3278624 trotzdem hat die gesamte region das ergebnis sportlich aufgenommen schlie lich z hlt am ende doch das olympische motto dabei sein ist alles
3278625 fakt ist auch dass fast dreimal h ufiger frauen gemobbt werden als m nner die mehrheitlich die t ter sind
3278626 damit es gar nicht soweit kommt m ssen unternehmen rechtzeitig eingreifen und f r den schutz ihrer mitarbeiter sorgen
3278627 daf r ist eine analyse der eigenen arbeitsorganisation unerl sslich
3278628 die preissteigerungen vom erdgas ber das roh l bis hin zur steinkohle haben uns nicht berrascht und lassen den schluss zu dass sich die preise f r brennstoff holzpellets wenn auch leicht nachlaufend und weniger explosiv weiter nach oben entwickeln unterst tzt wird diese entwicklung durch die nunmehr ver nderten f rderans tze der bundesregierung die der w rmeproduktion mittels holzpellets eine maximale f rderung zuteil werden lassen
3278629 mit den realinvests pellet engineering beteiligungsgesellschaften bauen wir unser attraktives beteiligungsforum als grundlage f r die emission von nachhaltigen anlageprodukten aus
3278630 ber die solarenergie und holzpellet produktion hinaus werden wir das portfolio noch im laufenden jahr auf weitere energie bereiche erweitern
3278631 der bedarf an telegrammen ist hoch moderne kommunikationsmittel wie sms e mail oder fax sto en bei manchen anl ssen einfach an ihre grenzen
3278632 es gibt viele private wie berufliche anl sse bei denen ein telegramm die beste alternative darstellt wenn sie zum beispiel den geburtstag ihrer gro mutter vergessen haben und ihr am selben tag noch gl ckw nsche zukommen lassen m chten ein anruf aber nicht ausreicht oder sie m chten kunden zu besonderen ereignissen gratulieren wie z b zur geburt eines kindes oder einer hochzeit bei einer solchen gelegenheit macht ein telegramm das pers nlich berbracht wird viel mehr eindruck als eine sms ein fax oder eine karte und sie k nnen die blumen gleich mit liefern lassen
3278633 this is our last best chance at seeing small independent businesses sustaining themselves
3278634 there is no other part of lansing that has as many mom and pop shops
3278635 and its frustrating lansing unfortunately is good at talking a big game i cant see why we cant have an amazing downtown corridor
3278636 you would think when times are tight there is a better use of funds
3278637 i like to see what i pay for be what the city needs
3278638 id hate to see them tear michigan avenue up just to do it again for the next project
3278639 we are hoping they come up with good solutions and ideas so that michigan avenue can be a destination
3278640 if we dont get adequate input then the decision is going to be made by staff i want the public to help decide
3278641 i think it would be arrogant to think that only the east lansing lansing and lansing township staffs have the monopoly of some good ideas
3278642 the average ticket price is 53 one way which in a lot of cases is cheaper than filling up your tank with gas
3278643 i was going to drive my car but gas prices are so high that im just going to take the bus instead
3278644 were all confident that fuel increases have played a part in our ridership increases
3278645 basically if you have somebody who is unlicensed its either because theyve had their license removed because of poor driver skills or theyve made a conscious choice to not go through driver courses
3278646 that lack of experience without going through driver training is going to put them through a higher risk of getting in an accident
3278647 just this morning this woman was coming through the intersection and she had to stop because a man ran through a red light
3278648 were always amazed at the stuff we see up here
3278649 were still trying to catch up on last years stuff theres so many hours in a day
3278650 sure they can i just hope they dont try to replace the lost workers with contract employees
3278651 to actually have to say goodbye to some workers especially in this economy
3278652 so it is an absolute last resort i want to assure the residents of lansing we will get the core functions of city government accomplished
3278653 its been 10 or 11 years since weve had a real rain problem
3278654 even on friday our bucket brigade donations were higher than last year
3278655 the only one i could play is the drums because no one chose it
3278656 thirty percent of the worlds storage in the next two years is going to be these medical images
3278657 i was rather surprised in terms of some of the numbers that datacentres were using in terms of energy
3278658 all of this requires us to take a new approach
3278659 i really think where we are headed is to create true architectures for our datacenters
3278660 weve been virtualising on the mainframe for 35 years were just talking about bringing that out into all the other environments as well
3278661 its not like theres a silver bullet the issue in implementing virtualisation is doing the end to end architectural thinking around soa
3278662 it allows attackers to do anything malicious on any mobile device
3278663 by combining the vulnerabilities with the series 40 issues one could develop malware which could be simply deployed and that malware wont be visible to the user
3278664 at least one from each major family in the series
3278665 there are six long months of work in this research
3278666 some will be against this and some will be for it
3278667 they have a choice whether they want to sign up for our security research or whether they want to devote research engineers of their own to investigate the vulnerabilities
3278668 this is the first time that such a widespread and critical attack has been demonstrated against nokias series 40 devices
3278669 we have proved that these devices can be hacked and infected with malware in a very similar way pc computers are
3278670 but in time people will be able to judge on their own whether we got it right
3278671 what happened in the riot is one hundredth of what should happen what will happen
3278672 this is just crazy talk from someone who is pissed off
3278673 the kids insult the cops and pretend to be surprised when they get a reaction
3278674 the police have the unfortunate tendency to lump everyone with brown skin into some street gang when in reality most people here study hard and work hard
3278675 there is a real failure to communicate on both sides
3278676 the kids insult the cops and pretend to be surprised when they get a reaction
3278677 the police have the unfortunate tendency to lump everyone with brown skin into some street gang when in reality most people here study hard and work hard
3278678 there is a real failure to communicate on both sides
3278679 on saturday the cops overreact and shoot three young guys who did nothing wrong on sunday they do nothing while this happens
3278680 i heard my brother say what are you doing to my brother and then i heard gunshots
3278681 my brother tried to help me and now hes dead
3278682 i feel very bad i feel very upset and we will get to the bottom of what happened
3278683 because of an idiotic move by one officer the bums and the gangs get inflamed and then the cops are powerless to do anything
3278684 strategy page reports that the united states air force has announced its first air wing that will
3278685 the gao also called on the faa to work with the department of defense which has extensive unmanned aircraft experience to issue its program plan in addition the department of homeland security dhs assesses the security implications of routine unmanned aircraft access to commercial airspace the gao said even if all issues are addressed and there are a number of critical problems unmanned aircraft may not receive routine access to the national airspace system until 2020 the gao concluded
3278686 flying drones from halfway across the world used to be considered a cushy military job but the iraq and afghanistan wars have become so dependent on the robo planes that the air force has
3278687 i do think they could have waited a bit if they want a worldwide hit i have them all up here pointing to her beehive
3278688 i guess they are going for clean cut and boring when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit
3278689 delivers more controls a streamlined setup improved start up performance and powerful new graphics features for client development and rich data scaffolding improved ajax support and other improvements for web development additionally it introduces support for the ado net entity framework and ado net data services
3278690 for fifty bucks id put my face in their soup and blow
3278691 its their job to approve a facility the city does not do that
3278692 some parts of toronto this would be permitted some it would not be
3278693 the safety of propane storage is especially significant to the city of toronto because resident and working population densities are so high that any level of hazard is one that could affect hundreds of persons in a single incident
3278694 it may be assumed that as redevelopment in the city continues and as the automotive propane distribution networks grow this fundamental conflict will intensify
3278695 the city wouldnt be in a position to know whether a facility has followed up with the province and achieved its licence
3278696 gamesindustry biz has become an essential part of my morning routine its global viewpoint is a perfect bellwether for industry news trends and events theres nothing quite like a coffee and an exclusive scoop
3278697 absolutely ron george should be thrown out for voting for gay marriage
3278698 he has a very radical view of whats a family
3278699 i really felt that as chief justice i had to have the broad shoulders because i knew there would be substantial controversy about it
3278700 most people thought his legacy would be the modernization of the courts
3278701 i think the gay marriage decision will now be his principal legacy
3278702 it isnt anything that i have given any thought to i will do what i should do when that time comes about
3278703 the people are asking with this outcome that their leaders find a way to reach an accord
3278704 we reiterate our support for bolivias unity and territorial integrity and remain committed to be a good partner in bolivias journey to a more democratic prosperous future
3278705 evo should be declared president of all the indians of this continent
3278706 there are already withdrawals in some of the areas of concern
3278707 we hope we can finish all these clearing operations soon
3278708 i dont know when all my neighbors can return im seeing at least five houses gutted by fire
3278709 they are repositioning to a place safe and far enough to prevent exchanges of gunfire from both sides
3278710 might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia
3278711 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia
3278712 the u n must stand up for the sovereignty of its members and peace in the world
3278713 they woke up this weekend and figured out that that ad resonated and they needed to do something about it
3278714 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3278715 we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century not regression to the conflicts of the past
3278716 it is unlikely that aggression against our nato allies will occur with aircraft and tanks and troops
3278717 a nation could achieve the same and worse effects simply by turning off the taps people freeze industry stops
3278718 paying more attention and letting these countries know we are paying attention is our main objective
3278719 people think its too flattering to me that alexei miller was kind of stalking me when i was in the region
3278720 given the characteristics of russian diplomacy which have been not only competitive but sometimes gripping people by the throat they are likely to feel irritated that someone else is in the field
3278721 the united states does not have a clear consistent strategy to promote our long term security interests or our near term energy and economic interests the russians do
3278722 the united states cannot offer an adequate alternative a political resource with no economic element is not enough
3278723 something we were withholding made us weak until we found that it was ourselves
3278724 meine tochter war ein opfer genau wie mein enkel sie hatte berhaupt keine kontrolle ber die situation
3278725 it was mostly ad libbed with russell asking her for advice about hosting the show
3278726 haydens mom drank way too much and was being rude to everyone her dad was trying to put her in her place lesley striked him several times before he hit her
3278727 i am waiting to see the commitments they will make on issues like international justice refugees and how to address the needs of parturition in crisis around the world
3278728 actually we dont disagree as much as youd think i think people assume im a democrat but im registered third edition by the editors of the american heritage dictionary copyright 2003 and im still undecided so im looking at mccain as well as obama
3278729 my dream was to play nrl while im still at school and to do it while im still in year 11 its just a great thing to come true and i just cant believe this has happened
3278730 i think a big thing in playing first grade is confidence and hes naturally a very confident kid
3278731 theres certain guys who can play first grade at a young age and theres certain ones youve got to leave a little bit longer but i thought confidence wise he doesnt lack anything there
3278732 in all honesty hes not really ready for first grade
3278733 hes got a lot of ability i think that was on display for everyone to see i was very pleased with what i saw especially from the future point of view
3278734 the newcastle boys were giving me a bit of a rough up but you get that when youre playing footy and youre the youngest out there
3278735 internally illuminated street signs mainly located in metropolitan areas provide directional signage and at the same time allow for impactful branding 24 hours a day making them ideal for retail businesses
3278736 businesses wishing to promote their products and services will benefit from the medium
3278737 we have employed local sub contractors vhukile welding works and baeteledi pele to assist with the installation and maintenance of the units
3278738 the stories lynne shares reveal the heart of a mother who struggles to keep faith at the center of her life through its many unexpected twists and serendipitous turns

3278746 las sensaciones no son del todo buena no es una sensaci n agradable porque me voy sin nada de lo que vinimos a buscar pero esto es algo que acontece en los ltimos meses
3278747 ten sticamente no consigo avanzar y es algo que me est pasando hace rato lo nico que queda es seguir tratando buscar las soluciones quedan algunos torneos uno de ellos grande y aunque no tengo las mismas expectativas que antes voy a intentar mejorar
3278748 hoy qued conforme con el primer set mejor con respecto al primer d a pero cuando llega el momento de cerrar un game o un set no lo puedo afrontar tiene que ver con la confianza y conmigo
3278749 los tenistas no podemos tener siempre un gran a o voy a seguir para conseguir jugar de la mejor forma
3278750 la derrota en los juegos ol mpicos es m s dura que cuando jug s en el circuito
3278751 my retired parents used to help a company deliver phone books for a little extra cash they were given lists of streets they were required to deliver phone books to there was no opt out list and management would do spot checks to ensure that they hit every house i hate to tell you this but you can forget about not receiving a phone book
3278752 in austria everyone gets a little postcard which you just return without postage if you dont want a new phonebook
3278753 in germany they send you a postcard and you go with it to the nearest post office to pick up the book so if you want one it is more inconvenient as you have to make the trip if you dont no harm done
3278754 id love to play more tests for australia and that remains a big goal but theres a lot of work to do before i think about that
3278755 my immediate goal is to win the starting job for the western force and hopefully play some really good consistent rugby next year

3278759 wed hoped that was the beginning of an opening in the democratic space
3278760 but the political space is contracting again its clear the ruling party is determined to stay in power by any means
3278761 i dont think the political space is in any way being constrained
3278762 they dont claim they want a socialist state but the ideology is still there
3278763 the international community espouses ideas about good governance transparency and human rights but then they help a regime that flouts and violates those fundamental rights
3278764 i dont think the american people or the congress are going to accept decreasing food when there are photographs from ethiopia of starving children
3278765 they are going to ask why arent you helping these starving kids
3278766 before when we were operating in a full fledged dictatorship you knew what you could and couldnt do
3278767 now there is more openness but you dont know where the line is until youve crossed it
3278768 i think it will be a number of years before they start paying taxes again

3278901 its very actually breezy if you will but usually for the most part they will leave within one to two days of being eliminated from the show
3278902 thats something you understand when youre voted off that ends for you and it goes on for the others and you just make room and its completely understandable
3278903 we make room for the other people because they have to focus on the competition then
3278904 i feel a stress lifted off my shoulders the experience was great and i wouldnt wish it away but there is a lot of stress that comes with it we dont mind leaving at all because it makes room for the others to pursue the dream
3278905 i still keep in touch with a lot of the various cast members that have been on the show
3278906 im always interested to see whats going on in their careers and what i can do to help what insight production co ltd can do what ctv can do because the whole point of the show is to get as many people out there doing what they want to do which is to make music

3278957 ever since charles darwins discovery of giant ground sloth remains in south america debate has ensued about the cause of early extinction of the worlds megafauna

3278963 we are focusing on india china and the middle east and on sectors such as it agriculture and power generation investors have long been watching ghana where a key strength is its multi party democracy
3278964 through our subsidiary suntechnics we have already installed several hundred renewable energy systems for environmentally friendly solar power and thus improved the living standards of more than 100 000 people in 250 indian villages
3278965 till now more than 13 percent of the 600 000 remote villages in india lack electricity like dewri gowda most are located in remote territory which proves expensive and technologically challenging for power supplied through a public grid off grid renewable energy products such as solar powered home and street lighting systems thus serve as affordable and efficient alternatives while also being environment friendly
3278966 indias potential for renewable energy projects far exceeds the current installed capacity of the current 144 913 megawatts of energy produced in india only 8 4 percent comes from renewable sources
3278967 i like janice hahn very much were just here to tell her to kick it up a notch
3278968 except where payments are self executing under the california constitution the state has no authority to pay state employees their full salaries where it does not have an appropriation such as in this case where there is no budget for fiscal year 2008 2009
3278969 the governor has created a solution to a problem that does not exist
3278970 rather than focus on building consensus for a budget that addresses californias long term fiscal problems the governor seems adamant on picking a fight over whether state employees are entitled to the wages they have worked for and earned
3278971 were still talking we havent thrown anything at each other
3278972 the approximate 10 percent increase in taximeter rates is much needed due to the overall escalation in fuel and other operating expenses
3278973 we recognize these cancellations have significantly impacted our customers with travel plans to or from alaska
3278974 these decisions are guided by our commitment to safety and we are making every effort to re accommodate passengers whose flight schedules have been disrupted
3278975 as much about how much an impact the food has on your wallet as on your waistline
3278976 we want to make sure that if were going to raise the rates that this is going to truly benefit trauma services as much as possible
3278977 without this money were looking at having to potentially cut 37 million worth of services
3278978 today the residents and commuters of los angeles county are at a crossroads between the past and the future
3278979 we think the choice is clear the time to make this choice is now it has been the lack of political will that has been the fundamental wrench the cost of status quo is simply unacceptable
3278980 this is about higher election costs being unfairly passed onto the taxpayers
3278981 what were going to be looking at is everything and anything
3278982 we have funding to fill the gap on the 405 freeway from wilshire boulevard to the 101 freeway
3278983 this facility was allowed under zoning that has been there for well over a decade
3278984 flash fiction is an ancient form but has grown hugely in popularity in these attention deficit times with the growth of the internet if standard short fiction is like a one day international think of the quick tales contest as the twenty20 of contemporary story telling
3278985 india was our first port of call after we acquired livejournal last december

3278992 we are pulling out all the stops to deliver a more efficient package for customers who need the capability of full size pickups and suvs and want the very best fuel economy
3278993 our pickups and suvs are already the fuel economy leaders of their respective segments but our engineers knew greater efficiency was achievable we fast tracked the xfe models to get them into dealer showrooms as quickly as possible
3278994 in addition to the xfe models gm already offers hybrid versions of the tahoe and yukon that achieve up to a 50 percent improvement in city fuel economy and coming in the first half of 2009 are the silverado and sierra hybrids
3278995 these hybrid pickups offer up to 25 percent overall increased fuel economy and greater than 40 percent improved mileage in city driving
3278996 we know that parents have tremendous influence over how many fruits and vegetables their children eat
3278997 when parents eat more fruits and vegetables so do their children when parents eat and give their children high fat snacks or soft drinks children learn these eating patterns instead
3278998 this research shows that its important to communicate with parents in real world settings
3278999 they control the food environment for their young child this environment is key to not only what children eat today but how they will eat in the future
3279000 it could be used to increase yield in horticultural industries and manual pruning may be circumvented through the use of the natural strigolactones
3279001 because strigolactones are natural compounds which directly control shoot branching they can be applied without the use of gene transfer technologies and have minimal side effects on the plant
3279002 our discovery provides the first biosynthetic mutants to study these important interactions with plants and to develop ways of plant improvement and weed management
3279003 we are very excited about this discovery because hormones in plants and animals are an amazingly powerful and natural way to modify and investigate growth and development

3279006 the whole conflict is not being waged over the pipeline the reasons are definitely geopolitical
3279007 however the russians know the pipeline is important to georgia and may try to damage it they have the capability to do so
3279008 this shows that russia has not just targeted georgian economic outlets but international economic outlets
3279009 for europeans an alternative supply route is psychological reassurance its having a route that does not go through russia
3279010 but the other countries the pipeline passes through may ultimately prove more unreliable
3279011 and please make your position and speak with one united voice
3279012 i like your articles but the independent had a footnote the other day saying that stalin divided north and south ossetia its not true south ossetia has always been georgian
3279013 vi s g allvarligt p det det var ett grovt brott mot universitetets regler

3279023 there were some very good papers on which we couldnt understand why the grades were so low and there were others we felt had been over graded
3279024 if something that looks like a b is only given an e its difficult to sit there and do nothing about it
3279025 eight years ago we did between 50 and 60 each year for gcse and a level
3279026 we deal with five times that number now its a full time job through september just keeping up with them
3279027 i think its a natural consequence of having more information
3279028 when i took a level you got your grade b and that was it job done now you know you got a b because you did this well in one paper and that well in another if one wasnt very good then lets get a re mark to see if we can wallop the grade up
3279029 while theres no logical reason to think that because ets got into difficulty with tests there will be a problem with the a level boards people will tend to be more sensitive this year
3279030 over say 10 or 15 years its quite clear that the chances of an appeal actually making a difference to the grade has increased and that will tend to increase the number of appeals that are put in when i was an examinations officer in a school in the 1980s i would say to students dont waste your money the chances are you screwed up an answer in recent years theres been a tendency to say give it a go you may go up a grade
3279031 i think the system is so stretched that we are beginning to lose faith we are increasingly asking for re marks
3279032 but i do think its also to do with the clientele wanting rechecks as it becomes more difficult to get into the best universities people want cs turned into bs and bs turned into as
3279033 no if u say theres tension then we should work on it for our similar friends

3279079 i hope it will not be the case that i get priced out of a move
3279080 if the club dont want me they know that ive been a faithful servant so in a perfect world being allowed to leave for a reasonable price would happen

3279241 his defense is his asset hes a very good defensive player
3279242 there are some things kevin bradshaw roving minor league fielding instructor has worked with him on he worth picks things up relatively quickly
3279243 i was totally flabbergasted by that article totally caught off guard
3279244 i want you to quote every word i say not part of it but everything i say
3279245 when we made the trade for gary sheffield we received permission from the commissioners office to speak with him before the deal which i did and i told him that all i had here for him was the dh role and maybe to play in the outfield once in a great while
3279246 if he did not want to accept that do not accept the trade im still confused by the article because it talks about being platooned doesnt set well with him
3279247 gary sheffield hasnt been platooned here platooning is when you have a left handed hitter and a right handed hitter one plays against a right handed pitcher the other plays against a left handed pitcher that is a platoon to make it perfectly clear
3279248 thats platooning to me if im not playing every day im platooning if youre an everyday player you play 59 out of 59 unless you cant play call it what you want i call it what i want
3279249 he might think its different we might disagree on that its not a big deal its a matter of thats the way i see it
3279250 in my mind im not going to accept thats what i am
3279251 but if thats my position thats fine i didnt want to be put down as dh and i made that clear when i signed here but thats what happened thats my role i dont have to like it i just have to accept it
3279252 im capable of playing the outfield thats just how good i feel if i feel good i have a right to say it if i dont i have a right to say i dont i dont like it but i understand it thats all i said
3279253 whoever takes offense to it thats their problem i havent said anything all year and im not going to start now if they want to take that as a negative thing then go right ahead i really dont care anyways
3279254 like i said im shocked because this caught me totally off guard before injuries put him on the disabled list he played in 39 of 51 games but in seven other games he couldnt go to the post because his shoulder was clicking
3279255 after being on the dl hes played in 36 of 43 games to me thats the farthest thing from a platoon ive ever heard of in my life so im totally flabbergasted by it anybody with a brain knows thats not a platoon
3279256 i also read that he wants to play in the outfield i tried to play him in the outfield it didnt work he couldnt throw the ball in
3279257 i have medical people telling me its suicidal to play him in the outfield right now hed probably get hurt again
3279258 i just dont get the drift of this im not upset one bit but if you want to lead you dont do that by voice you lead by example
3279259 thats how you lead im not talking about gary sheffield im talking about anybody you dont lead by yelling you lead by example
3279260 you lead by playing hard by showing other people how you play the game bust your butt thats how you lead the kind of leadership sheffield shows is by knocking in runs and pounding the ball thats the kind of leader hes been thats the kind of leader i want
3279261 ive always been an admirer of garys because he speaks what he feels i think hes admired me for the same reason nobodys been in his corner more than me
3279262 feel like a caged tiger what the heck are you talking about when hes been healthy hes produced i feel bad that hes had these injuries those arent his fault but theyre not jim leylands fault either i cant help it hes had injuries
3279263 yo quiero que la ciudad aproveche el 23 de noviembre para cambiar un gobierno municipal precario para cambiar una situaci n ins lita que hay dinero para regalarlo a cuba bolivia y otras naciones y no hay dinero para el guarataro la pedrera ni para los manolos ni para chapell n

3279266 si tiene dudas a lo que pasa en la base vamos a unas elecciones primarias hoy y ma ana se terminan de inscribir todos los candidatos hay tiempo de sobra yo he propuesto la fecha del 21 de septiembre para que todos los candidatos puedan exponer sus programas
3279267 cada quien tiene sus comentarios dentro de ese mundillo de rumores hay para todos pero no quiero perder un minuto en intrigas y mucho menos en empujones verbales
3279268 yo quiero que la ciudad aproveche el 23 de noviembre para cambiar un gobierno municipal precario para cambiar una situaci n ins lita que hay dinero para regalarlo a cuba bolivia y otras naciones pero no hay dinero para el guarataro la pedrera los manolos ni para chapell n esos son absurdos desde todo punto de vista
3279269 ese es el drama de la ciudad de caracas no esta confrontaci n e intriga pol tica que no nos lleva a ning n lugar hay una especie de gui n del conflicto que es muy noticioso pero que es in til para los caraque os que queremos unidad integraci n soluciones y para eso es mi candidatura
3279270 es un buen indicador de cu ntas reservas la ciudad y el pa s tienen de cu nta gente comprometida quiere hacer un aporte para resolver los problemas del pa s

3279330 its not fun when you dont know what youre doing
3279331 he knew the defenses because he studied his butt off but he didnt know the pass routes obviously he was behind because it was all new to him you expect that to happen it took two years for a d to learn those things
3279332 last year at this time i was just trying to get comfortable
3279333 i was starting for the first time replacing a d this year is different i want to produce but i also want to make plays
3279334 when we need a play i want to be one of those people they look to to make plays when you play on a defense like ours with a ed reed there are certain expectations and you have to play up to those expectations
3279335 we have a great front seven and our defensive line dominates
3279336 without them our linebacking corps wouldnt be as good they allow us to be patient sit back and make good reads overall if we stay healthy i think rex wants us to be more aggressive than a year ago
3279337 we have this unwritten rule on defense that if you see someone throw a punch at one of us were going to pin our ears back and come at you

3279418 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3279419 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3279420 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3279421 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3279422 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3279423 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3279424 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3279425 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3279426 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3279427 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3279428 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3279429 who are open to doing something on the production side
3279430 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3279431 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3279432 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3279433 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3279434 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3279435 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3279436 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3279437 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3279438 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3279439 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3279440 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3279441 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3279442 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3279443 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3279444 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3279445 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3279446 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3279447 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3279448 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3279449 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3279450 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3279451 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3279452 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3279453 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3279454 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3279455 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3279456 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3279457 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3279458 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3279459 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3279460 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3279461 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3279462 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3279463 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3279464 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3279465 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3279466 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3279467 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3279468 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3279469 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3279470 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3279471 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3279472 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3279473 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3279474 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3279475 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3279476 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3279477 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3279478 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3279479 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3279480 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3279481 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3279482 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3279483 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3279484 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3279485 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3279486 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3279487 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3279488 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3279489 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3279490 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3279491 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3279492 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3279493 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3279494 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3279495 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3279496 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3279497 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3279498 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3279499 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3279500 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3279501 the deteriorating economic condition is putting new stress on europe which seems to be even weaker now than the u s
3279502 some pessimists even talk now about the euro area breaking apart i would not go that far but we do know the honeymoon is over and this is the first real test of the marriage that we have seen
3279503 every two to three weeks the prices are going up we are buying less just like everybody else
3279504 we know this isnt going to be easy to bounce back from
3279505 our problem is that we adopted an american model of growth looking to services and construction and quick returns
3279506 it made us more like the united states and less like germany now we see that was a huge mistake
3279507 i like janice hahn very much were just here to tell her to kick it up a notch
3279508 for the well being of the individual two things are necessary the first and most essential is to act virtuously it is through virtue in fact that we live a good life the other and secondary requirement is rather a means and lies in a sufficiency of material goods such as are necessary to virtuous action
3279509 woe to him who builds his house on wrong his terraces on injustice who works his neighbor without pay and gives him no wages who says i will build myself a spacious house with airy rooms who cuts out windows for it panels it with cedar and paints it with vermilion must you prove your rank among kings by competing with them in cedar did not your father eat and drink he did what was right and just and it went well with him because he dispensed justice to the weak and the poor it went well with him is this not true knowledge of me says the lord
3279510 in the 1999 constitution article 299 for example emphasizes human development as the cornerstone of social judgments and article 70 states that the involvement of people in the exercise of their social and economic affairs should be manifest through citizen service organs self management co management cooperatives in all forms community enterprises as well as other kinds of associations guided by the values of mutual cooperation and solidarity
3279511 another innovative feature of the bolivarian project or revolution depending on your opinion are the socialist production units
3279512 seek ye first the kingdom of heaven and all these things will be added unto you
3279513 capitalism is the way of the devil and exploitation if you really want to look at things through the eyes of jesus christ who i think was the first socialist only socialism can really create a genuine society
3279514 it took prodding from congress to persuade the cftc to finally request information from swap dealers about the participation of sovereign wealth funds in the commodity markets
3279515 the regulatory body in charge of policing our futures markets has been remarkably incurious about the role sovereign wealth funds play in commodity markets
3279516 its going to hem in the fed its going to be harder for the fed to weaken what theyve proposed
3279517 it sends a message that you did the right thing
3279518 the fed is going to act and is going to establish a new baseline for consumer protection that everyone will follow
3279519 we hope they will consider the impact this will have on pricing in the marketplace and the big question of whether or not low risk consumers are going to have to subsidize people who pose a higher risk
3279520 obama has criticized bush for his fiscal irresponsibility and now hes using bushs baseline as a yardstick by which to measure fiscal responsibility
3279521 congress hasnt agreed to extend the bush tax cuts because they dont have the money to pay for it
3279522 its not unreasonable to say were inheriting a budget thats going to have substantial deficits into the future
3279523 said a democratic congressional aide who spoke on condition of anonymity so he could speak candidly
3279524 leaving some of the tax cuts in place would cost us a small fortune
3279525 i dont know that any blue dog has a good way to pay for that
3279526 president bush created this problem we would put in place rules so it never happens again
3279527 but a sound budget is based on making realistic promises and sticking to them
3279528 ive never felt ive been valued by anyone im just a waste of space that everyone ignores like a ghost without a home
3279529 we are very excited to be releasing the pc version of grand theft auto iv the whole team is dedicated to bringing an amazing gaming experience to the pc the game looks and plays beautifully on pc and we cant wait for people to play it
3279530 i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional out there
3279531 as soon as lezak came off that last wall i started going crazy
3279532 i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional out there
3279533 as soon as lezak came off that last wall i started going crazy
3279534 we might not even qualify anybody because its not looking good
3279535 our young guys arent going to international competitions they arent travelling and getting experience so essentially theyre being failed by the system
3279536 just trying to enjoy 100 per cent the experience and later try my best on court
3279537 its a great thing going out there playing for your country
3279538 it was a lot i cant count but it was cool i guess
3279539 i had a lot of opportunities i didnt convert so that was tough
3279540 but i was winning the serves without problems he had more problems than me when he was serving so that gave me confidence
3279541 its just a matter of losing some matches where i feel like i shouldnt have lost
3279542 and then sometimes it plays a trick in your mind where you think maybe youre not playing that well actually but its actually not the case so its a matter of keeping yourself in a positive mind set
3279543 its a good situation that you can ask that question
3279544 i have probably been the leading player in europe for close to six years
3279545 it is a big step now to move up and start competing on a different level ive got phil ive got tiger ahead of me i dont necessarily pay attention to what theyre doing i pay attention to more what im doing
3279546 many periods in my career ive had lulls where ive been in between things and come out stronger
3279547 im looking at this period as one of those that i am coming out stronger with experience and im putting a lot more things together
3279548 its a long way to catch tiger at the top
3279549 but i know that the only way of focusing on doing that is focusing on me controlling what i can do
3279550 i obviously hold a lot of european players who i grew up watching in high esteem
3279551 to believe that i achieved something they hadnt is very special
3279552 i dodged a bullet because there was some more high profile losers that day
3279553 but i walked away from that tournament knowing i could win a major
3279554 and youve got to lose them to know you can win them ive got to put myself in the position and learn from it and understand it before i actually go and do it
3279555 i m totally shocked i dont like the thought of it at all im totally opposed to them
3279556 i hadnt heard anything about it but if i heard it was happening again i would object
3279557 im against it i dont want them having meetings here i dont agree with them and i think theyre no good to mankind
3279558 it was simply a hire i dont look at it politically i believe in freedom of speech
3279559 do not fear for i am with you do not anxiously look about you for i am your god i will strengthen you surely i will help you surely i will uphold you with my righteous right hand
3279560 yes but theyll never learn to take care of themselves and they are ultimately going to suffer down the road because their parents spoiled them
3279561 no i cant do that trivial annoying thing you are putting too much pressure on me to do that you never should have asked me to do in the first place

3279563 the jets were 4 12 what the hell are they thinking in trading for a 38 year old codger
3279564 i still dont know what i did wrong before my last round i did the exact same preparation i probably started trying too hard
3279565 i wanted to be canadas first medal of the games because i heard today going out on the bus that we hadnt won a medal yet
3279566 everybody asked me what do you think of this one compared to 1984 but 1984 was in l a so not many people were there
3279567 today here i feel like im back home everybody calling my name they still remember me im so happy to be here in beijing
3279568 brents lead off time really charged us up for swimming fast
3279569 this is a huge step for us and being under world record pace has proved that we belong here
3279570 playing against italy was a tough draw but we shot well together
3279571 at one point we had a four point lead and kept shooting strong which made italy have to really step up their game
3279572 i was nervous going in because keating is a guy who is so athletic and athleticism can always put you to the test
3279573 but i felt steady and more confident as it went along it felt nice to get back out there and whack the ball in this environment
3279574 this tournament is a huge priority but im kind of gearing up for that too
3279575 so every match i get under my belt against these good guys is going to be great preparation for that
3279576 i played him three years ago here and beat him but hes hit a lot of balls since then and ive gotten three years older
3279577 it will be a challenging match we play a very similar game style and at this point hes better at it than i am but well go out there and ive got nothing to lose
3279578 i know when the matches get tough if you keep it the same game plan theyre going to start realizing it and theyre going to mould their style
3279579 so my plan is to give something different use a game plan but once they start getting a hold of that one throw something else at them just kind of mix it up a bit
3279580 we cant continue to perform this way late in the game
3279581 we have to make some adjustments i have to figure out what i have and who is willing to step up in those roles
3279582 today was a big win for us a big win
3279583 we have to refocus and not allow this to cross over into this road trip
3279584 i didnt want to let the team down like i did previously
3279585 i got in there worked the count and got the pitch that i was waiting for
3279586 you just keep going out there and keep battling its all you can do
3279587 gatwick is the eighth most busy airport in the world and the sheer volume of passengers coming to london airports is a testimony to the attractions of the city and the dynamism of the british economy but in four years we are due to welcome the world to the london olympics and we need to sort this chaos out now with gatwick full to bursting and with heathrows third runway already bitterly contested and i bet it never gets built it is also ever more urgent that we investigate the possibility of a long term solution in the form of a new and more eco friendly international airport at a site in the thames estuary of which you will be hearing a lot more in due course
3279588 i know that there is a huge appetite for read across and everybody wants to see me as the advance guard london is meant to be the petri dish into which tory central office is introducing the bacillus of their policies but its not like that at all

3279618 i will announce the captain the day before the czech republic game and i will speak with the captain just a moment before the announcement is made at the team hotel
3279619 the next game is important because we will be together again for the first time in the new season against the czechs the first eleven will be the best for me at this moment
3279620 after the games against the usa and trinidad and tobago when we stayed for ten days together its very important for me to be together another time
3279621 the match against the czechs is also important because its a good test to know which players are very fit at this moment the andorra and croatia matches are very close
3279622 we will qualify for the world cup in south africa i am sure of it
3279623 were a very good team for us the opponent is not important the important thing is what we do
3279624 i announce the squad on saturday after the first day of the premier league but the most important games will be played on sunday
3279625 gerrard and rooney are very important players and i dont know whether they will be fit for this game i hope they will be fit for andorra and croatia and well be able to play them in the squad
3279626 its very important for me that the players that i decide to put in the squad are playing for their clubs and are getting games
3279627 its impossible to be fit if you dont play in pre season games
3279628 there are already withdrawals in some of the areas of concern

3279646 recent closures and curtailments of sawmills and plywood facilities related to the troubled housing market have hurt employment and wages in montanas wood products industry
3279647 the extent to which montanas industry recovers when markets improve however will depend largely on timber availability
3279648 job losses reduced wages and declines in lumber production can be painful but temporary issues that pass when conditions improve in the broader housing and wood products markets or these conditions could persist and worsen
3279649 with the uncertainty that surrounds timber availability in montana it can be difficult to rebuild capacity when markets eventually rebound

3279651 on the assumption that the subdued demand conditions are likely to continue scope to move to a less restrictive monetary policy stance in the period ahead is increasing
3279652 it is a little bit of a conundrum as far as the reserve bank is concerned but the market is very much looking at weak growth at the moment and that in part is driving the bond market
3279653 theres an indication that the market still wants to believe that the reserve bank is going to do a 50 basis point cut and soon even though the reserve bank appeared yesterday to be trying to temper those expectations
3279654 we know that the weakness has been concentrated in the household sector but the further deterioration in trading conditions forward orders and employment strongly suggests that business investment and employment are in for a hit later this year
3279655 we havent been immune from the global credit crunch which started with the sub prime mortgage issue in the united states and has gone on to infect global credit markets and obviously we havent been immune from the impact of increased oil prices either
3279656 were also seeing a slowing as a consequence of eight interest rate increases in the last three years so those factors are all in the mix

3279666 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3279667 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3279668 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3279669 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3279670 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3279671 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3279672 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3279679 people particularly enjoyed being long on australian us dollars on the back of a weakening us dollar especially as commodity prices were going up and it had a high yield
3279680 in the space of a very short period of time all those planks have been pulled out from under the aussie
3279681 i think what the market is overpricing by a long shot here is the idea that the us economy will somehow outperform europe it wont
3279682 while the aussie is down dont rule it out because if ever ive seen an overshooting of markets this is it in terms of everything against the us dollar
3279683 to meet the needs of all the industrial customers there
3279684 weve got two players that very much want to move into bankable feasibility studies immediately and weve been encouraged by that

3279691 fern ndez brings with him a lot of strength and experience and he will work alongside itzhak shum to make a good team better
3279692 i spoke to both luis and to shum and both agreed to these changes it would have been an easy popular decision to fire shum but i dont think it would have been a wise move as he won the league and cup double
3279693 they werent the most pleasant of days as we suffered a heavy defeat and are getting used to the idea of not playing in europe
3279694 as for my position i worked alongside giyora spiegel and will continue working and doing what i am doing alongside luis fern ndez as far as i am concerned there is hardly any change at all
3279695 fern ndez is a big name in europe and shum is as well
3279696 so i dont see why both cant work together i leave it to them as to how they work it out what i also leave to them is every decision concerning the squad
3279697 now there are benefits that players receive for certain accomplishments but we make sure that those benefits apply only to the type of gameplay from which they are earned for example certain tactics and items can be earned though questing that cant be earned in rvr but they only benefit players in pve portions of the game the reverse is true to rvr content and rewards

3279704 because he was a terrific storyteller about the music of the 60s and 70s and thats what our format then was all about
3279705 he knew everybody back to otis redding and he was still working when they made the film die hard 3 they commissioned him to do a new version of the lovin spoonful song summer in the city then they used the original in the movie so he talked about that on the air

3279724 there is some disappointing news for the consumer this week twelve days data out of a possible fourteen shows that consumers of gasoline will be hit with a 2 5 cent a litre increase at the pumps while heating and stove oil users should see a decrease of slightly better than four cents a litre i also expect that with the heating stove oil number pointing down it may also be an indicator of the direction that diesel will be headed this pricing session
3279725 even though oil pricing has been down the past couple of weeks weve seen an abject change in the value of the canadian dollar and that has cost the consumer in this country at least three cents a litre at the pumps and even more at the heating truck level in the last two weeks alone
3279726 oil pricing has been dropping for several reasons any of which has had monumental impact these last couple of weeks
3279727 were still watching some world geo political conditions out there that continue to affect the stability of oil pricing
3279728 waiting in the wings is also the weather remember that were into hurricane syndrome season and that means possible market plays against possible supply disruptions in the gulf of mexico we are fast coming up to the three year anniversary of hurricane katrina and rita and the national hurricane center has also increased its prediction on the number of possible storms it is promising to be an interesting couple of weeks and well worth watching

3279761 it was an advantage to be more anxious in a dangerous environment
3279762 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety

3279994 good luck to them because they are going to need it
3279995 the boss is driving us all nuts with this fbi madness
3279996 hopefully this will blow over real soon but right now i am stressed
3279997 i dont blame fumo the fbi is really coming at him hard and he is innocent
3279998 i truly believe that or i wouldnt do this when they cant find anything wrong they try to manufacutre stuff so they can justify the man hours and money spent on a fruitless investigation
3279999 we have everything under control thats just the way it has to be for now they fbi wont be around forever then we can go back to our normal routine
