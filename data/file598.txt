5980010 we hoped for musicians from logan to st george and everywhere in between

5980015 locally i feel that there is not enough promotion for these people so we are giving musicians an opportunity to promote themselves
5980016 it sounded like it was going to be really big and i really wanted to be a part of it
5980017 i know a lot of the artists that are performing there and would like to be considered on the same level as them
5980018 i think it is going to make a splash here and hopefully they can get a good crowd and continue to grow

5980023 we have visual art some graffiti type artists and some different kinds of dancers
5980024 musicians whether they are full time or semi professional need exposure but a true musician and artist likes being surrounded by diversity in music and art

5980036 the appeal of mobile marketing is that it triggers consumer responses to an advertising or promotional campaign
5980037 it fits well with campaigns using a multimedia marketing strategy mobile marketing is able to integrate with print radio television web and other outdoor channels to enhance brand experiences by capturing consumers attention and imagination
5980038 enabling spontaneous direct interactive and or targeted communications any time any place
5980039 while there is a cost to communicating directly to a targeted consumer segment or individual consumer via the mobile channel the benefits of this cost per message are the tangible results of qualified consumer interactions and the ability to communicate further with a new customer
5980040 the design and roll out of any mobile marketing campaign must comply with industry regulations for the advertising of mobile services as well as the sending of commercial messages

5980053 the energy use associated with the desal plant would be equivalent to some reasonably large country towns
5980054 so a town the size of shepparton or mildura the desal plant will be using as much energy as those towns so its a serious energy user and its going to make it that much harder for us to reduce our greenhouse emissions

5980062 this was the first tigerprint competition i have entered and it interested me because it gave me the chance to work to a live brief and also provided some well needed motivation it also gave me the opportunity to work on something which i might not have necessarily thought about before and is a great way to get creative exposure i have a degree in mixed media textile design from leeds university which provided me with a basis for much technique experimentation i have worked in sydney where i undertook many work placements including the role of assistant stylist for a interior design magazine as well as a designers assistant role at longina phillips textile design studio as for my design for the competition i wanted to create a simple yet striking design with a retro vibe about it i have really enjoyed working on this competition and will definately enter more in the future as a runner up its great to get some feedback from people within the industry i also like to look through the other entries as its a great idea to showcase how everyone responds to the brief
5980063 i love the work of tigerprint and came across trendthink whilst carrying out some research on the company this is the first competition which i have entered but i love the different topics for each competition and that they are aimed at such a well known brand as marks and spencer i studied graphic design at nottingham trent and now work as a freelance illustrator i am inspired by everything from childhood memories nature films to the colour turquoise i love to work with very different textures patterns materials and colours i like to observe the little things in life and interepret these through my illustrations i have very much enjoyed taking part in this competition and will be entering the childrens puzzle one next

5980083 it can be legal to sell steaks and roasts that carry a potentially deadly strain of e coli but it is not legal to sell that meat if it is going to be used to make ground beef
5980084 regulators do not monitor meat sold for steaks and roasts as closely as meat sold for ground beef because those primal cuts are less likely to make people sick for example if a steak is contaminated the bacteria are most likely on the outside and killed during cooking by contrast with ground beef the pathogen gets mixed in and can survive if the interior isnt heated to 160 degrees

5980114 i salute the archbishop and bishops of africa for resisting disorientation and a decadent culture which he said was being passed by western nations
5980115 dont fear resist and do not compromise on that it is a danger not only to the believers but to the whole of africa it is bad if our children become complacent and think that people who are not in order are alright these foreigners should go and practice their nonsense elsewhere that is the minimum demand
5980116 when i learnt that the bishop was being consecrated i thought of shoes for the bishop since walking is now outdated i thought i should give him a car which is parked outside
5980117 he fears for his life because of the campaign he has waged against homosexuals

5980127 officials concerned are working through the process of putting him on the plane to take him out of the country but if he continues to refuse to leave then he will confined in the airport transit area temporarily before being taken into a detention centre
5980128 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again
5980129 i dont want any sex offenders in this country but the point is vietnamese officials have deported him to the uk so as we do whenever sex offenders return to this country we need to plan for what happens when people return
5980130 never mind his individual case anybody who is returning to the uk in these sorts of circumstances would be met at the airport by police officers would be served with an order which effectively puts them on to the sex offenders register
5980131 one of the things we have learned generally about sex offenders is they do want to travel to places where they can exploit children
5980132 if there is evidence the person is travelling abroad to abuse children we can get an order that stops them travelling there should be more of those
5980133 in every single case the court has to make the decision but this is the type of case where i find it pretty hard to imagine it is legitimate for him to travel abroad again
5980134 i think its right that we use police time to monitor sex offenders
5980135 if you are a british citizen you have the right to use the nhs whatever we think about an individual and this is a pretty despicable person
5980136 the last information we have is that shortly before the flight to the uk departed he declined to board
5980137 he decides where he applies to go and the country or authorities there will decide whether they permit him to enter their territory

5980244 can direct him to assist mr branchflower thereby fulfilling her pledge to alaskans to cooperate fully with the investigation
5980245 while theres an investigation going on you assume innocence but you take the person out of the mix just so there are no questions raised
5980246 its not up to mr branchflower to take personnel actions that will be the governors call when the time comes

5980252 that would be an issue his administration would have to face early because hes pledging to be a uniter not a divider without saying those exact words we campaigned on in 2000 hes pledging to change the way washington works and if congress were to pursue that it would be very divisive
5980253 that could be very problematic for his presidency right off the start

5980262 over the time period of our survey the ice sheet as a whole was certainly losing mass and the mass loss increased by 75 per cent in 10 years
5980263 i see that as the main driver for the change in ice mass and this means that we are not in a natural cycle but in something that is related to global warming or global climate change whichever you want to call it

5980341 i think the formal process kicked off yesterday with the establishment of a nato georgia commission and we have taken seriously the commitments the heads of government made in april
5980342 its an important signal but there is also important substance to it
5980343 in practical terms nato is offering close cooperation with the georgian government and the georgian military that means helping the georgians build up their capacity
5980344 it means building up proper interoperability with nato proper joint training it also means ensuring the structures of cooperation are properly geared towards eventual membership so this is a route map to membership
5980345 ten years people were saying how could these countries be members of nato
5980346 they are independent countries they are not ex soviet union they are independent sovereign countries with democratic governments who have every right to make their own decisions on the basis of their own popular will
5980347 i think its right to see georgian and ukrainian membership as part of a process to build up these countries as a permanent fixture of the international landscape not just as an accident

5980356 i dont think weve played particularly bad in any of these games but tonight was one bad inning

5980358 weve been pitching well its just at the end we cracked the door for them and let them win
5980359 its frustrating because we didnt play well enough certainly in the eighth inning theres not much more you can say about it

5980363 diese sogenannten sieben wahrheiten zu angeblich berh hten pensionen in deutschland haben mit der realit t nichts zu tun so ein quatsch schafft es nur im sommerloch in die medien
5980364 erstens ist die pension eine vollversorgung bei vergleichen mit durchschnittsrenten m ssen betriebs und zusatzrenten ber cksichtigt werden au erdem gilt das verfassungsm ig gesch tzte alimentationsprinzip auch im ruhestand zweitens ist hinsichtlich der zuk nftigen versorgungsausgaben durch versorgungsr cklagen und fonds vorsorge getroffen zudem haben sich die prognosen der zu erwartenden lasten durch die zahlreichen sparma nahmen und ausgebliebene besoldungszuw chse der letzten jahre nicht unerheblich verbessert drittens wird anders als in bild behauptet bei der rente zur zeit weder riester noch nachhaltigkeitsfaktor angewendet f r versorgungsempf nger gilt der riesterfaktor uneingeschr nkt viertens wird die verl ngerung der lebensarbeitszeit selbstverst ndlich wirkungsgleich auf die beamten bertragen
5980365 was hier gemacht wird ist kein vergleich pfel und birnen mehr sondern eher eier mit wassermelonen die durchschnittsrente und die mindestversorgung ins verh ltnis zu setzen und dabei alle unterschiede in berechnung und begr ndung au er acht zu lassen ist wirklich abenteuerlich mit wahrheiten hat das gar nichts zu tun

5980386 june was the second straight month with more than a quarter million properties nationwide receiving foreclosure filings
5980387 foreclosure activity slipped 3 percent lower from the previous month but the year over year increase of more than 50 percent indicates we have not yet reached the top of this foreclosure cycle bank repossessions or reos continue to increase at a much faster pace than default notices or auction notices reos in june were up 171 percent from a year ago while default notices were up 38 percent and auction notices were up 22 percent over the same time period

5980391 borrowers and realtors say rates should be as low as possible end of story
5980392 but other people have to sort through the realities we just dont know enough about how the market will work exactly
5980393 most of the people who want to refinance probably have loans between 6 and 7 percent when they got loans in the past few years
5980394 unless the rate goes below 6 percent theres not much reason to refinance
5980395 right now in most markets the banks cant dump these foreclosed houses and as an investor it can be worth your while if youve got the guts to do it
5980396 there are people making money by investing in real estate in this market but it really depends on the situation and the location
5980397 its not a good idea to buy a foreclosed house in a neighborhood where there are a lot of houses for sale
5980398 investors are moving quickly and theyre going after the good deals but the key is buying in a solid neighborhood where there are fewer homes on the market
5980399 banks are now gathering together hundreds of properties and holding old style auctions to get the houses off the market

5980408 according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of the american psychiatric association often referred to simply as

5980410 virtually every book or pamphlet lay or professional published in the last 25 years on the manifestations of alcoholism has presented the jellinekian phases as unchallenged fact
5980411 the most comprehensive and clear cut ordering of characteristic experiences of alcoholics
5980412 how the beliefs of people about alcohol and alcohol consumers influence the assumptions about etiology
5980413 has been the standard textbook description of the alcoholism process it has essentially gone unchallenged until recently
5980414 well along in the course of alcoholism rather than at an early stage
5980415 despite jellineks regard for the right of the individual drinker his conceptions appear to have been subtly influenced by the protestant ethic his phases of alcohol addiction with its orderly and inferentially irreversible progression of malign symptoms through the prealcoholic phase the prodromal phase the crucial phase and finally the chronic stage is of a piece with hogarths famous illustration of a drunkards progress on the downward path to perdition while jellinek does not say that the phases of alcohol addiction always occur in the same order his vivid descriptions of the progress of alcoholism are so well attuned to the values of the middle class western physician and welfare worker that his cautions are largely overlooked by those who apply his conceptions and by the many writers who repeat his early concepts
5980416 every major tenet of the disease view of addiction is refuted by both research and everyday observation
5980417 theres no such thing as a genetic cause of alcoholism
5980418 the best predictors of alcoholism are all psychosocial factors who you hang out with whether you have a job the whole genetic argument is misguided and unjustified

5980453 urinary arsenic reflects exposures from all routes air water and food which makes it difficult to track the actual source of arsenic exposure let alone use the results from this study to establish drinking water standards
5980454 its good news and were going to definitely pat ourselves on the back because of it
5980455 but its a long haul and weve got a long way to go
5980456 its not up substantially but it is up which is always a good thing
5980457 most anybody when they leave their country their first choice would be to go back home if they could
5980458 if you look at these groups coming here theyre among the most unlikely to go back and those having the most trouble
5980459 because we have the arabic speaking community and new jersey has a lot of diversity we do get them here
5980460 france is resolved to pursue the battle against terrorism for democracy and freedom the cause is just and it is to the credit of france and its armed forces to defend it
5980461 the problem is not the number of soldiers but the mission they are sent on
5980462 this loss of life is absolutely deplorable but also could be anticipated when you have forces that enter an environment where their role is counter insurgency not peacekeeping or reconstruction
5980463 this is the first time a large number of foreign soldiers have been killed in the vicinity of the capital of afghanistan
5980464 last year all the big cities like kabul and kandahar were not under threat
5980465 but this year in kandahar many big attacks have happened
5980466 the taliban announced their intentions at the end of last year to aim to make access to the capital more difficult
5980467 and its strategic purpose is that it grabs a lot more international attention than just some far flung district and it makes life more difficult for ordinary citizens as well as the logistics of the military
5980468 we in canada have understood over the past several years how difficult this mission is
5980469 it came in through all three doors that i have
5980470 he just got out of surgery had his triple bypass and is resting comfortably
5980471 we are most grateful for all of the prayers and support we have received
5980472 he came over for a couple of weeks a couple of years ago
5980473 i was glad he did it it was kind of an honor for us
5980474 he could run the bases he could hit for average he could hit for power he could hit your best pitch and he could hit your worst pitch i just tried to keep the ball in the ballpark against him sometimes it worked sometimes it didnt
5980475 i dont think he became the most talented of the hall of famers but no one outworked him
5980476 up until the day he retired he wanted to be the best he spent hours and hours and hours hitting
5980477 there cannot be a dividing line across europe as there was in the time of the cold war
5980478 the future of our relations with russia will depend on the concrete actions russia will take
5980479 as long as russian forces are occupying a part of georgia i cannot see a russia nato council convening
5980480 russia has made it pretty clear its not that anxious to improve co operation with nato so if nato suspends talks thats unlikely to have much leverage
5980481 the view from russia is that international law and international organizations such as nato are transient phenomena of the late 20th century
5980482 what really counts as far as moscow is concerned is big powerful states using their muscle with gas and tanks
5980483 i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president without knowing necessarily what hes doing i wont have my vice president engineering my foreign policy for me
5980484 my vice president also by the way will be a member of the executive branch he wont be one of these fourth branches of the government where he thinks hes above the law
5980485 this is the oldest identification of fingerprints by post mortem remains
5980486 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5980487 sensitivity to this belief will promote development of a trusting relationship
5980488 you cant say thats nonsense you have to respect that
5980489 its not that you dont want a miracle to happen its just that its not going to happen today with this patient
5980490 i dont know its still seven days away so well see
5980491 sometimes he loses feel and just misses on pitches part of him is still harnessing who he is at all times i think that when hes able to do that those situations will be less sometimes he could be way off sometimes he could be just missing its a combination
5980492 just trying to continue to solidify and simplify things because i can make things very complicated
5980493 ive had competitive at bats i went through that month and a half stretch or whatever it was where i had some pretty doggone feeble at bats but i do that to myself ive always done it just usually its not lasted that long
5980494 just get them on first and second and let him start pitching
5980495 its kind of a tightrope act sometimes but he has the ability to make pitches have some power on his fastball just a lot of men on base only two of them scored
5980496 if you have a lot of chances sooner or later somebodys going to get a hit
5980497 we know that sometimes its a little frustrating but weve got to be on our toes expect the ball to be hit to us and the pace is real slow but thats who he is
5980498 its not something that i worry about while im pitching out there but in the long run im going to hold runners and im going to let runners score
5980499 any time somethings wrong with your arm when youre a baseball player or especially a pitcher you obviously think the worst first
5980500 ive been kind of reassured by people that its not serious
5980501 at some point in time just got to figure out what the heck it is obviously its not what i want but i think at this juncture its something that needs to happen obviously theres something going on
5980502 youve got to figure out what the heck it is you dont want it to get so bad to where it ends up being a really bad problem
5980503 no i havent im not a big fan of those arthrograms i think they cause a lot of unneeded soreness if it gets to that point well do what we need to do i dont think thats what it is
5980504 because of the arm problem he threw the ball well but he didnt locate
5980505 we really want him to go through his five day cycle day one day two day three so just to be cautious we had him not throw a ball for a few days well wait he may pick up the ball tomorrow maybe thursday play catch
5980506 its funny cause somebody asked me if he was healthy i dont want to lie i kind of alluded to the fact that he wouldnt make excuses cause he said this has nothing to do with the way i pitched it probably did but it wasnt also something i think we were real worried about
5980507 i dont know its still seven days away so well see
5980508 i checked my swing i was running down to first and i just looked up
5980509 alfonso kind of took a swing himself like thats how i swung kind of showed me up and i didnt really appreciate that i grounded out and just running back to the dugout said some things and he just threw me out no big deal it was stupid on my part to get thrown out we already took sean casey out of the game so ill learn from it
5980510 at some point in time just got to figure out what the heck it is obviously its not what i want but at this juncture something needs to happen obviously theres something going on
5980511 thats why around baseball many of us think the red sox still are the most talented team and the deepest team
5980512 just get them on first and second and let him start pitching
5980513 its kind of a tightrope act sometimes but he has the ability to make pitches have some power on his fastball just a lot of men on base only two of them scored
5980514 the surgery was a complete success and hes resting comfortably
5980515 carl had gotten through the emotional turmoil of the deaths and he also had lost about 20 pounds
5980516 i dont think he was the most talented of all hall of famers but nobody outworked him
5980517 he was crying like a little baby after that game
5980518 he knew he was getting close to the end of his career
5980519 he has become like a second father to my son since mike died
5980520 his family is most grateful for all the prayers and support they have received
5980521 the race doesnt always belong to the swift nor the battle to the strong
5980522 it belongs rather to those who run the race who stay the course and who fight the good fight
5980523 so far its going good we have power and everything its just been windy and rainy
5980524 whether i allow hits or i allow walks i always think that the important thing is not to allow the runners to score
5980525 thats the way i thought last year and its still the same this year
5980526 i think id like to reach 15 wins every year if possible
5980527 he finds a way to win thats all you can ask from a starting pitcher
5980528 hes not giving in and we know that sometimes its frustrating but it keeps you on your toes
5980529 i havent had results but ive been swinging the bat over the past two weeks three weeks
5980530 because i hit a homer doesnt make the difference but i think all that other stuff was just compiling ive returned more to normal since the all star break than i was before that
5980531 i was just trying to go up there and throw strikes they take a lot of pitches maybe thats why theyre so good
5980532 we had some opportunities and matsuzaka made some big pitches and got out of them
5980533 but we hung in there the best we could when your teams playing good everything seems to go your way and when its not going your way it seems like guys out in the field got extra gloves on
5980534 we had the right guys up there and it didnt happen
5980535 now that you said it i think someones going to get that hit
5980536 it doesnt matter whether the bases are loaded or not my job is to not allow the runners to score if theres a base empty of course its a little easier but its not something i worry about
5980537 mom this rain is really weird its just coming down straight not sideways
5980538 were going to have to work together to make it the best place it can be
5980539 its been a fixture with the kids for a number of years
5980540 you cant just go to wal mart and buy one
5980541 im hoping someone will just leave it somewhere or send a note telling me where it is wed love to have him back
5980542 was unable to provide assurances that shed be able to protect the child in the future
5980543 i came to tell you that the work that you are doing here is essential
5980544 the best way to be loyal to your comrades is to continue your work is to raise your head to be professional
5980545 i have no doubt that we must be here i am also in shock but i tell you in good conscience that if we had to do it again i would do it again
5980546 not the patrol and the sequence of events but the choice which led me to confirm the decision of my predecessors to send the french army here
5980547 why are we here it is because here we play a part in the freedom of the the world here we are fighting against terrorism
5980548 jade had some tests recently then she went off to india to appear in the indian big brother

5980555 the eu committed to bind and eliminate duties on ita products in its wto tariff schedules
5980556 we believe that these duties are inconsistent with the eus commitments on these products and that they discourage technological innovation in the it sector

5980584 the lease will be a revenue generator for the prpa and were keeping all the vendors together 1 100 people who work there and thousands of truckers who run through there delivering food across the region and as the state of the art facility theyll attract new shipping and vendors that benefits the region and the support community
5980585 any toll increase or gasoline tax will only be for transportation
5980586 i dont think were going to do any debt reduction for a while
5980587 considering all options as we work to consider a funding solution for transportation
5980588 its not a popular issue these days why do you think politicians in the past like whitman and mcgreevey increased the debt because the public doesnt care about it
5980589 not a herculean step were not claiming weve solved every problem the idea is that we make these kinds of choices on a regular basis about how we budget and manage our finances we will get ourselves back into a strong position
5980590 each day you get closer to election day 2009 it makes it tougher and tougher to deal with these complicated issues
5980591 since these estimates have a small margin of error are leading indicators of future housing activity and are not influenced by weather nearly as much as starts
5980592 but they also hint at a possible rebound late this year
5980593 starts will continue to fall through the end of the year likely hitting a 50 year low
5980594 the good news is that the lower construction will soon cut into the mountain of inventory weighing on the housing market
5980595 the real issue is not what the one month low will be but when will activity simply stabilize
5980596 were trying to minimize the impact on people but its not easy because the work is invasive
5980597 i havent been able to get to my street for a month
5980598 this is such a big player in the regional economy this is the workhorse to know that its strong and vital thats a big deal
5980599 which bodes well for philadelphias international service and wed like to begin more service to europe and to the middle east and asia in the coming years
5980600 announcing our first service to the middle east is the perfect follow up to our london heathrow service which began in march
5980601 we appreciate us airways commitment to enhancing our citys economy and culture with this new service we look forward to working with us airways to further establish philadelphia as a major international gateway
5980602 you might be wondering why starting tel aviv is any different in an environment where fuel is costly
5980603 china is a developing international market from the united states whereas tel aviv is very established and we absolutely know that our tel aviv service has better economics
5980604 i have great confidence in both individuals to carry out this agenda and meet the challenges ive outlined
5980605 has called the integrity of members into question on many occasions and acted as a pr firm for the administration
5980606 the best way to achieve cost efficient reductions is to put markets to work to that end rather than the regulatory approach said biden
5980607 with the closing of the financing we are excited to restart construction immediately and build and operate a world class facility of which pittsburghers can be proud
5980608 we dont expect to recover additional money in the near term as a result of this order
5980609 we are making efforts to have him returned to the united states
5980610 i dont believe well be more than 90 million over in the end i do not think it will be delayed
5980611 im afraid that with the price of steel and all the things that go into construction the bids will blow by that
5980612 if it gets to a point where we cant afford it weve simply got to pull the plug on it
5980613 if the bids come in and are way over it does not appear to me we can go forward
5980614 i cant answer why he rendell said what he said at the end of the day there will be a convention center expansion there will be casinos built theres too much invested for this not to happen
5980615 i dont know why the governor said what he said it will be a tremendous benefit to the city the region and the state it is my expectation that the project will move forward the building will get built and we will have a spectacular convention center expansion
5980616 everything is much more expensive than it used to be steel is noticeably in the forefront of that
5980617 a lot of owners both public and private are rethinking their projects
5980618 part of it is the chinese buying so much part of it is a slowdown of the auto manufacturers not producing as much scrap
5980619 we couldnt get much more than 790 million from the state and the city combined thats no 1 where can we find the money
5980620 my job is to get this thing done and we are going to get it done
5980621 mayor nutter is 1 000 percent for it hes not going to let this fall through the cracks not when you are looking a gift horse in the mouth of 700 million
5980622 ive always cooked since i was little stuff like cookies and desserts its just something i always did with my mom
5980623 i got tired of always cleaning up the kitchen because thats the rule in our house mom usually cooks although my dad is a really good cook too and whoever doesnt cook has to clean up i told my mom that i wanted to cook instead of clean so she told me that i had to do the whole thing pick out a recipe shop for the ingredients and make it too
5980624 so i just started looking through my moms recipe books
5980625 when im not cooking i like hanging out with my friends going shopping and scuba diving i also play lacrosse and field hockey

5980638 you go into some of these small towns in pennsylvania and like a lot of small towns in the midwest the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothings replaced them and they fell through the clinton administration and the bush administration and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not and its not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations

5980645 hi ms aidoo im a big fan of your writing what brings you to harare
5980646 oh thank you i am here with my daughter to focus on my writing
5980647 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
5980648 a police officer of seven years on medical leave labelled as a hero for being wounded in the line of duty got up in front of the world and told the world of how he and mr dyer uncovered this creature
5980649 on august 16 the freezer containing the alleged corpse arrived with the searching for bigfoot team
5980650 the ice was being thawed slowly without aid to prevent any decomposition of the alleged corpse we estimated that the freezer and its contents weighed over 1 500lbs and it would take several days or longer to thaw completely
5980651 the following day we were up early to discover that some hair was now exposed i extracted some from the alleged corpse examined it and had some concerns
5980652 we began an expedited melting process within one hour we were able to see the partially exposed head i was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm but unusually hollow in one small section this was yet another ominous sign
5980653 within the next hour of thaw a break appeared up near the feet area as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
5980654 later that day we were informed that mr whitton and mr dyer had admitted it was a costume
5980655 officials concerned are working through the process of putting him on the plane to take him out of the country but if he continues to refuse to leave then he will confined in the airport transit area temporarily before being taken into a detention centre
5980656 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again
5980657 i dont want any sex offenders in this country but the point is vietnamese officials have deported him to the uk so as we do whenever sex offenders return to this country we need to plan for what happens when people return
5980658 never mind his individual case anybody who is returning to the uk in these sorts of circumstances would be met at the airport by police officers would be served with an order which effectively puts them on to the sex offenders register
5980659 one of the things we have learned generally about sex offenders is they do want to travel to places where they can exploit children
5980660 if there is evidence the person is travelling abroad to abuse children we can get an order that stops them travelling there should be more of those
5980661 in every single case the court has to make the decision but this is the type of case where i find it pretty hard to imagine it is legitimate for him to travel abroad again
5980662 i think its right that we use police time to monitor sex offenders
5980663 if you are a british citizen you have the right to use the nhs whatever we think about an individual and this is a pretty despicable person
5980664 the last information we have is that shortly before the flight to the uk departed he declined to board
5980665 he decides where he applies to go and the country or authorities there will decide whether they permit him to enter their territory
5980666 i knew i had to fight from behind in the race i may not be fast but i can fight

5980688 wenn wir sozialdemokraten in hessen eine minderheitsregierung zustande bringen und diese regierung ordentlich arbeitet dann sehe ich nicht wo der schaden f r die bundespartei sein soll

5980690 so etwas geht schon unter die haut was da getrieben wird ist teilweise wirklich hysterisch

5980695 man guckt den leuten auf die stirn nichts ins hirn
5980696 south africa are similar to brazil in the way they play my players treat the ball with love and care
5980697 thats why we play football i would never want to play the way australia play my players dont have those characteristics
5980698 we have to keep working in training and in the last three games you saw that we scored three goals
5980699 its not bad for a young team and we should look positively at what we need to do to put the ball in the back of the net
5980700 it will take a time and hopefully the boys are slowly picking things up
5980701 we will give our best i know my boys they are fighters they never lie down until the final whistle
5980702 attitude is very important and they have great fighting spirit and aggression
5980703 if we make it to the final it will be an added bonus
5980704 its never good to go quite a while without getting points
5980705 we have not been getting some points but we lost against some of the top teams and the positive thing is that we completed those matches well
5980706 against the young lions as well we should have got something and albirex it was a good game to watch both teams played attractive attacking football but we looked a little tired
5980707 we lost 1 0 to home united but we could have got something out of the game it was a matter of if and when if the goalpost had been a bit bigger
5980708 we didnt have a game for three weeks and then we had two games in three days so i think that cost us a bit we looked a little bit off the pace
5980709 against albirex we looked okay and looking at all the games football wise if some things had fallen our way we might have got a few more points
5980710 its encouraging that we still had a shot at getting more points but thats in the past we must look forward
5980711 if youre in the semi finals the chances of getting into the final are 50 50 its a two legged tie weve got to take it over two legs
5980712 people tell me its the first time the young lions are in the semi final but i dont buy that if theyre in the s league theyll want to get in the final as much as we do
5980713 the first game is at woodlands so well try to build the pace

5980746 those insulated lunch bags work great to keep makeup and even things such as sunscreen fresh
5980747 you can add some ice packs to help insulate it even more when you come home if your makeup has been left outside or in a car all day throw it in the refrigerator overnight
5980748 go and eat breakfast or iron your clothes and then come back and try to put on your makeup

5980750 i love estee lauders double wear foundations during the summertime and i apply them using a foundation brush a foundation brush provides an even finish and helps avoid putting on too much foundation wearing excess makeup will look obvious in hot humid climates
5980751 use a peachy blush a little mascara some eye liner and a pop of color on the lips
5980752 switch from liquid foundation which melts and shines and runs in the heat because of the oil in it to a powder foundation such as mac studio fix or a mineral pressed powder
5980753 or sephora makes a nice bronzer that works great in the heat
5980754 it acts like a glue between the lid and the eye shadow or sometimes i use a waterproof eyeliner across my entire eyelid and then put the shadow on top
5980755 you apply it with a cotton ball and it is clear liquid and you put it on freshly cleansed skin let it dry and then apply makeup over it it helps keep down perspiration

5980763 zo krijgen we een beeld van hoe de ondergrond in noordoost limburg is samengesteld
5980764 uit het onderzoek van vorig jaar bleek dat er effectief pakketten van zandsteen in de ondergrond zitten
5980765 in theorie wisten we dat natuurlijk wel uit geologische modellen sommige dateren zelfs uit begin vorige eeuw maar we wilden het ook controleren die zandsteen is poreus en slaat makkelijk gas op soms lagen die pakketten precies waar we die verwachtten soms niet met de elektrische metingen willen we alles nog eens extra controleren
5980766 op basis van de trillingen deze metingen en oude boringen bekijken we dan of we verder willen gaan of niet zo ja zullen we boren dan gaan we 1 500 2 000 meter diep de boortoren zal zon 35 meter hoog zijn dat deel van het onderzoek zal nog eens zon 18 maanden duren als blijkt dat ook dit positief is dan zijn we nog bezig tot 2014 op dit moment kunnen we dus echt nog niet zeggen of die gasopslag zal lukken of niet

5980781 new drilling has to be part of our energy solution
5980782 it will not solve this problem alone alternative energy will not solve this problem alone conservation will not solve this problem alone solving our energy crisis requires an all of the above approach it will require aggressive development of alternative energies like wind solar tidal and biofuels it also requires expanding traditional sources of energy like clean coal nuclear power and offshore drilling like that done on this rig

5980785 when you are in the work environment the product you are selling is yourself the packaging display and the merchandising of that product is enormously important

5980801 the all blacks have some great tactical kickers so in a sense we had to slow the game down last week the aussies dont have great tactical kickers and we have to speed things up thats why weve gone with jantjes
5980802 they the boks have been playing an attacking expansive type of game and i think theyll keep going with that
5980803 it is up to us to make sure we are on our game with our defensive policies and that sort of thing
5980804 if there is any opportunity for turnovers or things like that we can hopefully sting them back with these new elvs it certainly creates a lot more opportunity at fullback in terms of counter attack and turnover ball and getting your hands on the ball as much as you can

5980816 the glue that was holding the coalition partners together was mr musharraf now that punching bag has gone
5980817 the only thing thats a surprise is how quickly it has happened after musharraf left theyve hardly had time to savor their victory
5980818 the coalition may not continue if the judges are not restored
5980819 if elections are held i dont think the peoples party can survive it will be wiped out
5980820 if they dont settle it then we could review our strategy and relations with the government all options will be open
5980821 the army wants to be neutral now they want to be out of politics and i dont see them playing a role in the near future
5980822 theyre not coming back tomorrow but if the situation gets worse and you begin to hear a public clamor for something to be done because the coalition government is in paralysis and the country is spiraling downwards then all bets are off
5980823 when most of us think of a home gym we think of big metal pieces of equipment treadmills and weight machines
5980824 but you dont need that to get a good workout you can get a good workout at home with some simple inexpensive lightweight materials
5980825 you want to think about strength training you need something to add resistance and a body bar is a great tool to do that
5980826 its just a padded bar and it comes in a few different weight ranges
5980827 if you have carpeting in your apartment just a little square of carpeting you can put one under your hand and one hand on the carpet and use them to do push ups and push out when you do them
5980828 you can stand on one with one leg when youre doing lunges to side
5980829 you can stand on the exerdisk when youre doing any kind of exercise and instantly your whole core has to work harder to support you
5980830 you hold it in your hands while jumping as if you were jumping rope and it even makes the sound effect of jumping rope but you dont need the rope swinging above your head
5980831 a great way to think when you are building a home gym that you want to be storable is to think are these things i could take with me when i travel
5980832 and if they are theyre probably great for a home gym

5980842 we can go one of two ways we can establish ourselves as a progressive state thats open to using our resources to create jobs in the renewable energy market or we can go for instant gratification with coal power plants and establish ourselves as people living up to the stereotype of being backward
5980843 we need to do something bold like block the coal plant
5980844 its archaic mentality that if you bring something in it will make jobs most of the jobs they are speaking of are construction

5980887 while negotiations are continuing it may be necessary to convene parliament to give effect to the will of the people as expressed in the parliamentary elections held on the 29th of march 2008
5980888 the gap between the parties is narrower points of disagreement are not so wide the parties still are far from each other though on one point and that is the executive powers that should go to the president and the prime minister that is the stumbling block

5980894 every response weve had to the proposal so far has been really positive we are nearing the end of the consultation process but there is still time to tell us what you think about reclassification proposal from our point of view we are keen to protect the native wild fish population but there is also potential benefit here for local angling businesses who will be able to market themselves to the niche market of wild trout fishing
5980895 we cant for the life of us work out why they do it
5980896 were doing systematic observations now to determine if theres something that may trigger it but so far we havent found anything
5980897 this indicates that they do learn from each other which is not a surprise really but it does also seem that they exhibit elements of what in humans we would call cultural behaviour
5980898 these are things that groups develop and are passed between individuals and that come to define those groups such as language or dancing and it would seem that among the port river dolphins we may have an incipient tail walking culture
5980899 getting from the north to the south of the site used to be slow and painstaking but the bridge will make it a delight
5980900 as the world flips over from a predominantly rural to a predominantly urban population base cities are going to take more and more water for agriculture
5980901 however most of the water going into urban areas comes out the other end in the sewers
5980902 we know that there is an informal sector within many cities that is using wastewater to grow vegetables but there has been no data on how much of this water was being used or what the risks were
5980903 it is a pretty useful way of treating water in the sense that if the water just went straight into a river it would cause a lot more eutrophication problems further downstream
5980904 so in a way it is performing an ecological service by cleaning up some of the water and recycling the nutrients
5980905 if this practice is going to be increasingly commonplace and more and more people are going to be eating food produced this way then there needs to be a bit more concern about the heavy metals and other contaminants in there
5980906 ideally the end product should be treating the water to a standard that means there is no risk but most developing nations cannot afford to do this
5980907 apparently what happens now in areas with very polluted water is that the farmers do a smell test or a taste test
5980908 if the water tastes too foul or smells too bad then they wont use it to irrigate their crops but thats a pretty dangerous way to go about things
5980909 it is really just about minimising the risks from field to fork with a series of simple measures
5980910 these include letting the water settle in a pond so a lot of the eggs from worms drop out of the water and irrigating around the crops rather than on top of them
5980911 when the crop is harvested it also needs to be washed with fresh clean water in the market and that water needs to be constantly changed so everything else is not contaminated
5980912 sustainable businesses offer products and services that fulfil societys needs while contributing to the well being of all earths inhabitants

5980918 every year a network of 500 bto volunteers monitor 30 000 nests providing an enormous wealth of information about the changes in nesting activities of many of our birds over time this body of information reveals a fascinating insight into how wildlife is affected by environmental changes
5980919 this years report shows that climate change is with us already and from our gardens to our seas birds are having to respond rapidly to climate change simply to survive as often before birds are acting like the canaries in a mine shaft and giving us early warning of dangerous change
5980920 the consistent declines in specialist bird species highlighted by this years report indicate that the variety and richness of our countryside is being lost this reflects the findings of natural englands own state of the natural environment report this loss is affecting many plants and animals we urgently need to act to reverse the loss and fragmentation of important habitats if our wildlife is to stand any chance of adapting to climate change
5980921 the rate of redistribution of some waterbirds has been dramatic in recent years but for some species we still know little about the extent to which decreases in numbers in the uk are due to redistribution to other parts of their range or real decreases in overall numbers it is vital that we learn more about the extent and consequences of redistribution in order to ensure that these species are effectively conserved
5980922 this report highlights continuing problems for scottish seabirds such as guillemots puffins and kittiwakes there have been further declines in breeding success in 2007 as shown by the new scottish seabird indicator
5980923 we know that this is almost certainly due to lower food availability principally sandeels we are also aware that changes in sandeel abundance are probably linked to climate change in the seas around the scottish coastline sadly these changes in productivity are likely to mean fewer breeding birds and therefore continued decline in some key species that are so emblematic of scotlands marine environment
5980924 this decrease of certain waders such as dunlin and ringed plover is also reflected in the welsh wintering populations
5980925 climate change also seems to be affecting the pied flycatcher an archetypal bird of welsh oak woodlands they appear to be breeding earlier across a number of sites and the worry is they may eventually breed so early they are out of sync with their major food source of caterpillars
5980926 we are concerned about the dramatic reduction in overall duck numbers wintering on lough neagh the uks largest lake we are funding some research to see if certain species are short stopping in europe because there are ice free water bodies that would have been ice bound before climate change

5980953 the 60s and 70s were an exciting time in the music industry and its a pleasure to record these artists using 21st century technology so their fans can enjoy their classic hits with todays quality

5981029 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5981030 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5981031 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5981032 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5981033 a survey of 4 000 students in primary and secondary schools in singapore showed that some 95 percent of them have experienced bullying at school
5981034 the most urgent need in the christian church today is true preaching
5981035 what is it that always heralds the dawn of a reformation or of a revival it is renewed preaching
5981036 if people can listen to us without becoming anxious about themselves or reflecting on themselves we have not been preaching
5981037 what is the chief end of preaching it is to give men and women a sense of god and his presence
5981038 what is the rule then it is be natural forget yourself be so absorbed in what you are doing and in the realization of the presence of god and in the glory and the greatness of the truth that you are preaching and the occasion that brings you together that you are so taken up by all this that you forget yourself completely that is the right condition that is the only place of safety that is the only way in which you can honour god self is the greatest enemy of the preacher more so than in the case of any other man in society and the only way to deal with self is to be so taken up with and so enraptured by the glory of what you are doing that you forget yourself altogether
5981039 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5981040 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5981041 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5981042 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5981043 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5981044 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5981045 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5981046 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5981047 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5981048 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5981049 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5981050 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5981051 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5981052 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5981053 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5981054 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5981055 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5981056 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5981057 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5981058 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5981059 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5981060 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5981061 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5981062 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5981063 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5981064 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5981065 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
5981066 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
5981067 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
5981068 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
5981069 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5981070 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5981071 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5981072 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5981073 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5981074 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5981075 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5981076 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5981077 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5981078 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5981079 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

5981081 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5981082 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5981083 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5981084 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5981085 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5981086 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5981087 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5981088 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5981089 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5981090 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5981091 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5981092 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5981093 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5981094 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5981095 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5981096 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5981097 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5981098 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5981099 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5981100 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5981101 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
5981102 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
5981103 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
5981104 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
5981105 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
5981106 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
5981107 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
5981108 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
5981109 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
5981110 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
5981111 renowned for her managerial skill the discipline she demands from those around her and her tight control of all things labour undertakes under her leadership
5981112 she holds generally left wing beliefs with foreign policy perspectives forged during the vietnam war she does not trust those outside a small circle in labour and her chief of staff heather simpson is known as the second most powerful person in nz known as h2 the notes say
5981113 the department of foreign affairs and trade very much regrets the circulation of the biography by the australian high commission in wellington of an outdated internal draft which was a mistake dfat said in a statement
5981114 commissioner john dauth has apologised to ms clark who has accepted the apology
5981115 ms clark has said publicly she regarded the incident as a pretty minor thing and she had had a bit of a laugh
5981116 newly formed governing arrangements with nz first and united future which happened soon after the 2005 new zealand election
5981117 i am a bit surprised that dfat would draw up something that was clearly written about the time of the last election there you go maybe they need to be more efficient miss clark said
5981118 i think it is a pretty minor thing i had a bit of a laugh
5981119 i thought it was a hoot and i dont propose to release the one i have on mr rudd costume caper
5981120 they can bring their laptops so they can access the internet or social networking sites and they can also bring their phones to phone whoever they have set up to talk to
5981121 some girls looked up rhyming sites and some i suppose phoned for suggestions reflection on what they were doing and some simply wrote it pen and paper
5981122 for the first one we had to write the sonnet i looked up you know rhyming words and i used dictionaries and thesauruses and things like that to help me really explain what i was thinking
5981123 i also text messaged my dad who used to be an english teacher who really gave me some ideas on what kinds of things were associated with sonnets in the tasks that we given
5981124 i found it really difficult to prepare because i had so many choices in front of me calling on the internet or using my laptop or just writing on pen and paper
5981125 we are looking at assessment tasks that actually hone their skills in finding information assessing the reliability of the information and then citing it correctly so they are not involved in plagiarism and understand the difference between that and how they have to manipulate that information in an assessment task using higher order thinking skills to answer the questions
5981126 computers and the internet and other digital resources are now routinely used in schools and classrooms
5981127 students are encouraged from primary school onwards to make very active use of those resources and tools yet when it comes to teaching when it comes to assessments and grading
5981128 i think in principal its high time that we started seriously thinking about of the assessment and what it means using technical and knowledge resources that come for instance with the internet
5981129 well i dont know what i am doing but i think i will try
5981130 hes a quick healer and he really wants to get back into action he should be all right for the cup tie
5981131 with five players making debuts including zac jones we had a largely new team
5981132 there were plenty of positives about the game and we will get better
5981133 trafford were dangerous on the break and i was delighted with a point i know we still need a stronger cutting edge but we could have had more goals
5981134 eww thats nasty i have never ever hooked up with michael phelps come on i have really good taste hes really not my type we dont even talk to each other
5981135 im not dating amanda beard ill say that i think she has a boyfriend
5981136 i would not consider frosted flakes the food of an olympian
5981137 i would rather see him promoting fiber one i would rather see him promoting oatmeal i would even rather see him promoting cheerios
5981138 for a guy like michael phelps who isnt worried about obesity because hes burning thousands of calories as an athlete eating corn flakes and frosted flakes every so often is not an issue
5981139 there is a major discrepancy in the two urine samples of asif which came out positive and in such cases the player has a chance to be cleared
5981140 this is a lot of difference and im sure if his lawyer pursues the case asif has a chance to come out clean
5981141 we will appeal to the ipl drug tribunal and point out the difference in the test results
5981142 the ipl drug tribunal comprises former indian test captain sunil gavaskar dr ravi bapat and lawyer shirish gupte
5981143 i still remember that an indian gold medalist athlete sunita rani had a similar case of varied readings at the busan asian games in 2002 and she won her case at the cas
5981144 the children were not living in the bin but had been using it as a cubby house and the car park as a play area
5981145 docs caseworkers are assessing if there are any ongoing concerns about the welfare of the children
5981146 thats if its mother comes back its adopted by another pod or if we rear it in captivity
5981147 if you had the 30 million litre tank and the 30 people like they did in america then maybe
5981148 they did it with a smaller whale for a lesser period of time
5981149 we have considered all possibilities and exhausted all possible rescue scenarios and along with other experts in the field we agree the animals suffering should not be prolonged and advocate for a humane outcome
5981150 people have been fantastic at suggesting things a lot of things that arent doable
5981151 the best thing that can happen is that if it joins another pod of whales and theres a female there that can look after it
5981152 a lot of people from agricultural backgrounds are familiar with feeding animals artificially
5981153 its just not that simple we know that cows milk for example is toxic to kangaroos
5981154 the blood sample will really indicate where the whale is at in terms of its general condition
5981155 excessive caloric expenditure has limited implications for substantially reducing body weight independent of nutritional modifications
5981156 we get a tremendous amount of pressure to eat for reasons other than nurturing ourselves and over time people lose sensitivity to hunger fullness appetite signals meant to keep them healthy and well nourished its hard for people to come to a healthy sense of themselves given the cultural climate and nutritious and pleasurable options for healthy food are not as easily accessible as less nutritious
5981157 kids are going to drink whether its legal or illegal
5981158 wed at least be able to have a more open dialogue with students about drinking as opposed to this sham where people dont want to talk about it because its a violation of the law
5981159 sometimes you just have to admit that you didnt do your homework as well as you might have thought
5981160 this is really good news it was more than i expected
5981161 at that time the national park service had a somewhat different philosophy about where to place visitors centers it was to put them as close as possible to historic resources
5981162 had the expansion gone forward that would be the issue it would be a bigger blemish
5981163 in these uncertain times we are committed to helping our existing customers who are about to come to the end of their current deal
5981164 we have introduced these new competitive rates to support customers who want to keep monthly repayments as affordable as possible
5981165 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5981166 more than 212 000 metric tons 235 000 tons of food is lost to hypoxia in the gulf of mexico
5981167 thats enough to feed 75 percent of the average brown shrimp harvest from the louisiana gulf if there was no hypoxia and there was that much more food dont you think the shrimp and crabs would be happier they would certainly be fatter
5981168 the primary culprit in marine environments is nitrogen and nowadays the biggest contributor of nitrogen to marine systems is agriculture its the same scenario all over the world
5981169 farmers are not doing it on purpose theyd prefer to have it stick on the land
5981170 nitrogen is very slippery its very difficult to keep it on land
5981171 we need to find a technology to keep nitrogen from leaving the soil
5981172 its possible for nue crops to produce the same yield with half as much fertilizer
5981173 its a big economic benefit for farmers if they use only half as much nitrogen as well a big beneficial impact on nitrogen runoff into waterways
5981174 a reasonable expectation is that there would be a dramatic reduction maybe by 2018
5981175 if you look at agricultural ponds you can aerate them to prevent low oxygen
5981176 but thats a pond were talking about open systems with tides the water doesnt just stay there

5981191 so this was the choice i made and it was a tough one
5981192 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really like you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes
5981193 and i think thats its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to
5981194 i love living and i really love my life and i knew that from this moment on it was only going to be good that was going to be coming
5981195 this storm is going to be with us for a while

5981215 it is a cause for regret that at a time when we are already in a difficult situation the american side further exacerbates the situation in relations between the united states and russia
5981216 for that reason no one who has good intentions towards us and towards the western world should be afraid of it

5981219 wimax has gained such momentum across so many regions that it is no longer sensible to suggest that wimax growth will be flattened by the emergence of lte in the next few years in populous countries with poor national telecom infrastructure such as india brazil and africa there is a lack of broadband services and even of basic voice services which is a significant driver for wimax adoption in many developing countries with india being the prime example wimax is showing promising signs of becoming the primary broadband infrastructure and a prominent 3g mobile technology india is absolutely critical to the fortunes of wimax and the level of uptake there will help decide how prominent a position 802 16e takes in the overall wireless landscape in the next decade
5981220 we understand the desire of st to call our 20 percent stake in order to expand the st nxp wireless joint venture with ericsson we support this next step that ericsson and st are taking to create the global leader in wireless semiconductors to help ensure the success of the joint venture going forward all nxps supply and support agreements will continue as planned the additional proceeds of the 20 percent stake will enable nxp to further build leadership positions through innovation and investment in nxps core businesses
5981221 by combining the complementary strengths and product offerings of ericsson and st in platforms and semiconductors the joint venture is well positioned to become a world leader
5981222 the industry continues to develop at a swift pace and customers see benefits from our broad offering this partnership is a perfect fit and secures a complete offering as well as the necessary scale for technology leadership
5981223 we now aim to carry out more work in this area to develop a prognostic tool which we hope will eventually be for widespread use by the health services in the treatment of bowel cancer
5981224 the problem is identifying which cancers need which treatments this discovery may show us the way to do that and help save a lot of lives
5981225 its a strong belief among many republicans that its not the way to go
5981226 its a core belief that we have we stick with our core beliefs

5981229 w rtsil s proven technology enables the transition to a more sustainable and modern energy infrastructure in india the new state of the art manufacturing facility will work with the latest technology and semi automation principle where skilled manpower and modern manufacturing methods will both have equal opportunity
5981230 this is the only facility manufacturing auxiliary modules owned by w rtsil the rest of the supplies are through vendors in europe we continuously aim to improve the quality of our products and this has been our great focus area at the khopoli plant cost competitiveness has been achieved by applying multiple skills and improving productivity we are very positive that the new set up will help our colleagues at w rtsil boost the efficiency of project execution
5981231 competitive cost and quality helped us win export markets but the unit in khopoli had reached a stage where the existing manufacturing facility was inadequate to cater to the demand with this expansion w rtsil india is now poised for a big leap in the export market with the inauguration of its new facility

5981236 have you lost your mind i mean how is it that you can disrespect a mans ethnicity when you know weve influenced nearly every facet of white america from our music to our style of dress not to mention your basic imitation of our sense of cool walk talk dress mannerisms we enrich your very existence all the while contributing to the gross national product through our achievements in corporate america its these conceits that comfort me when i am faced with the ignorant cowardly bitter and bigoted who have no talent no guts people like you who desecrate things they dont understand when the truth is you should say thank you and go on about your way but apparently you are incapable of doing that

5981243 we face as a country economic challenges some of these we face in common with the western world
5981244 we also face a situation where our determination over macroeconomic policy is extremely limited nonetheless i think its right and proper that the commits itself to focus on efforts towards a single overarching purpose of increasing sustainable economic growth in scotland
5981245 more than that i want to restate a basic contention of the government that there is every reason to be confident in the future of the scottish economy our workforce and businesses and this countrys ability to define and seize new economic opportunities
5981246 other people right now see scotland not as backmarkers but as frontrunners
5981247 the old lobbying culture is giving way in my opinion to a more open flexible democratic chamber based on multiple coalitions of ideas and aspirations
5981248 in short across the whole of society scotland is moving forward whatever the short term smoke of difficulties in the economy
5981249 we welcome the new confident nation we are proud to serve it thanks to the work of the democratic pioneers such as donald dewar whatever the constitutional configuration of our country we can stand the opportunity to be one of the true successes of the 21st century
5981250 in central fife i can promise you the snp will be practising hard and will be taking nothing for granted and we will be working as hard if not harder than we worked in glasgow east
5981251 i think the folk in glasgow east didnt make a mistake they knew what they were doing
5981252 i have two pieces of advice change his policies and cheer up for gods sake
5981253 it just means were starting to do things in the right way
5981254 were making less mistakes were starting to believe in what were doing it just validates the work that weve done its good but still theres a long ways to go its just nice to be there right now
5981255 i dont think weve played particularly bad in any of these games but tonight was one bad inning
5981256 we set the table for them and cracked it open further with an error and those guys capped it off with a hit we just didnt get it done late weve been doing a terrific job of that but not tonight
5981257 weve been pitching well its just at the end we cracked the door for them and let them win
5981258 its frustrating because we didnt play well enough certainly in the eighth inning theres not much more you can say about it

5981267 ive heard that the punjabiyat and sikh theme have gone against the films success in bihar but i dont understand why we were aware that some areas would reject the films usp namely the sikh ambience surprisingly the film has done extremely well even in bengal where we thought the audience wouldve trouble connecting with the theme theres really no explanation for what has happened to singh is kinng in bihar

5981270 youngsters today certainly dont talk the way they used to 20 30 years ago their vocabulary is faster and more to the point with time im sure the lines of dialogue will get even simpler
5981271 dialogue doesnt register with the audience any more because today films just run for three or four weeks it was in the 1970s and 80s that we saw the last of the great silver and golden jubilee runs
5981272 our societys lingo has changed and so has the dialogue today commercial cinema is primarily catering to the metros so forget hindustani today the language thats spoken in our movies is hinglish
5981273 now we try to write dialogue that will touch the viewers heart earlier the characters would be larger than life today relatively speaking they have become more real dialogue has to avoid bombast today and remain to the point also earlier dialogue was written keeping the actor in mind but not anymore aamir khan akshay kumar and sanjay dutt are very colloquial and casual in their dialogue delivery
5981274 jannat became a hit because of its superb songs it is said by all but how about giving the writer his due also not many know that the dialogue was written by me
5981275 in view of that likely interpretation we considered that the comparisons should include a fair and representative selection of goods

5981282 youve obviously have to have physical prowess to play at this level and from that point on its very much about how you harness your thoughts without a doubt teams have put up their own barriers
5981283 if for example you stand at the bottom of table mountain and think you cant get to the top you wont
5981284 it all comes down to what happens on the day nothing that has gone before really matters youve just got to be on the job well focus on the job at hand this saturday and not worry about the past
5981285 for us its all about maximising what we can do in a match and then select the best combination for us
5981286 thats one way you can do well in any game well just worry about getting our selections right and we wont alter that based on who is playing for south africa
5981287 we will make the most of what we got on the day but obviously a player like habana is remarkable he can do things that others cant
5981288 his absence is not something we will dwell on we will just get on with what we have to do
5981289 without the back door system we would have been more successful over the last 10 years

5981314 we have great innovation in our boys category this year with all of the new products hitting retail in the third and fourth quarters
5981315 i can count on one hand the number of people here with any kind of crop this year
5981316 but growers are the ultimate optimists hopefully well have a good crop next year
5981317 these sez are aimed at growing it and ites companies who are choosing to set up centres in adjoining area of tier i cities in view of global economic pressure to reduce costs and maximise returns
5981318 while area under cultivation has shrunk it will not have much impact on the output as more than 80 per cent of farmers have planted bt cotton this year
5981319 it can be seen as a payback in june from the building code change in new york city we may see another decline in august
5981320 this concludes a successful effort by our division of enforcement to stop fraud in its tracks return as much money as possible to defrauded investors and to bring wrongdoers to justice
5981321 inflation is more systemic than they were leading us to believe in the past numbers and it will continue to show up in the cpi number for months to come the question is whether or not investors can shake it off knowing that the price of oil has come down
5981322 the fed is stuck between a rock and a hard place and it shows
5981323 i wish i would have been better on that one pitch
5981324 we start by talking to the athletes on what it means to represent your country
5981325 thats something thats incredibly important to us we take that as sort of our beginning point theres a tremendous amount of country pride that comes with representing those countries
5981326 when we talked to our track and field athletes from the usa they said they put on these uniforms and feel like a superhero
5981327 that was a great insight to extract the creative vision of all of our apparel was the vision of a superhero
5981328 theres been very robust natural gas activity and the unlocking of some gas resources such as shale plays in texas
5981329 our storage positions for gas are returning to more normal levels there was a fear we wouldnt be able to replenish the storage
5981330 maybe in the winter when gas consumption is higher well see more

5981353 condannato alto calore servizi avellino confermata lassemblea per l 8 9 2008
5981354 ed avendo riguardo alla obbligatorieta della convocazione dellassemblea per il rinnovo del c
5981355 is to help them return to full productive lives through work
5981356 it looks to me as though people are understanding that ive been working as governor to get results all across he state
5981357 were a long ways ahead of where we were last time at this point
5981358 it doesnt really matter the bottom line is were on the general election
5981359 behind all of these claims and positions by sen obama lies the ambition to be president
5981360 the republicans have taken that first type of patriotism that muscular military rockets red glare type of patriotism and driven that as a wedge against people they see democrats liberals as weak on national security issues
5981361 i think the patriotism question in this case is being wrapped into this larger issue that hes not one of us
5981362 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5981363 it showed that hed put a campaign victory ahead of a military victory
5981364 if we think that we can use the same partisan politics where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
5981365 regardless of the parties there is a certain political intercourse that is thrown in with other broader benefits of future access and gratitude when you become a financier of the conventions
5981366 while we recognize that the steps we have taken are not perfect or even a perfect symbol they do reflect the fact that barack obama shares the urgent desire of the american people to change the way washington operates
5981367 the idea is to give our leadership a chance to be with these folks to talk about our issues and make sure that our issues are out there
5981368 you can have a cover band but you cant have a name act
5981369 you can have a string quartet but were not sure you can have a dj
5981370 what obama is creating is this army of individuals these grass roots activists who are out there trying to change the world in 160 characters or less
5981371 valuable because not everyone sits in front of a computer or a television
5981372 at getting votes on election day and communicating the messages that we feel are important to our supporters
5981373 text messaging is really powerful if i have a text message i can forward that text message to over 100 people in my cell phone list
5981374 its going to be read by every single person have you ever not read a text message
5981375 we hope sept 11th is a day when americans come together and reaffirm our resolve to address the common challenges we face together
5981376 consistently review our procedures to make sure that we are taking every reasonable step to ensure that the contributions we receive are appropriate and follow fec guidelines and we will do so again in light of this new information
5981377 were always looking for ways to best comply with all provisions of campaign finance regulations and obviously take swift action anytime flags are raised regarding potentially problematic campaign contributions
5981378 we didnt feel that it was appropriate for those individuals who want to lead our country to engage in divisive political activity on 9 11
5981379 i donated to the obama campaign because i was so excited and thrilled to hear him speak
5981380 i like what he says and i like what he represents and its a world stage today for any political leader
5981381 it was an error of me to give the donation and it was an error that it was accepted
5981382 consistently review our procedures to make sure that we are taking every reasonable step to ensure that the contributions we receive are appropriate and follow fec guidelines and we will do so again in light of this new information
5981383 were always looking for ways to best comply with all provisions of campaign finance regulations and obviously take swift action anytime flags are raised regarding potentially problematic campaign contributions
5981384 because i could see it wasnt going anywhere if i didnt do that
5981385 i wouldnt give up because i believe in the man i really do
5981386 maybe i just feel he can put a smile back on the face of the world
5981387 i t just takes some time little girl youre in the middle of the ride everything will be just fine everything will be alright
5981388 the man spasmed against the snow gods no no no sorcery hold him i said calmly as he tried to leap up and run
5981389 they blamed everything on the jewish conspiracy they hated western culture it was like living with jihad on a daily basis
5981390 we did make an award to leeds community school over nine years ago and any allegation that any funding weve given to any project has been misused and not used to change the lives of disadvantaged children and young people makes me concerned and very sad
5981391 no evidence has been produced that the money they received was used for terrorist activity clearly if there is an allegation of fraud then it is a matter for the police
5981392 bringen sie bitte ihre versichertenkarte 10 oder eine berweisung mit die praxis ist zwischen jungfernstieg und g nsemarkt
5981393 the eu committed to bind and eliminate duties on ita products in its wto tariff schedules
5981394 we believe that these duties are inconsistent with the eus commitments on these products and that they discourage technological innovation in the it sector
5981395 more categories are likely to follow as consumers feel more comfortable and retailers get their delivery models right making returns easier
5981396 for the past five years there has been a noticable trade imbalance between the usa and other nations working within the casino computer programmer volunteers market particularly in operations and human capital the recent advances however will help mend this rift and keep more dollars on shore i expect to see demand for labor increase in the long run with additional long run profits for strong casino computer programmer volunteers usa companies that move forward
5981397 to keep things fair for all parties were going to begin a general auction for our new products within 30 days anyone who wants in and we know that almost everyone does will have an opportunity to bid on the product first dibs go to the top 3 companies who will enjoy a 90 period free of competition from other casino computer programmer volunteers entities once this period expires other companies can access our new technology and use it as they see fit
5981398 im getting calls from casino computer programmer volunteers industry executives investors and general employees all asking about what is going on and if they can provide information for the news agency of course they want their names mentioned so that a little publicity is given to their particular casino computer programmer volunteers company but it does save me from hunting these people down and taking interviews
5981399 i predict stocks will rocket to 30 increases settle and finally creep their way up to 52 week highs
5981400 our fingers are crossed that corporate execs will honor all current contracts and not fire anyone
5981401 and if all contracts are solid were willing to negotiate with management at an appropriate time in the future to make sure our interests are being satisfied
5981402 the recent news in the casino computer programmer volunteers industry means big things for us including the need to expand our physical building and operations well be able to hire an additional and much needed 100 new employees who will help push our efforts forward this is going to be great
5981403 im pleased to report that technological advances by dreese bedient inc have created a much higher degree of efficieny in operations this means big profits for most casino computer programmer volunteers related companies and their subsidiaries
5981404 output of casino computer programmer volunteers related products will nearly double overhead will decrease by 1 3 and employee salaries will increase by 15
5981405 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
5981406 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
5981407 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
5981408 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
5981409 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5981410 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5981411 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5981412 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5981413 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5981414 sondereinsatztruppen der georgischen streitkr fte haben deutsche waffen die illegal nach georgien geliefert wurden
5981415 die meisten lehrlinge k nnen keine berufsschule am wohnort besuchen und m ssen daher im internat bernachten die internatskosten sind f r etliche lehrlinge so hoch dass sie um ihre lehrlingsentsch digung fallen
5981416 vor allem bei dienstleistungsberufen etwa bei friseuren oder zahntechnikern reicht die lehrlingsentsch digung im ersten lehrjahr nicht einmal f r die bezahlung der internatskosten aus eltern m ssen ihre kinder unterst tzen damit sie ber die 10 wochen in der berufsschule kommen
5981417 die volle bezahlung der internatskosten bernehmen nur jene betriebe die das in der betriebsvereinbarung so geregelt haben oder die industrie wo hundert prozent der internatskosten bezahlt werden
5981418 wir m ssen den stellenwert der lehre erh hen aber wenn die lehrlingsentsch digung schon f r den besuch der berufsschule aufgebraucht wird dann wird die lehre f r die jugendlichen immer unattraktiver
5981419 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5981420 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5981421 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5981422 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5981423 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5981424 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5981425 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5981426 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5981427 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5981428 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5981429 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5981430 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5981431 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5981432 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5981433 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
5981434 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
5981435 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
5981436 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
5981437 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
5981438 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
5981439 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
5981440 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
5981441 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
5981442 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
5981443 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
5981444 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
5981445 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
5981446 i started researching them and watching them and i just fell in love with iowa
5981447 coach ferentz told me it wasnt a guarantee which is a good thing to hear because you dont want to coast
5981448 him saying that made me want to do my best to make sure i could come back here
5981449 hes got a lot of work to do hes in the competition theres no question about that
5981450 now its in his hands to how quickly he can really get into great shape and how quickly he can show us that he really knows what he is doing and we can count on him and depend on him out there thats his task right now
5981451 when i left here and went to iowa central i realized the opportunity i had and i began to really appreciate it and i knew i was going to work hard there trying to get back here and be where i belong
5981452 i wouldnt have been able to come here in the first place i had never been this far away from home in my life all by myself
5981453 it was hard but it was part of growing up getting kicked out and having to do all this work to come back and not giving up made me a better person
5981454 i had staph infection so i couldnt go to class
5981455 i wasnt focused with being sick and being away from home for the first time on my own
5981456 i couldnt sleep at all it was hurting i couldnt sleep on my side
5981457 growing up my mom always told me not to give up and to finish what i started
5981458 and i started here they showed a loyalty to me to give me a scholarship so i needed to stay loyal to them and come back
5981459 its like i was still part of the family even though i was over there
5981460 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5981461 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5981462 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5981463 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5981464 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5981465 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5981466 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5981467 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5981468 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5981469 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5981470 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5981471 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
5981472 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
5981473 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
5981474 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
5981475 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
5981476 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
5981477 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5981478 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
5981479 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
5981480 i dont know if weve turned the corner yet our team said it best last year we were a building program and this year we are an emerging program
5981481 an emerging program hasnt turned the corner but were a lot farther ahead than we were a couple years ago
5981482 id never experienced anything like that there had been so much negative hype surrounding our program for so many years it was really refreshing it gave us a sense of pride that i dont think weve had for a long time
5981483 not good different or bad different we lost some good players but we have some good players we have great potential
5981484 i dont think well have a drop off but its something weve talked about a lot
5981485 the returners are giving the young players the confidence to do well and the freshman group is talented as we recruited them we talked to them a lot about this
5981486 its good to know that we can make it and this team can make it too
5981487 we dont really talk about not making it we know were going to make it so its just preparing for it
5981488 its the beginning of the season and we want them to be excited about it
5981489 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5981490 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5981491 die forschungsf rderung ist eines der wichtigsten wirtschaftspolitischen instrumente sterreich befindet sich immer noch in einem aufholprozess f r mich ist es wesentlich die richtigen strategischen weichenstellungen f r die n chsten jahre zu legen
5981492 grunds tzlich stellen wir fest dass wir die indirekte f rderung f r eine breitenwirkung und die direkte f rderung f r spitzenleistungen einsetzen werden
5981493 methodisch wurde ein mehrdimensionaler ansatz gew hlt 5000 unternehmen sowie 1400 forschungsinstitute wurden befragt literaturstudien programmanalysen und fachgespr che wurden durchgef hrt daten die bisher in kaum vergleichbarer form erhoben wurden werden vergleichbar gemacht und berpr ft
5981494 mir war es wichtig f r die alpbacher technologiegespr che 2008 einen zwischenbericht vorlegen zu k nnen um dieses gute umfeld f r eine strategische diskussion zu n tzen
5981495 rund 3000 darunter auch mittlere und kleine unternehmen nutzen die indirekte also steuerliche form der forschungsf rderung das ist ein wesentliches element f r die sicherung des standortes und damit der hier angesiedelten arbeitspl tze
5981496 es wurde vermutet dass sehr wenige unternehmen sehr hohe f rderungen bekommen in wirklichkeit profitieren viele unternehmen davon
5981497 das spricht klar f r die beibehaltung dieses instruments eine bergeb hrliche nutzung durch eine kleine anzahl gro er unternehmen ist nicht eingetreten die breite akzeptanz dieser f rderschiene beim mittelstand berzeugt mich
5981498 f r mich w re es optimal wenn es gelingt durch zielgenauere programme spitzenleistungen zu erm glichen die zus tzlich im rahmen unserer cluster und forschungszentren multiplikatoreffekte auf der mitarbeiter und ergebnisebene erreichen
5981499 auf grund der eigenkapitalsituation vor allem der kleinen und mittleren unternehmen in sterreich sowie der ausgelaufenen investitionsbeg nstigung
5981500 dieses anliegen muss aus sicht der wirtschaft unbedingt bestandteil einer kommenden steuerreform sein
5981501 die bisher letzte steuerreform im jahr 2005 brachte zwar eine wesentliche entlastung f r die k rperschaftsteuerpflichtigen unternehmen aber nicht f r einkommensteuerpflichtige unternehmen die die wesentliche s ule des mittelstandes bilden
5981502 die einf hrung einer k st option f r einzelunternehmen und personengesellschaften w re ein weiterer beitrag dazu
5981503 i just reviewed this dog of a manuscript for the journal of
5981504 wir begr en das wiener jugendpaket und freuen uns dass die stadt wien und der waff einen wichtigen beitrag zur sicherung und schaffung neuer lehrstellenpl tze leistet dar ber hinaus liegt es aber nun an den betrieben weitere lehrstellenpl tze zu schaffen jeder jugendliche ohne ausbildungsplatz ist ein lehrstellensuchender zuviel
5981505 es gibt immer mehr lehrstellenpl tze in wien und dies ist eine besonders positive entwicklung auch wenn wir von den historischen rund 31 000 lehrstellenpl tzen in wien aus dem jahre 1980 weit entfernt sind leider suchen in wien mit ende juli 2 666 jugendliche einen lehrstellenplatz und wir rufen daher die unternehmen auf ihre gesellschaftliche verantwortung wahrzunehmen und noch mehr ausbildungspl tze anzubieten rekordgewinne und rekordmanagergeh lter m ssen auch zu einem rekord bei lehrstellenpl tzen f hren nur ber den so genannten facharbeiterkr ftemangel zu jammern ist zu wenig
5981506 die stadt wien und der waff leisten hervorragende arbeit und wir w rden uns in allen bundesl ndern derartige initiativen w nschen so ist der weiterbildungsbonus oder auch die f rderung von weiterbildungsma nahmen der ausbildnerinnen in den betrieben besonders wichtig von bedeutung ist allerdings dass neben der quantit t auch die qualit t der ausbildungspl tze eine entsprechende hohe ist daher schlagen wir vor dass nach einem halben jahr eine evaluierungskommission der sozialpartner betriebe beim erstmaligen ausbilden mit rat und tat durch ein gespr ch vor ort unterst tzt damit k nnen allf llige missverst ndnisse bei der erstmaligen lehrausbildung gleich abgefangen werden
5981507 als n chste schritte fordern wir die senkung der klassensch lerinnenh chstzahl auf 25 in den berufsschulen sowie eine mindestlehrlingsentsch digung geregelt durch einen generalkollektivvertrag dieser soll auch die f r jugendliche in arbeitsmarktpolitischen ma nahmen den so genannten jasg kursen als mindest entsch digung fungieren leider brauchen derzeit bereits rund 54 der lehrlinge finanzielle unterst tzung der eltern um ber die runden zu kommen
5981508 die nachfrage nach professioneller rascher und unb rokratischer beratung in sachen pflege steigt immer weiter deshalb wurde vor einigen wochen das n pflege servicezentrum am n landhausboulevard er ffnet
5981509 erfreulich in diesem zusammenhang ist dass das nieder sterreichische pflege modell vorbild war f r die verhandlungen auf bundesebene und f r das bundesweite pflegemodell
5981510 um den einstieg in die welt der wissenschaft und forschung auch f r klein und mittelbetriebe sicherzustellen startet das land nieder sterreich mit dieser internet plattform nun eine neue informationsoffensive
5981511 ziel ist es das kreative und wissenschaftliche potenzial nieder sterreichs f r alle innovativen unternehmen transparent und nutzbar zu machen
5981512 verbleib f r besonders gut integrierte und von abschiebung bedrohte personen und familien
5981513 am 28 juli 2008 haben wir in der o landesregierung die forderung nach einem abschiebestopp f r besonders gut integrierte familien beschlossen und einen eigenen entsprechenden beschluss aufgrund der dringlichkeit und schwierigkeit ihrer lage f r die familien pacolli shala und hayta gefasst da die zeit dr ngt w hrend f r die familie shala die ausreisefrist bereits abgelaufen ist l uft diese f r die familie pacolli am 24 8 2008 aus die betroffenen und ihre freunde bef rchten die abschiebung das kann und darf nicht sein diese familien sind die besten beispiele f r hervorragend integrierte lange bei uns befindliche menschen denen endlich die t gliche angst vor der abschiebung genommen werden muss und f r die sicherheit geschaffen werden muss wir appellieren an innenministerin fekter sich rasch klar f r eine menschliche l sung zu positionieren
5981514 welche kriterien m ssen menschen erf llen um in sterreich ohne angst leben zu d rfen
5981515 welche kriterien noch frau innenministerin fekter m ssen menschen die seit vielen jahren hier leben arbeiten zur schule gehen freundinnen und freunde haben deutsch besser sprechen als ihre muttersprache und von allen geachtet werden noch erf llen
5981516 oder gilt der kriterienkatalog des ehemaligen innenministers platter der vor fast einem jahr gro als faire l sung f r ein bleiberecht vorgestellt wurde nicht und war nur eine zeitungsente
5981517 und dieses zeichen gilt nicht nur f r die beiden familien sondern f r ganz sterreich das sich in den jahren nach dem zweiten weltkrieg einen namen als hort der fl chtlinge und der menschenrechte gemacht hat der jetzt durch die sture politik perspektivloser innenminister gef hrdet ist
5981518 insbesonders ober sterreich das das dichteste netzwerk von b rgerinnen und b rgern aufweist die sich f r die rechte von migrantinnen und ihren familien einsetzen und vorzeigen wie gelebte integration funktioniert hat sich so eine blamable fl chtlingspolitik nicht verdient
5981519 es geht um die menschenrechte aber diesmal nicht irgendwo in einem fernen land sondern hier bei uns in sterreich
5981520 die fp bekennt sich grunds tzlich zum drei s ulen modell zum umlageverfahren und zu einer harmonisierung der pensionssysteme
5981521 fazit der bisherigen erfahrungen aber ist dass bei den pensionskassen die renditen der eigent mer im vordergrund stehen das system ist so konstruiert dass die versicherungen verdienen und die versicherten das risiko tragen und draufzahlen
5981522 eine novellierung des pensionskassengesetzes durch eine risikoaufteilung auf versicherte pensionskassen arbeitgeber und staat sowie mehr transparenz verst rkte mitbestimmung der versicherten und mehr kontrollen durch diese sowie die fma sind notwendig die fp tritt grunds tzlich gegen spekulationen mit pensionsgeld auf
5981523 nachdem die vp ihren jahrelangen widerstand gegen eine erh hung der familienbeihilfe aufgegeben hat ist der nun erzielte konsens einer anhebung im zuge einer 13 auszahlung der familienbeihilfe ein erster wichtiger schritt f r mehr einkommensgerechtigkeit f r die familien eine weitere entlastung muss im zuge einer steuerreform welche bereits am 1 1 2009 wirksam wird kommen
5981524 der mut zum kind scheitert vielfach auch an der angst vor den zus tzlichen kosten oder dem sehr lange andauernden entfall eines familieneinkommens was angesichts der ohnehin massiv gestiegenen lebenshaltungskosten f r viele familien sehr belastend ist ein kind darf nicht zur kostenfrage werden hier m ssen weitere unterst tzungen geschaffen werden
5981525 auch die nebenkosten selbstbehalte und schulbeitr ge welche die eltern jedes schuljahr f r ihre spr sslinge bezahlen m ssen sind gestiegen wird nachhilfe ben tig so kann das schon pro jahr einige hundert euro ausmachen ein neue ausstattung zum schulanfang ein computer weil er einfach von der ausbildung her gefordert ist oder auch nur die teilnahme am schikurs oder der landschulwoche k nnen ein tiefes loch in das haushaltsbudget rei en im zuge der kommenden steuerreform sollte auch die m glichkeit geschaffen werden derartige ausgaben im rahmen des steuerausgleichs steuerlich absetzen zu k nnen bei all diesen aufwendungen geht es schlie lich nicht um luxus sondern ganz einfach notwendigkeiten im zuge der ausbildung der kinder dies muss auch seitens des staates unterst tzt werden
5981526 durch die von anfang an verfolgte designstrategie hat das museumsquartier trotz seiner vielf ltigkeit ein einheitliches erscheinungsbild was bei einem kulturareal von dieser gr e von gro er wichtigkeit ist die nominierung beim dme award 2008 best tigt den erfolg unseres konzepts
5981527 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5981528 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
5981529 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
5981530 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
5981531 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
5981532 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5981533 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5981534 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5981535 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5981536 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5981537 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5981538 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5981539 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5981540 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5981541 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5981542 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5981543 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5981544 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5981545 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5981546 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
5981547 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
5981548 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
5981549 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
5981550 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
5981551 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
5981552 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
5981553 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
5981554 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
5981555 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
5981556 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
5981557 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
5981558 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
5981559 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
5981560 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
5981561 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
5981562 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
5981563 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
5981564 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
5981565 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
5981566 preacher ill tell you that was a damned fine sermon damned good
5981567 thank you sir but id rather you didnt use profanity
5981568 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5981569 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5981570 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5981571 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5981572 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5981573 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5981574 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5981575 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5981576 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5981577 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5981578 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5981579 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5981580 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5981581 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5981582 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5981583 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5981584 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5981585 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5981586 i would answer back hard what do you mean hes not one of us its john mccain who wears 500 shoes has six houses and comes from one of the richest families in his state
5981587 its barack obama who climbed up the hard way and thats why he wants middle class tax cuts and better schools for our kids
5981588 we are reluctant to raise prices in japan because the market is so sluggish
5981589 is to help them return to full productive lives through work
5981590 jugendkriminalit t steigt 10 000 lehrstellen fehlen und regierung sieht tatenlos zu
5981591 die jugendkriminalit t steigt weiter und erreicht bedenkliche ausma e obwohl den vp innenministern diese tatsache seit jahren bekannt ist bleiben sie unt tig und bedienen sich lediglich rechter rhetorik besonders besorgniserregend ist der anstieg der kriminalit t bei strafunm ndigen mit einem plus von 30 prozent die schon vor ihrem 14 geburtstag auf die schiefe bahn geraten w hrend vp und sp von mehr chancen f r jugendliche sprechen und nichts von h rteren strafen wissen wollen werden nun zahlen ver ffentlicht wonach sterreichweit 10 000 lehrstellen fehlen beide statistiken belegen das versagen von rot und schwarz auf ganzer linie
5981592 die fp erkennt sehr wohl den zusammenhang zwischen einem schwierigen sozialen umfeld und der bereitschaft zu verbrechen dennoch m ssen neben ma nahmen zur verbesserung der ausbildung auch h rtere strafen als mittel der abschreckung angewandt werden der forderungskatalog der fp umfasst die schnupperhaft anhebung der mindeststrafrahmen erwachsenenstrafrecht ab dem dritten schweren delikt video berwachung an problemschulen und an schulen wo es die schulleitung f r sinnvoll erachtet sowie gesicherte internate f r strafunm ndige t ter nach dem vorbild der schweiz wir k nnen es uns nicht leisten dieser entwicklung weiterhin tatenlos zuzusehen w hrend die kriminalit t und die gewaltbereitschaft steigen beschwichtigen die sozialhelfer und die 68er p dagogen damit sie ihr scheitern nicht eingestehen m ssen
5981593 anstatt immer nur von chancen zu reden und sinnleere jugendkampagnen von stapel zu lassen sollen rot und schwarz endlich den zusammenhang zwischen der notwendigkeit einer besseren ausbildung und der sicherung heimischer facharbeitskr fte erkennen hierzu m sste erstens die lehrerausbildung auf ein h heres niveau gehoben werden um die ausbildung der sch ler wieder zu verbessern und die bereitschaft zur leistung wieder herzustellen zweitens muss die lehre wieder attraktiver werden indem ein modell von modulen an die stelle der bisherigen lehrlingsausbildung tritt statt eines starren lehrvertrages wird ein flexibler praktikumsvertrag abgeschlossen parallel zu diesem k nnen drei module in sechs semestern absolviert werden dem unternehmen entfallen die kosten f r die ausbildung anschlie end kann man in weiteren modulen eine meisterpr fung eine unternehmerpr fung oder die berufsmatura abschlie en dadurch wird die n tige flexibilit t f r die unternehmen geschafft und die jungen werden zur leistung erzogen

5981600 as long as russian forces are occupying a part of georgia i cannot see a russia nato council convening
5981601 russia has made it pretty clear its not that anxious to improve co operation with nato so if nato suspends talks thats unlikely to have much leverage
5981602 france is resolved to pursue the battle against terrorism for democracy and freedom the cause is just and it is to the credit of france and its armed forces to defend it
5981603 the problem is not the number of soldiers but the mission they are sent on
5981604 this loss of life is absolutely deplorable but also could be anticipated when you have forces that enter an environment where their role is counter insurgency not peacekeeping or reconstruction
5981605 this is the first time a large number of foreign soldiers have been killed in the vicinity of the capital of afghanistan
5981606 last year all the big cities like kabul and kandahar were not under threat
5981607 but this year in kandahar many big attacks have happened
5981608 the taliban announced their intentions at the end of last year to aim to make access to the capital more difficult
5981609 and its strategic purpose is that it grabs a lot more international attention than just some far flung district and it makes life more difficult for ordinary citizens as well as the logistics of the military
5981610 we in canada have understood over the past several years how difficult this mission is
5981611 toto i have a feeling were not in kansas anymore

5981621 what i remembered about temple sinai when i was here last is that the congregation is very participatory its a nice group of people and some of my old friends from the area are members
5981622 my motivation for pursuing my career path was colored by adolescent zeal
5981623 in those years i began to understand the limitations as well as the great potentialities of synagogue life
5981624 when people come into a synagogue whether for services a class or even a meeting they should have the opportunity to learn something about judaism whether its a better understanding of judaism or a bit of relevance or tradition its important to help people feel more connected to jewish tradition
5981625 shabbat is the perfect opportunity for this type of get together on shabbat we find time for people we dont have time for during the week
5981626 temple sinai selected rabbi abramson as our next rabbi because we felt that he had exceptional experience with very strong leadership skills
5981627 during the interview process he displayed an enthusiastic approach to judaism and scholarship and congregants found him both personable and engaging rabbi abramson provides a strong background in traditional conservative judaism along with a modern sophistication that we believe will relate well to the younger generation in the community
5981628 continuity and tradition are needed in any synagogue but also change im eager to help breathe new life into old traditions
5981629 any allegation of wrongdoing is nothing more than garbage being shoveled by the city attorneys political opponents hiding behind the cloak of anonymity
5981630 when i came to temple sinai i was most impressed by the wonderful spirit that is alive in all that we do it is both a pleasure and a personal joy to serve a community of caring people our congregation is a place of warmth joy and community temple sinai is a place of openness to all where each person can connect where comfort and caring matter it is a place of strength and beauty of spirituality and learning of creative possibility a place filled with gods spirit and human kindness
5981631 temple sinai began as a religious school thus it is a place with torah at its center where serious learning is for everyone where prayer is meaningful participatory powerful and innovative where people reach out to one another during times of celebration and sadness and where we experience the fullness of jewish life

5981708 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5981709 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5981710 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5981711 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5981712 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5981713 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5981714 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5981715 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5981716 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5981717 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5981718 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5981719 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5981720 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5981721 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5981722 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5981723 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5981724 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5981725 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5981726 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5981727 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5981728 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5981729 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5981730 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5981731 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5981732 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5981733 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5981734 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5981735 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5981736 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5981737 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5981738 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5981739 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5981740 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5981741 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5981742 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5981743 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5981744 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5981745 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5981746 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5981747 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5981748 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5981749 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5981750 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5981751 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5981752 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5981753 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5981754 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5981755 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5981756 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5981757 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5981758 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5981759 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5981760 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5981761 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5981762 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5981763 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5981764 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5981765 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5981766 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5981767 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5981768 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5981769 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5981770 this is a planning took where all things are going
5981771 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5981772 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5981773 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5981774 it was a very fast race and the coach and the athlete decided that it would be better if he did not compete
5981775 he will be rewarded for his efforts and the king will receive him and the other members of the team personally when he returns
5981776 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5981777 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5981778 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5981779 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5981780 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5981781 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5981782 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5981783 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5981784 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5981785 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5981786 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5981787 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5981788 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5981789 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5981790 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5981791 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5981792 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5981793 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5981794 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5981795 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5981796 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5981797 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5981798 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5981799 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5981800 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5981801 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5981802 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5981803 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5981804 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5981805 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that

5981824 while house prices are falling access to the property market is being increasingly limited by the costs and more restrictive terms of a substantially reduced supply of mortgage finance
5981825 we are seeing corrections in individual locations throughout the country the main cause of these is the developments of new blocks of two bedroom flats coming on stream
5981826 in many places this has had a positive effect as it has allowed the rental market to provide stability in housing at a time of volatility in the sales market it also demolishes the myth of soaring rent levels
5981827 house prices are down 6 in just the last five months and the worst of the credit crisis all that still lies ahead
5981828 the current issue affecting the market is fundamentally about the supply of credit a very different situation to the early 90s which was about high interest rates and unemployment

5981838 i went out on june 2 to stay with a friend and when i got back last monday i found my door had been smashed in
5981839 my neighbours thought i had died so they got in touch with police who came and broke the door down
5981840 the police were watching the flat but then one of the neighbours received a postcard from me and said so thats where he is
5981841 the decline in prices is caused by the difficulties created for potential house purchasers by the rapid rise in house prices in the last few years a squeeze on spending power and the reduction in credit availability

5981877 im one for a nice clean salon so im definitely on a mission to see if they clean up properly
5981878 were promoting an idea with an unfalsifiable and therefore unscientific premise
5981879 weve never given any examples of how creationism constitutes a theory with predictive power
5981880 were growing every practice and weve got a lot of potential if the underclassmen can really come through and play with great intensity were going to surprise a lot of people
5981881 i feel like me and christina and lindsey just have to go out there and show that we can be leaders
5981882 we have the opportunity to be a great team like weve had the last three years
5981883 some people might think this would be a rebuilding year but we had a good summer and learned a lot
5981884 weve got quite a bit of speed were more of a finesse team
5981885 i dont know if we have that mean streak yet
5981886 theyve got to have that badin pride and drive the kids we had in the past were going to represent their school to the utmost thats what were talking to these kids about
5981887 christina its her defense to build shes the captain back there
5981888 megan had a great year last year and were going to need her even more this year because were so young
5981889 as a team it would be fabulous if we could make a new trend and become the first badin team to make it to the state finals four straight times if we can attack the game and play as a team i think we have a good chance

5981903 we do not own the earth we are part of it

5981905 typhoon nuri is on course to hit the south china coast and cause a deterioration in the weather later tomorrow and friday
5981906 the sad fact is that come christmas time we estimate that one million australians will suffer mortgage stress thats a huge number of people that are potentially going to face losing their property unless drastic action is taken
5981907 sydney got richer in the first five years of the new century but that new wealth was very unevenly spread about
5981908 this is consistent with an analysis of the changing income growth across the city with stagnant household incomes in many middle and outer west suburbs contrasting to strong income growth in the inner eastern and northern suburbs
5981909 its not unusual to see a person come with a large mortgage debt but also a string of credit cards as well which they have often maxed out to maintain the mortgage for as long as they can they use credit cards to buy food pay utilities
5981910 theres definitely an economic divide in sydney theres two economies operating the one our clients operate in and the other that you see on the front page of the australian financial review
5981911 it is obvious rising rents are being driven by high mortgage rates
5981912 on one hand landlords are trying to offset increased costs and on the other hand high interest rates deter renters from making the shift into home ownership
5981913 this is like the ultimate youve got striking youve got grappling youve got weapons anything goes
5981914 it gives you the idea of really finding out what martial arts are like not just doing pretty forms
5981915 when i face someone with a stick i get hit and i hit him everything else all the little things the bills the reports are gone
5981916 it makes me feel alive i have never felt better than when i am doing this
5981917 its about developing it in a healthy way before it discharges inappropriately
5981918 its like these extreme experiences where they drop a group of three or four guys without food and water into the middle of the wilderness and they have to survive for four or five days and they come out feeling like they are brothers
5981919 we are here to test ourselves and test each other but the default assumption is that we are going to care for each other
5981920 oddly enough what i feel is love honestly i wish i could find a church with the same spirit of support and love
5981921 la voz de aztlan has learned that the israeli embassy used heavy handed measures to have the two israelis released
5981922 palestinian security forces have arrested a group of palestinians for collaborating with israel and posing as operatives of osama bin ladens al qaeda terrorist network a senior official said yesterday the arrests come two days after israeli prime minister ariel sharon charged al qaeda militants were operating in gaza and in lebanon it was considered a surprise because the gaza strip is virtually sealed off by israeli troops the hardline israeli leader also charged other members of the terror group were cooperating with lebanons shiite militia hizbollah
5981923 evidence linking these israelis to 9 11 is classified i cannot tell you about the evidence that has been gathered it is classified information
5981924 could federal buildings in houston and other cities be under surveillance by foreign groups
5981925 hatchett says they could be doing what he would be doing if he were a terrorist sizing up the situation
5981926 a former defense department analyst hatchett believes groups may be gathering intelligence for possible future attacks
5981927 some organization thinking in terms of a potential retaliation against the u s government could be scouting out potential targets and looking for targets that would be vulnerable
5981928 well that was just a serendipitous thirty six thats a pattern
5981929 investigators within the dea ins and fbi have all told fox news that to pursue or even suggest israeli spying is considered career suicide
5981930 are you suggesting that you are convinced that there was a state sponsor behind 9 11
5981931 i think there is very compelling evidence that at least some of the terrorists were assisted not just in financing although that was part of it by a sovereign foreign government and that we have been derelict in our duty to track that down make the further case or find the evidence that would indicate that that is not true and we can look for other reasons why the terrorists were able to function so effectively in the united states
5981932 do you think that will ever become public which countries youre talking about
5981933 it will become public at some point when its turned over to the archives but thats 20 or 30 years from now and we need to have this information now because its relevant to the threat that the people of the united states are facing today
5981934 evidence linking these israelis to 9 11 is classified i cannot tell you about the evidence that has been gathered it is classified information

5981939 these differentials between direct to lender and broker products have persisted for the last couple of months and they are now an established market condition that shows no sign of disappearing
5981940 just having access to product sourcing data that includes direct to lender products is not the whole story as brokers will need to produce a kfi generate documentation for the fee payment and have an effective way of collecting that payment

5981949 i told her she was in charge of her own decisions now
5981950 the results are a direct reflection of the need for more beds and community services
5981951 its got to be evident to everybody that we need more addiction and other services and smaller caseloads for mental health workers so they can provide more intensive treatment in and out of hospitals
5981952 hospitals are doing what they can but beds are at a premium and there is so much pressure to move people out
5981953 is to help them return to full productive lives through work
5981954 i like being honest i think the fans merit that and i would tell them we are in for a hard season
5981955 this season is going to be a very difficult one because we are trying to gel our whole squad to get a settled 11 players and to get wins and we are doing it on the run
5981956 the whole personnel that has been in and around the place for the last five or six years have gone
5981957 so we are now trying to build for another five or six years and thats the difficult part sometimes it takes that wee bit more time
5981958 i very much hope the fans are realistic enough to understand whats happening and what we are trying to achieve
5981959 in the end they will dictate whether this team has confidence or no confidence if they dont get behind this novicey side then it will be a hard hard season
5981960 but if they get behind them like they did against wolves and reading hopefully the players will respond properly and get better and better
5981961 i ask the fans to be patient and respectful of the players
5981962 they can shout as much as they want at me im too old in the tooth now to have a problem with that
5981963 its how well we can gel together as a club the fans and the players because if the fans turn on the players and they dont want the ball it gets very very hard
5981964 but i know these fans and they have realistic goals and aims
5981965 there are a minority who have got probably unrealistic thoughts of this football club
5981966 but the majority are realists and you just have to look at the history of this football club to know we always do it the hard way
5981967 the important thing for us now is to rally around the flag lets all be in the same boat going in the same direction
5981968 i can tell the fans we are going to lose a lot more games this season but hopefully we will win more than we lose
5981969 had i got this squad together midway through the close season and 22 of them had turned up for the first day of pre season we would have been further along the road
5981970 the problem is that we have brought in a body here a body there a body here and a body there
5981971 that has been a difficult scenario and i have still not finished on that side of it i have got until september 1 to try to find one or two more players
5981972 i would love to have a face or two in for saturday the sky televised home game against swansea city
5981973 thor is demanding the company recognise the union and accord them organisational rights
5981974 the company has advised that it was prepared to recognise thor on condition that they accept the applicability of the south african road passenger bargaining councils sarpbac main agreement thor has failed to agree to this
5981975 it takes a long time get everything rolling to get plans approved and decide on design
5981976 this is a really hard job a lot of times that scares people off
5981977 but i think for the most part the district is in a really good place i think everybody is really happy with the job were doing
5981978 whats funny is that people have a different image of me than what is really here
5981979 i was willing to take chances but i didnt have a clear vision about anything i am just a very simple human being probably everyone else is too we need to share that and do the best we can with what we have
5981980 we figured we couldnt change it by referendum the powers that be werent going to give up power so we opted for a suit
5981981 people get better representation when they have someone to talk to in their district but i really feel when you have a mayor at large everybody in the city gets to vote for the mayor
5981982 everythings political the air you breathe the gasoline you buy the food you buy
5981983 im addressing political issues every day but at the individual or family level

5981985 the unions have been very responsive and have listened to us
5981986 the measure will help to ensure that live oak schools continue to provide the quality of education that our students deserve despite shrinking state and federal funding

5981991 i dont care where you put it its too big for scotts valley i dont want scotts valley to become stevens creek boulevard
5981992 this should have sent a clear message to the city that they should be having these meetings this was the very first meeting ever where the city answered questions
5981993 it was literally nonsensical from a productive standpoint the meeting doesnt make sense because theres nothing to talk about yet
5981994 it really boils down to some people dont want it no matter what
5981995 i have a family in scotts valley i have a business in scotts valley
5981996 i have the same concerns everyone else does but i want to see the outcome

5982007 so i decided to try to record an album of his songs
5982008 twenty seven out of 30 people in the room were convinced it was george michael singing
5982009 but i did not expect to get this far and perhaps release a george michael covers album

5982022 with more than half of all soils on earth now being cultivated for food crops grazed or periodically logged for wood how to sustain earths soils is becoming a major scientific and policy issue
5982023 sufficient evidence has emerged of stratigraphically significant change both elapsed and imminent for recognition of the anthropocene currently a vivid yet informal metaphor of global environmental change as a new geological epoch to be considered for formalization by international discussion
5982024 societys most important scientific questions include the future of earths soil
5982025 can soils double food production in the next few decades is soil exacerbating the global carbon cycle and climatic warming how can land management improve soils processing of carbon nutrients wastes toxics and water all to minimize adverse effects on the environment
5982026 this is an old story writ large of widespread cropping without nutrient recycling with the result being soil infertility
5982027 and agriculture is only part of the reason why soils are so rapidly changing expanding cities industries mining and transportation systems all impact soil in ways that are far more permanent than cultivation
5982028 if humanity is to succeed in the coming decades we must interact much more positively with the great diversity of earths soils
5982029 even though the toll is so high you should be proud of what you are doing the work that youre doing here is indispensable

5982045 the reject shop is well positioned for future growth underpinned by continued improvement in existing stores as well as a robust store rollout program
5982046 sales for the first few weeks of this year have been very pleasing and the new store openings have been to plan
5982047 this is a very pleasing result for the company in the face of general market uncertainty and the impact on consumer confidence caused by high interest rates and petrol prices particularly in the second half
5982048 this result reflects our continuing focus on retail fundamentals in offering our customers great value in the products we sell
5982049 with the potential to open 400 stores nationally we are now focused on the steps we need to take to ensure we have the capacity to continue to grow while maintaining a focus on the day to day needs of the business

5982051 i invest heavily in areas that look promising but also proportionately balance my risk by putting some money in standard investments such as stocks bonds and money market funds
5982052 my top tip is making baby steps before giant leaps
5982053 by starting slowly your risk factor is greatly diminished and financial commitment is much lower you can get out at any time with minimal losses or move forward into more risky online gaming for the greater society areas with good fundamental knowledge
5982054 were looking at the long term here quick wins are for lotteries and penny poker games not the online gaming for the greater society investment market i think given enough time those who invest in this area will see good returns for their online gaming for the greater society money
5982055 the motivation to have money from a online gaming for the greater society portfolio in the future is great
5982056 but dont forget that you cant live in the future forever many people fall into the trap of not meeting basic needs in the present which logically means that their future will become progressively more difficult
5982057 make online gaming for the greater society investments work for you and retire wealthy
5982058 give yourself a nice cussion of cash and retirement income
5982059 personally i save about 10 each month for retirement 20 as liquid cash for everyday needs and another 40 for investing this may sound very demanding especially with regard to online gaming for the greater society investments but in actuality it is really a reflection of what you want for your future not necessarily what you want now
5982060 we want all of this to be simple and risk to be nominal the main area in which people have difficutly is assessing their wealth and risk factors far too often we see online gaming for the greater society investors jumping into a portfolio that is far too aggressive the end result can be disasterous invoking many to file bankruptcy

5982064 due to the huge increase in multi family fires this past year the local red cross has already depleted its emergency relief budget
5982065 with the addition of this large scale disaster we need financial help
5982066 the calhoun branch red cross chapter is not a government agency and we must rely on the generosity of the american public
5982067 with your ongoing support we will continue to be there providing relief for today and hope for tomorrow for people in crisis
5982068 unfortunately as ive told seniors who ive talked to is we dont have as many answers as they would like because were still working through many of the issues
5982069 whether hud and mshda state housing development authority can help us speed that up im not sure at this point
5982070 the next time i see albion college president donna randall im going to give her my personal thanks
5982071 none of these wins and losses will count in two weeks and they dont matter now
5982072 these are preseason games and all were doing is trying to get ourselves ready for the regular season
5982073 it was a lot funner when it was my whole season but now i know that ive got 16 more games to play
5982074 you just kind of want to get through it improve each week and get to the regular season
5982075 what is more meaningful to me is that the pad level is down the hustle and the effort are there and were getting good run fits on defense
5982076 one thing that we stress every week is fundamentals and i thought that was good this week it isnt what i want but it is better

5982086 up to 10 weeks of on set mentorship working alongside department heads and crew members on a feature film or episodic television project
5982087 it will take several years to get everyone unless we are deluged with production companies
5982088 all we can do is give them a leg up at the end of the day it will be their responsibility to see who is coming and find work many of the students in training will become production assistants
5982089 the goal was to present an opportunity to get into the unions and the only way to do that is to get the unions involved
5982090 connecticut really wants to create a pool of people who are eligible to work on big films when they come here if the state can present a pool of qualified people who are eventually in the union that would make the state much more attractive

5982094 with the exception of peak periods i think normally we would be looking at a 299 dollar fare from kuala lumpur to london so all in a return flight of within 1000 dollars the herald sun quoted osman rani as saying

5982203 we only lost 11 times last season but on the days you lose you get stick for not having a centre half who heads the ball out of your box
5982204 on days like that you get stick for not having a midfield player who tackles everything that moves

5982216 first off please explain what net reflector is and what it does
5982217 reflector is a browser and analysis tool for net it allows developers to navigate search disassemble and analyze net components
5982218 like thousands of other developers i find reflector to be an indispensable tool reflector allows you to peer beyond the public api and gives the developer a chance to really understand how the underlying classes work or dont work in many cases it can save you hours when looking for a workaround to some quirk
5982219 lutz reflector is recognized by scott hanselman as one of
5982220 one of the 10 must have tools every developer should download now
5982221 i wanted to write a tool that made it easier to browse and navigate components when net was announced i started to work on reflector and kept improving it users provided lots of feedback and other developers started creating add ins to make it even more useful
5982222 ive used net reflector for years and its at the top of my list of great net tools its also one of the few tools every developer here uses so i knew i was not alone a few months ago i dropped lutz an email introducing myself and it just kind of went from there
5982223 when james emailed me and we spoke about the future of reflector and the resources red gate could make available to the project it made the decision easy for me
5982224 how can it be good news that a commercial software company is taking ownership of a free community tool
5982225 i think we can provide a level of resources that will move the tool forward in a big way the first thing we are doing is continuing to offer the software to the community for free downloading the second thing is giving our product management and usability teams the task of going out into the community to get suggestions on how we can make this amazing tool even better we accept the fact that there will be scepticism but we can point to a good track record of support for the community people were wary a couple of years ago when we purchased the sql server central community site but over time we have won over many of our critics by investing heavily in the site and boosting its readership while allowing it to maintain editorial independence im hoping i will be able to sit here in a few years time and claim the same level of success with reflector
5982226 youve already said james that net reflector is easy to use and works exactly as it should how can you improve on that
5982227 i dont know yet this is what well glean from the community we know we have a responsibility to the development community not to ruin a tool that is so widely used and so valuable to developers in their day to day jobs but we also know that red gate has the in house expertise to translate user desires into simple elegant products
5982228 will you continue to be involved with net reflector lutz
5982229 i will be using reflector and im sure i will be emailing james every so often asking for new features
5982230 over the past eight years lutz has built up a unique understanding of the net developer community i hope he will continue to provide us with valuable input into the future of net reflector
5982231 will red gate still encourage the community to write and use add ins
5982232 yes that wont change and we encourage and value all the net reflector add in writers
5982233 uh oh the pressure is on already enough talk i need to get to work

5982270 i think no matter what you do youre always going to have wembley in the back of your mind but weve got the trip to huddersfield which is going to be a hard game
5982271 we have to prepare as you would for any other game because if you do go in soft thats when you get an injury or get hurt so weve just got to get through this game

5982276 i told them to forgive each other help each other and strive to get home what else could i say
5982277 i trusted and believed him because i thought usaa would look at my credit report and understand
5982278 lets take a look at what the rates are today
5982279 why is the interest rate you are telling me different from the interest rate on the usaa website
5982280 does usaa add 1 8 to the interest rate because my credit score is less than 720
5982281 you will need to add 1 8 to the published interest rate because your credit score is less than 720
5982282 given all these matters i am satisfied that there are special circumstances
5982283 they also support a conclusion that there is no risk of flight
5982284 this is an application in which bail should be issued
5982285 the approach is blunt and focused only on economic measures

5982288 anything that makes an australian vacation disproportionately expensive is an incentive for tourists domestic or international to go elsewhere
5982289 in 2002 oil was us25 per barrel and the industry fuel bill was us40 billion nobody can predict where the price will go but even a us1 increase adds us1 6 billion to industry costs
5982290 airlines could lose as much as us6 1 billion a7 0 billion this year
5982291 already some 25 airlines in our financial systems have gone bust greater than immediately following september 11 and we are bracing for more
5982292 the programme was not something i was trying to set out to do from the very beginning
5982293 i just thought while i had the opportunity i would give it a go if im going to get involved in something like this then im going to give it everything
5982294 i had done coaching with newcastle in schools before especially kicking skills
5982295 some of them had previously found certain skills difficult to then suddenly see them actually do these skills saying how much it had helped was just fantastic
5982296 the kids i had were so good they would give everything they were an absolute pleasure to work with
5982297 its a great feeling to give them the chance to really push their ambitions to help them play better
5982298 the hotshots experience has definitely made me consider going into coaching working with kids i think steve black newcastle falcons fitness coach and dave aldred kicking coach who were also helping out would also say the same
5982299 to be honest i never thought it would change my life as much as it has and for the better
5982300 three years ago i didnt even know how to hold the damn thing im self taught so ive been taking my time learning all the basics
5982301 there are some days when i pick the guitar up and im so bad i think have i actually learned anything
5982302 and then there are other days when im playing better than i ever have done
5982303 even if ive played 100 games in a row there will still be things i will be disappointed with even if weve won every game
5982304 se non ci diamo una mano a vicenda ci fan fuori tutti e due
5982305 when you think of a heroin addict you dont think of me
5982306 its an economics thing if someone is hooked on oxy and cant afford to pay 80 per pill then they turn to heroin
5982307 people say that heroin went away its never gone anywhere
5982308 but the user group has changed the old time heroin user was the guy on the street corner now we have kids from the suburbs
5982309 the price of oxycontin has doubled in the last year and a half in the milwaukee area people are moving to heroin
5982310 heroin used to be thought of as a drug of the poor in depressed areas
5982311 here its across all lines we have everything from well to do affluent areas to depressed housing
5982312 when you can snort it and youre already snorting other drugs it becomes no big deal
5982313 why am i taking 10 pills when i can do a bag of heroin and get 7 or 10 times as high
5982314 there was no end to what she could have become
5982315 now shes locked up in a womens prison she hasnt seen her kids in over a year it crushed my family and its ruined her family
5982316 i just had to call up one of my friends i just had to go around the corner
5982317 you would see jewelry and you would just have to take it
5982318 no matter where you were you just see it as drugs any rational thought process is out the window
5982319 she was my daughter and i loved her but at the same time i hated her at that moment so much for what she had done to her family
5982320 i come from a good family you never imagine yourself stealing from your own family you never imagine yourself as a heroin addict but it grabs onto you and it doesnt let go
5982321 the maltese government has submitted to us all its plans and we have already had a very fruitful series of discussions however we need more clarifications and that is why commissioner kroes will be coming over she wants to clear the air and try to reach some kind of agreement on the way forward of this privatisation process
5982322 strictly speaking the striking off of the companys losses constitutes direct state aid and we are still not sure whether this is legal and according to eu competition rules
5982323 this will mean that the eventual new owners managers of the shipyards would need to register a new company to manage the facility and still start afresh this will also mean that the government would not need to fork out any money and give out more subsidies however the government is still resisting this idea
5982324 at this stage i prefer not to comment further as these are very sensitive discussions
5982325 although it is true that the government has the option of liquidating the company we are choosing to go along a different path particularly in the interest of the shipyards current workforce i hope that the eu also understands our position
5982326 mckesson makes its own decisions about numbers of counsellors available at any point in time
5982327 meanwhile we have not received any complaints regarding counsellors not being available to take calls
5982328 and if its truncated and women dont get to say and hear everything they should that may not be helpful
5982329 the best way of remaining faithful to your comrades is to continue the work to lift your heads to be professional
5982330 i dont have any doubt about that we have to be here
5982331 i tell you in all conscience if it had to be done again i would do it

5982338 t j really came on for us at the end
5982339 morgan keeps getting stronger and is another weapon for us
5982340 now weve got to figure out how to use it

5982368 after a lot of testing weve reproduced a number of different cases where applying the xp sp3 upgrade adds additional registry keys within already existing symantec registry keys
5982369 we have determined that the symprotect feature is involved though this issue is not exclusive to symantec customers to help prevent this issue from occurring you should disable symprotect prior to installing the windows xp sp3 upgrade
5982370 we are still trying to understand why the upgrade is adding these keys
5982371 fixccs exe adds registry keys during the sp3 update process and then attempts to delete them
5982372 symprotect prevents changes to the registry keys thus it prevents the deletion of the keys added by fixccs exe
5982373 weve seen reports from various users who are not running symantec products
5982374 i am encouraged and honored and humbled that my message has reverberated with voters they took a chance on me

5982390 were adding a new network element to our network architecture
5982391 a key message here is that wireless networking is not just about connectivity but about the services that run over the network
5982392 its a whole new way of looking at provisioning applications on networks
5982393 the mse provides a trigger directly to our phone clients
5982394 it gives a combined metric what is equivalent to a link up link down status
5982395 it addresses corner cases and when it comes to customers i think being able to address corner cases is a good thing
5982396 our solution works really well but more information is always welcome
5982397 the process and delivery method of contextual data is very challenging to date you generally dont have an open api and they have to pull the data from a variety of sources
5982398 by abstracting out the services layer and giving that openness to the application community its going to knock down barriers to deploying more innovative mobility applications in the business

5982402 mike fenelon explained that microsofts concern is its contractual agreements with individual companys contribution to wsd scan
5982403 unfortunately microsoft cannot provide wsd scan specification as a whole for the basic starting point of pwg scan service but mike is free to discuss the basic concept of scanning and contribute according to his own knowledge to move the model to the right direction
5982404 but cannot let pwg take the entire wsd scan specification due to the contractual agreement with many companies but there is nothing to prevent an individual company to take whatever it contributed to wsd scan before to pwg scan service if the company chooses so

5982445 it has very limited options and is more limited by the day which is unfortunate considering all the money they are putting into it
5982446 despite the turmoil in the industry we will complete the modernization of our airport
5982447 this is the worst financial crisis in commercial aviation history
5982448 in the future we can expect to see more airlines fail and passengers will see higher fares
5982449 it is a good economic measure and it shows that we are trying to move forward together
5982450 they tend to want to fly in and out of the same airport because it just becomes a habit there is cumulative impact on san jose that is severe

5982453 aku dan ibuku adalah termasuk orang orang yang tertindas dari wanita dan anak anak
5982454 abu rafi budak rasulullah saw berkata aku pernah menjadi budak abbas ketika islam datang maka abbas masuk islam disusul oleh ummu fadhl namun abbas masih disegani terhadap kaumnya
5982455 ini dia abu sufyan bin harits telah datang dari badar
5982456 wahai putra saudaraku beritakanlah bagaimana keadaan manusia dalam perang badar
5982457 demi allah tatkala kami menjumpai mereka tiba tiba mereka tidak henti hentinya menyerang pasukan kami mereka memerangi kami sesuka mereka dan mereka menawan kami sesuka hati mereka demi allah sekalipun demikian tatkala aku menghimpun pasukan kami melihat ada sekelompok laki laki yang berkuda hitam putih berada di tengah tengah manusia demi allah mereka tidak menginjakkan kakinya di tanah
5982458 aku mengangkat batu yang berada di tanganku kemudian berkata demi allah itu adalah malaikat tiba tiba abu lahab mengepalkan tangannya dan memukul aku dengan pukulan yang keras maka aku telah membuatnya marah kemudian dia menarikku dan membantingku ke tanah selanjutnya dia dudukkan aku dan memukuliku sedangkan aku adalah laki laki yang lemah tiba tiba berdirilah ummu fadhl mengambil sebuah tiang dari batu kemudian beliau pukulkan dengan keras mengenai kepala abu lahab sehingga melukainya dengan parah ummu fadhl berkata saya telah melemahkannya sehingga jatuhlah kredibilitasnya kemudian bangunlah abu lahab dalam keadaan terhina demi allah ia tidak hidup setelah itu melainkan hanya tujuh malam hingga allah menimpakan kepadanya penyakit bisul yang menyebabkan kematiannya
5982459 wahai rasulullah saya bermimpi seolah olah sebagian dari anggota tubuhmu berada di rumahku
5982460 mimpimu bagus kelak fatimah melahirkan seorang anak laki laki yang nanti akan engkau susui dengan susu yang engkau berikan buat anakmu qatsam
5982461 wahai ummu fadhl peganglah anak ini karena dia telah mengencingiku
5982462 maka aku ambil bayi tersebut dan aku cubit sehingga dia menangis aku berkata
5982463 wahai ummu fadhl justru engkau yang menyusahkanku karena telah membuat anakku menangis
5982464 jika bayi laki laki maka percikilah dengan air akan tetapi apabila bayi wanita maka cucilah
5982465 lepaslah sarung anda dan pakailah baju yang lain agar aku dapat mencucinya
5982466 yang dicuci hanyalah air kencing bayi wanita dan cukuplah diperciki dengan air apabila terkena air kencing bayi laki laki

5982476 waarom denkt iedereen dat we bij voorbaat kansloos zijn dat is typisch belgisch
5982477 net zoals de klucht rond vincent kompany foto de bond had nooit moeten onderhandelen met de clubs
5982478 dat bewijst dat de kbvb er eigenlijk niet in geloofde dat is erg mocht ik kompany zijn ik zou niet meer komen

5982490 education is an admirable thing but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught
5982491 most people are other people their thoughts are someone elses opinions their lives a mimicry their passions a quotations
5982492 nothing is either good or bad but thinking makes it so
5982493 few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment most people are even incapable of forming such opinions
5982494 the aptly named racecourse was initially known as a horse racing venue and staged its first contest the town purse in 1807 at the time it offered a prize of 20 guineas worth about 3 600 today after about 50 years the races were stopped amid concerns that they encouraged crowd trouble including drunkenness in the 1860s the venue began to be used for autumn sports including donkey races and cycle races as well as horse racing the racecourse was also used by wrexham cricket club and it was the clubs members who formed wrexham football club in 1872 as a way of keeping active during the winter months research shows the football club was formed in the now famous turf hotel which stands just outside the ground and where historians say players used to change for matches the first international football match was held five years later in 1877 when wales lost 2 0 to scotland the following year however wrexham fc won the first ever welsh cup

5982501 the site is fully automated which means theres no requirement for it to be manned or have an adjoining shop
5982502 while this is an unusual system for northern ireland its very simple to use and translates into competitive fuel prices for our customers given the current economic climate we felt it was the right time to introduce it
5982503 while its perhaps a brave move to take on the major multiples were pleased to break their monopolisation of the market and add a bit of healthy competition
5982504 the new forecourt is very easy to use customers simply drive to a pump where theyll be prompted to insert a credit or debit card enter their pin number fill their tank as required replace the nozzle collect a receipt and drive off
5982505 we accept all major credit and debit cards and supply a complete fuel package including premium unleaded ultra low sulphur diesel super unleaded and red diesel so far the response has been fantastic and weve seen a steady stream of customers with many taking advantage of our 24 hour opening
5982506 away from home we have been less than average over a number of years and that is something i have looked at in great detail and it is something we will have to address
5982507 we have to try to get something away from home to go with the good home form weve built up and well continue that
5982508 and for that reason there could possibly be a change of formation against scotland
5982509 i know what my team is and we are shaped up and have the personnel in place
5982510 i think quality wise scotland have some very good players and they are ranked 16th now which is a tremendous achievement
5982511 weve had a good spell ourselves after a tough time but both counties are looking up and enjoying their football and that is what i want to continue and keep the achievements up
5982512 chris baird it has been a frustrating time for him but he has to remain focused and sharp because the call could come at any time either at fulham or another club

5982514 if i was a player who was frozen out for whatever reason i would be using it as a shop window
5982515 it is a wonderful opportunity and a great stage at hampden park and im sure it could be the ideal opportunity for players wanting to move on
5982516 its important to have this game ahead of the world cup qualifiers and especially against our old rivals from the british championship and it is a great game for both countries
5982517 we were concerned because the clowney river and the ballymurphy stream flow down from the west into the blackstaff river which is underneath what is now the broadway underpass these rivers regularly flooded our areas over the years before they were culverted for what is now the underpass
5982518 we the steering group warned the drd that the underpass could flood and that a flyover would be a more suitable alternative but we were given all kinds of assurances by the drd that engineers were working on the issue and that it flooding would never happen
5982519 had the underpass not flooded on saturday st james and the village would have been flooded instead the water coming down the clowney river caused the flooding as it flowed over its banks onto the road and into the underpass
5982520 if this underpass worked as well as we were promised it would then it should have been able to take the water from the clowney river the ballymurphy stream and the blackstaff river
5982521 they drd were quite dismissive of the issue and assured us that it would not be a problem
5982522 i was talking to an engineer working at the underpass yesterday monday and he said only a temporary drainage pump had been installed during the underpass work and it had not been able to cope with the water
5982523 review the design operation and management aspects of the clowney water system with the dbfo company who are responsible for the design and construction of the m1 westlink scheme
5982524 this review will examine the short and longer term arrangements associated with the rivers which resulted in the flooding in this area
5982525 roads service had initially proposed a flyover to link the m1 with the westlink at broadway this matter was considered in detail at a public inquiry into the environmental statement in 2000 and following the recommendations of the independent inspector to the public inquiry the design was changed to an underpass
5982526 the permanent pumping system will also be designed to deal with the run off of normal rain water
5982527 the inundation of the clowney water into the underpass clearly overwhelmed the normal drainage system 10million gallons of water filled the underpass in a period of 45 minutes no pumping system would be capable of dealing with this volume of water in this period of time
5982528 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
5982529 a police officer of seven years on medical leave labelled as a hero for being wounded in the line of duty got up in front of the world and told the world of how he and mr dyer uncovered this creature
5982530 on august 16 the freezer containing the alleged corpse arrived with the searching for bigfoot team
5982531 the ice was being thawed slowly without aid to prevent any decomposition of the alleged corpse we estimated that the freezer and its contents weighed over 1 500lbs and it would take several days or longer to thaw completely
5982532 the following day we were up early to discover that some hair was now exposed i extracted some from the alleged corpse examined it and had some concerns
5982533 we began an expedited melting process within one hour we were able to see the partially exposed head i was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm but unusually hollow in one small section this was yet another ominous sign
5982534 within the next hour of thaw a break appeared up near the feet area as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
5982535 later that day we were informed that mr whitton and mr dyer had admitted it was a costume
5982536 if you see any of those give us a call
5982537 the belfast telegraph has been at the forefront of investigating the petrol price deals available at northern ireland filling stations
5982538 as a result the consumer council has delved into the practices of the major supermarkets at this point in time
5982539 this together with the work of the belfast telegraph on the wide price of fuel gives a very comprehensive picture to consumers of how we are being treated when we go about the costly job of filling our cars
5982540 we will continue to monitor this marketplace so that consumers are kept fully informed
5982541 tesco and sainsburys must stop this punishing local pricing and play fair by all consumers
5982542 the consumer council believes that this practice is blatantly unfair
5982543 unlike asda who offer the same price to all consumers in all their petrol stations tesco and sainsburys need to explain to their customers why their pricing policy for petrol is different from their pricing policy on food where their customers pay the same no matter where they live
5982544 we are confident that the local customer is getting a great deal on fuel
5982545 in addition the retailer recently dropped the price of petrol and diesel by up to 2p per litre on its 6 petrol forecourts across northern ireland
5982546 we must do this because we cannot and will not tolerate innocent people especially children to be victims
5982547 i see this man pulling this long gun from under his shirt and he started shooting i just couldnt believe it some people thought it was firecrackers but i knew different i saw the little girl rubbing her leg and the boy with blood coming out of his head
5982548 opposes juvenile curfews because theyre essentially a violation of fundamental rights of innocent people
5982549 curfews essentially are placing an entire demographic in this case youth under house arrest for the inappropriate actions of a few
5982550 we need to keep the young people off the streets
5982551 and the parents need help the law is the law
5982552 this dude pulled a gun on me last week to take my bike we are moving to atlanta the whole family
5982553 and the mothers are always looking to have fun they dont make time to look after their young ones
5982554 the children cant stay in their homes because of what their mothers are doing behind the bedroom door they are having sex the boys especially have a big problem with that every kid i know who is in trouble its always the same story they cant handle their mothers boyfriends
5982555 i hope it works but i think its going to cause a lot of trouble a lot of kids are going to end up being locked up i bet you
5982556 i just cant be there thats all they cant coop us up like that its not right
5982557 i really dont care about it i will still be outside anyways
5982558 there can be no business as usual under present circumstances
5982559 the future of our relations will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to honour the words of president dmitry medvedev to abide by the six point peace plan which is not happening at the moment
5982560 considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
5982561 full respect for the principles of georgias independence sovereignty and territorial integrity
5982562 this is now the third year of the perennials race day and with the donation of the 28 000 mini bus we are expecting this years event to be even bigger than before we would like to thank all those who have bought tables and everyone is looking forward to what will be a very enjoyable day
5982563 the juror who found this report went looking for it in defiance of what i said
5982564 it is very unfortunate for all those concerned and for the tax payer the chief consideration is that this defendant receives a fair trial
5982565 i grew up with my dad im an only child my father was a cowboy and he really loved me very much but i think he wanted a son occasionally
5982566 im angry it makes me feel like a non person
5982567 i saw him at christmas and birthdays and he provided money for school clothes and he called occasionally
5982568 the fact that weve never been recognised and then cindy has to put such a fine point on it by saying something thats not true
5982569 andersonstown leisure centre avoniel leisure centre and grove wellbeing centre will operate the service from 10am to 5pm every day
5982570 belfast city councils emergency flood helpline 0800 707 6965 will also remain open for the foreseeable future operating 9am to 6pm
5982571 council staff are operating the helpline to give assistance to people in the belfast city council area affected by the weekend flooding
5982572 the council will also put arrangements into place to action any assistance which is being made available by government as soon as details are announced
5982573 he was just looking out to see what was going on when they opened fire and he was hit three times there was no reason for this he wasnt doing anything
5982574 they looted the main shop and then started shooting people
5982575 he had gone to see if he could find any food it was a risky thing to do maybe he shouldnt have gone out but he had to feed his family they killed him because he was a georgian and a young man
5982576 they came in two cars usually a military jeep at the front and a minibus at the back its usually young guys in their early 20s they behave like theyre on a hunting trip
5982577 she doesnt have friends or relatives here but well find somewhere for her to stay
5982578 i am an old man this is all i had all the pictures of my family everything had gone now i have nowhere to live who will look after me
5982579 the russians invaded so they have to take responsibility for what happened on occupied territory this is another srebrenica
5982580 i would not rule out that i said that if they provide such a contraption they should have at least helped out
5982581 a decision was made for the war to start in august the war would have happened regardless of what the georgians did whether they responded to the provocations or not there would have been an invasion of georgia the goal was to destroy georgias central government defeat the georgian army and prevent georgia from joining nato
5982582 he has been calling angela merkel nicolas sarkozy and rice for months and they have all been telling him to stop worrying that the russians wont do anything and theyve basically been ignoring him
5982583 this was a heavy armoured russian column moving slowly on very rugged terrain in the highest mountain range in europe
5982584 think how many hours of preparation assembly then marching it would take for that column moving at that speed on rugged terrain to be at the kurta bridge at six in the morning if that isnt a premeditated invasion i dont know what is
5982585 tskhinvali doesnt exist its like stalingrad was after the war
5982586 any civilised country would act the same way i may remind you that on september 11 the reaction was similar american citizens were killed you know the reaction
5982587 this is not emailing files back and forth as attachments instead youre managing and sharing documents with online storage version control user rights and change notification
5982588 having that year off definitely helped the body out i was able to fix a few things up as well
5982589 its obviously a massive milestone something im very proud of but i probably wont appreciate it until i retire and realise just how hard it is
5982590 jeff white i think wed have to go back and have a look
5982591 weve got some young ruckmen who are coming through and might need yet another year or two to really develop and that might be one thing thats out there

5982595 the punjabi dialogues songs and dances went against the film the bihar distributor paid a whopping amount of money to buy singh is kinng and is now going to lose a hefty amount
5982596 ive heard that the punjabiyat and sikh theme have gone against the films success in bihar but i dont understand why we were aware that some areas would reject the films usp namely the sikh ambience surprisingly the film has done extremely well even in bengal where we thought the audience wouldve trouble connecting with the theme theres really no explanation for what has happened to singh is kinng in bihar
5982597 but jab we met didnt thrust the bhangra culture up audiences throats like it or not the rest of the country is not as fond of punjabi culture as bollywood

5982636 the commissions findings state that the lack of runway capacity is a main reason for what it calls the current poor standards of service and the lack of resilience at times of disruption which results in regular delays
5982637 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa the commission risks delaying
5982638 the competition commission has provisionally found that there are competition problems at each of baas seven uk airports heathrow gatwick stansted and southampton in england and edinburgh glasgow and aberdeen in scotland with adverse consequences for passengers and airlines
5982639 a principal cause is their common ownership by baa there are also competition problems arising from the planning system aspects of government policy and the system of regulation
5982640 the cc is now seeking views on which two of baas three london airports should be sold and similarly which of edinburgh or glasgow airports should be sold
5982641 an extrapolation from athens in 2004 where there were 26 from 3 500 tests and here there will be 4 500 tests
5982642 the ioc was very clear in the lead up to these games that we would work in concert with all the doping authorities the world anti doping agency wada the international federations whom youve all seen have very much upped the ante in terms of the tests they undertook in the build up to these games
5982643 we feel the deterrent effect plays a part in what we see athletes know that at this event the ioc which is the organisation running the doping programmes means business when it comes to not having those who cheat be part of this event
5982644 we will take a further appraisal once the games are completed its not over yet but thats really how we see things at this stage
5982645 we are not privy to that information in terms of those sample collections the medical authorities are doing some 300 or so samples a day up to 350 at their maximum limit

5982705 if you look around the players we have and the experience now a lot of players have of playing in the premier league which is always great in the last four of five years it has certainly got a lot stronger
5982706 we have got a chance it is a tough group theres no question but we have as much of a chance as everyone else
5982707 we will take each game as it comes we will wait for the next couple of games and see what happens but we will certainly have a chance like everyone else has

5982727 spc means finding slopes from the way the surface looks under different illuminations and once we know the slopes we can find the heights
5982728 we suspect that these residuals errors are primarily due to incorrect spacecraft position
5982729 in other words the orbits are not exactly correct we intend to solve for those orbits and then the new orbital data can be used to more accurately determine the bodys gravitational field
5982730 the situation is really bad because of the flood water our life has gone for a toss not only humans even animals are a troubled lot the level of the water is above the danger level we are somehow living in these boats
5982731 the government has not done much to help us we have helped ourselves the children of the village helped us to place the belongings on the rooftop first but when the water level rose further we have got our belongings here and are sitting here
5982732 it s also about making the way they behave to be suitable for a western environment it s not just language it s also what they say and how they say it
5982733 in a series of eye movement studies we showed that social experience has an impact on how people look at faces specifically we noticed a striking difference in eye movements in westerners and east asian observers
5982734 we found that westerners tend to look at specific features on an individuals face such as the eyes and mouth whereas east asian observers tend to focus on the nose or the centre of the face which allows a more general view of all the features
5982735 one possible cause of this could be that direct or excessive eye contact may be considered rude in east asian cultures
5982736 it should probably be a least 30 days but there is pressure to free up the bed for someone else
5982737 hospitals and hospital administrators have traditionally discriminated against mental health conditions and people with them thats principally because of in my view the stigma attached to mental illnesses
5982738 theyre discharging people into the community without the necessary supports you would never discharge a patient with a broken back in need of a wheelchair without a wheelchair
5982739 why should i believe you should be entitled to a new attorney
5982740 im in protective custody and i just got access to the prison law library i just found out that my case has been mishandled
5982741 i dont agree with you ms lyons has worked out a plea agreement which you accepted it appears to me you have had a change of heart
5982742 you told me under oath that you were guilty of your charges
5982743 i hope that you get whatever professional and medical treatment that you need while you are there
5982744 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5982745 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5982746 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5982747 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5982748 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5982749 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5982750 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5982751 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5982752 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5982753 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5982754 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5982755 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5982756 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5982757 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5982758 this is a known iphone bug that is being fixed in the next software update in september
5982759 we can command so much bandwidth that its hard to overwhelm our servers
5982760 we are vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks but right now most of the people who want to do us harm dont have those capabilities
5982761 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5982762 misc regrets to inform that its chemical palm oil tanker mt bunga melati dua has been hijacked by unknown pirates at 2 09 am gmt 2 09pm nz time on august 19
5982763 this is the fourth ship being hijacked in a month in the waters
5982764 we call upon the un to take immediate steps to tackle the worsening problem
5982765 i went to see a plastic surgeon in beverly hills and he told me youve got to be careful with your eyes he advised me against having anything else done he said i should try to look as natural as i can
5982766 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5982767 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5982768 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5982769 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5982770 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5982771 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5982772 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5982773 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5982774 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5982775 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5982776 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5982777 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5982778 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5982779 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5982780 who are open to doing something on the production side
5982781 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5982782 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5982783 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5982784 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5982785 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5982786 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5982787 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5982788 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5982789 tenemos alrededor del 50 de la riqueza mundial pero s lo un 6 3 de la poblaci n
5982790 haced lo que quer is pero lejos de la prensa
5982791 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5982792 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5982793 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5982794 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5982795 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5982796 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5982797 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5982798 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5982799 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5982800 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5982801 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5982802 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5982803 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5982804 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5982805 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5982806 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5982807 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5982808 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5982809 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5982810 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5982811 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5982812 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5982813 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5982814 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5982815 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5982816 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5982817 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5982818 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5982819 we have to fix the system or it will be a long time before the economy recovers
5982820 the general public wants some standards that they can respect and be protected by on a national basis
5982821 invariably somebodys ox gets gored but right now we dont have a uniformed standard and thats part of the problem
5982822 sen casey believes that a disturbing byproduct of the increased rates of foreclosure as shown by these ap stories is an increase in the number unscrupulous individuals who corrupt the appraisal process to artificially inflate home prices to increase profits by cheating home buyers
5982823 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5982824 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5982825 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5982826 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5982827 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5982828 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5982829 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5982830 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5982831 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5982832 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5982833 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5982834 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5982835 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5982836 surgery was always the last resort but unfortunately thats what it came down to
5982837 i am also shattered that i cant lead the australian davis cup team in chile in our bid to rejoin the world group and hope that the boys can still come through with a great win
5982838 the two really exciting things about it are that its a collaboration between several universities and between different corporations
5982839 visualize just how exciting these developments can be there are many many greenhouses throughout the world and if this is a better product it will be utilized
5982840 we think it will produce a lot of jobs thats the whole idea of this program to put people to work now
5982841 i was just hoping my shot hit soft and left a 15 footer for birdie
5982842 i was thinking about maybe being able to take this round low but golf kind of smacked me in the face and brought me back to earth
5982843 if andrei could have tempered his financial appetite it was quite possible he would be playing at the emirates right now
5982844 arsenal were prepared to pay about 15 million for him but they are the only top english club who do not pay large salaries
5982845 we have had strong squads over the years but at the moment it is probably as strong as it has been in the last four or five years definitely
5982846 if you look around the players we have and the experience now a lot of players have of playing in the premier league which is always great in the last four of five years it has certainly got a lot stronger
5982847 we have got a chance it is a tough group theres no question but we have as much of a chance as everyone else
5982848 we will take each game as it comes we will wait for the next couple of games and see what happens but we will certainly have a chance like everyone else has
5982849 i dont think anyone has used excuses in the last few years it just hasnt been good enough as players you take responsibility as a team you have to do that
5982850 experienced players have to help the young lads because football is a team game
5982851 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5982852 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5982853 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5982854 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5982855 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5982856 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

5982873 he has his own reasons for not coming back with ireland hopefully in the future he might come back hes still relatively young and he might come out of retirement or whatever you call the situation that andys in
5982874 i have asked him about it lots of times and hes never said that the doors closed so maybe he will be back in the future theres a chance and it would be great to see him as hed improve the squad hes a top class player
5982875 having spoken to andy about it a lot over the last few months i would never say never he has never said to me for certain that hes finished with ireland and that hes never coming back so theres a chance he might play for ireland again
5982876 hes an irishman hes proud to have played for his country but at the moment its just not right for him to play with us a few months down the line he might feel its right to come back if the manager picks him
5982877 i think he feels he was hung out to dry a bit after that 5 2 defeat in cyprus that was one of the main reasons though not the only one for him backing out of things with ireland hes a big boy and he can take criticism but it was a build up of things not just the criticism that hurt andy and made him step away from the irish squad
5982878 its a fresh start for a lot of people in this squad myself and steven reid were both out for a good while with injury so i know i am determined to stay injury free and stay in the squad for as long as possible
5982879 if i can do that and play well for bolton hopefully the ireland situation will look after itself
5982880 this game is only a friendly but its a big match for us were looking for a good result and a good performance leading into the qualifiers next month
5982881 if i can stay injury free and stay in the bolton team i have a good chance with ireland
5982882 captured in 1971 but it also provided the home for the schools only state playoff appearance in 1999
5982883 it is a very very costly proposal in terms of economic loss cost of business this is going to have a dramatic impact in economic terms for ohioans and we as consumers will pay a huge huge price as a result
5982884 the study says paid sick days would make up just 1 percent of total employee compensation
5982885 but would cost small firms 30 percent of their sales thats difficult to understand
5982886 he is one of the fastest guys on the team
5982887 and we have to have more speed at wide receiver and guys who can consistently make plays
5982888 we put him at receiver in fridays practice and even though he didnt know what he was doing he still made three catches we have two weeks to get him ready and he is going to help us there
5982889 but he is very bright and he is learning quickly its going to be a matter of him learning the offense and the terminology he is pretty natural route runner and he played wide receiver in high school so it is going to be a pretty smooth transition for him
5982890 you look at senior shawn bayes and i love what true freshman chris gilbert is doing right now he had a great catch out here on saturday and he is a track guy junior derek mcbryde can run and he just needs to be more consistent catching the ball junior phil garner is our most consistent receiver and now kirkland gives us another speed guy with senior tight end jameson konz

5982930 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
5982931 so basically i had prophylactic double mastectomies people would say three weeks ago
5982932 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything i just wanted to kind of be rid of this whole thing for me and so this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one

5983001 in our business our webcasts are live with several hundred people online for each event
5983002 nothing can go wrong with the level of clients we serve our reputation is earned every time we conduct a webcast so uptime stability and security are critical to us
5983003 conducted more than 700 webcasts with thousands of hours of live content to thousands of people in more than a dozen countries
5983004 weve grown rapidly and we were looking for a company that provides all the services and technical expertise of planet northstar
5983005 their anticipation advantage methodology helped determine exactly what we needed to create a top notch infrastructure that could scale with our growth and at a budget that was workable for us we expanded our footprint to include additional servers load balancers firewalls san storage managed backup and database management at atitude our core values include being responsive trustworthy and committed to our customers and im impressed our dedicated account team shares these values
5983006 our development of the anticipation advantage enables customers to thoroughly plan their it infrastructure beyond their needs just today
5983007 the methodology also provides key process indicators about when they need to begin scaling which eliminates the worry and frustration many organizations experience in the face of rapid growth equally as important the account team of highly skilled and seasoned experts is always available to customers so they have the confidence that a knowledgeable partner who knows their business is always available to help
5983008 in the last four years the internet has emerged as the best platform for communications and our client base has moved rapidly for both internal and external audiences
5983009 our clients require extensive training both for sales representatives and physicians and theyve found atitude as the perfect solution to meet these needs
5983010 in years past these companies sponsored semi annual meetings for their sales forces but today as new studies emerge or competitive products are announced its critical that they have new data immediately so they rely on our services to meet that demand
5983011 at the same time if one of these companies hosts physicians at an event anywhere in the world they can webcast with us from any venue and we can support the requirement since our connections are incredibly robust with our capabilities we make their lives much easier
5983012 as our international business grew i knew it was the right direction for our company weve seen other companies emerge in brazil and they appear to do a good job until the participants begin to load its there they fail our speed and reliability set us apart which makes our offering highly competitive

5983033 on our radar we had two vessels that we knew had been taken by pirates
5983034 so the threat is real its almost eerie coming down that coast and seeing a radar contact with a name on it and knowing that those vessels are held by pirates
5983035 the crews lives are in danger and ransoms of millions of dollars are being demanded from the companies who own them
5983036 the danger with getting too close or attempting to contact the seized ships is if we threaten them they may think that were the navy special forces coming in to try to do a rescue and the next thing weve got is dead hostages
5983037 they clearly know the ocean a little bit and they go out in some pretty bad weather and manage to get on board these big ships
5983038 they typically will threaten the ships by firing rocket propelled grenades small arms or mortars at them so they show that force get them to slow down and they have built ladders that they hook onto the sides of vessels to get on board
5983039 were going to take this first one up the coast today
5983040 were going to then pick up a large ship coming from south africa off the kenyan coast and take him into mogadishu and come back here for the third one so weve got a busy few days ahead of us here
5983041 there is no pirate that has systems on board that can take on a 1 billion warship
5983042 it simply is a no go for them to try to do that
5983043 none of the other countries ships that have been doing this have ever even seen pirates
5983044 for small boats a warship of this size this well armed its extraordinarily unlikely pirates would approach it and if they do i dont believe theyll even get anywhere close to the world food program ships the visual presence will probably scare them off before anyone has to actually do anything

5983080 the disaggregation of the softswitch is playing to the advantage of equipment makers that developed softswitches for greenfield ip environments those softswitches from sonus veraz metaswitch and others were designed around the sip protocol as opposed to those that were largely ip enabled versions of tdm switches
5983081 it is much more difficult for equipment makers to break apart a softswitch with tdm dna than it is for a vendor that relied on sip as the major ingredient
5983082 the current trend is actually in keeping with the original blueprints for the softswitch which called for a much more granular separation of functionality than simply splitting the platform into signaling and media hemispheres

5983089 i worked in the gaming website design internet marketing field for two years before going solo
5983090 and business finally started to bloom big time when i learned to harvest the power of search engine optimization with my gaming website design sites ranking higher than ever my profits soared
5983091 i followed the great gaming website design webmasters guide by buchauer vang who details some simple website plans that one can build from readily available templates
5983092 many corporate legal firms like pistone huge inc offer turn key solutions for webmasters that sell nationwide
5983093 and this can eliminate a lot of stress right away many firms plug you right into their gaming website design payment processing division and youre up and running legally within a couple short weeks
5983094 also dont forget that your gaming website design marketing can beging from day one start getting links from authority sites and coordinate press releases
5983095 you dont want to inadvertently steal someone elses hard work
5983096 but at the same time you have to cite your sources so that your claims to gaming website design knowledge are based on fact
5983097 when my website got going i soon received many offers from foreign companies with stolen email lists and sleazy marketing methods they promise quick riches the easy way but in fact there is no easy way to making bank in the gaming website design field it comes down to creativity and hard work

5983158 i am delighted that we have found the location for our new blade factory and we look forward to beginning operation in our first manufacturing cluster in the usa
5983159 i am confident we will maintain our good relationships with the authorities in brighton and weld county as we continue to develop this new vestas site
5983160 we are extremely pleased to be building vestas largest nacelle assembly factory to date denver and the surrounding areas give us direct access to a large qualified workforce and this was one of the primary reasons for choosing brighton
5983161 our new factory will be designed according to the most efficient lean manufacturing principles and we expect brighton to become the center for vestas nacelles activities in the usa
5983162 on behalf of the people of colorado i am grateful that vestas has chosen to once again invest in our state
5983163 this is a tremendous boon for all of colorado not just brighton by bringing more than 1 350 additional jobs here vestas is cementing its standing as one of colorados pioneering partners in the new energy economy i look forward to continuing the relationship for years to come my administration has worked closely with vestas to make the brighton project a reality this only adds momentum to our efforts to diversify our economy and grow these modern energy industries of the future
5983164 vestas increased manufacturing and r amp d footprint in the usa will enable us to even better serve our north american customer base
5983165 as of today the united states congress has still not extended the federal production tax credit but vestas believes they will take action wind power is poised to become a major form of energy generation in the usa and vestas is positioning itself to meet the demands of a rapidly growing market for wind power
5983166 vestas is very committed to the uk market and has been present from the very start of wind energy in great britain
5983167 we are also very pleased that the british government now has recognised this and will ensure that wind power will contribute significantly to the fulfilment of uks european 15 per cent target for renewables towards 2020
5983168 i am pleased that vestas has recognised the huge investment opportunity that our plans for a dramatic increase in renewable energy present
5983169 the isle of wight is set to become a major hub for innovation and the manufacture of blades for some of the 7 000 new wind turbines needed to meet our ambitious targets

5983180 this is really good news it was more than i expected
5983181 at that time the national park service had a somewhat different philosophy about where to place visitors centers it was to put them as close as possible to historic resources
5983182 had the expansion gone forward that would be the issue it would be a bigger blemish

5983186 we are hopeful that usepa will carefully examine this information and respond accordingly

5983204 felipe has learnt a lot about terry in the last few weeks he knows how much the england captaincy means to him thats why he spoke with capello he told capello that terry is a natural leader and someone who other big players at chelsea react well to and respect

5983215 the developed nations have pioneered in improving customer experience by adapting ip pbx and use of applications like voicemail follow me conferencing auto attendant and operator panel the ip pbx has already taken over the traditional pbx in the west and is growing fast we believe that enterprises in india today serve global needs and compete globally
5983216 thus there is need of communication systems that put them ahead in this race but are affordable at the same time drishti intends to bridge this gap by bringing a highly reliable feature rich solution to the indian enterprises freepbx offering from drishti is a step forward in this direction we will be going to the market through channels with local support available in all major cities
5983217 the question in this case is whether permitting authorities may supplement inadequate monitoring requirements when epa has taken no action
5983218 if the monitoring isnt good enough the whole system falls apart
5983219 affects every major stationary air pollution source in the country this is a very important case just in terms of the publics right to know and guarding the publics opportunity to keep tabs
5983220 determine the appropriate course of action once the review is complete we are still assessing the implications of the decision
5983221 is a complex statute with a clear objective it enlists epa and state and local environmental authorities in a common effort to create a permit program for most stationary sources of air pollution
5983222 by its terms this mandate means that a monitoring requirement insufficient to assure compliance with emission limits has no place in the permit unless and until it is supplemented by more rigorous standards
5983223 we began to realise that we had something very special
5983224 as a result he has been an indoor cat and has a chip installed in case he gets lost
5983225 yoda is so different that we were concerned that he might be catnapped
5983226 people do a double take when they see him or his picture it is great fun showing him off
5983227 we have actually had people ask if we had his ears cut to look this way but he is a perfectly normal affectionate curious cat and is a joy to have around
5983228 they are doing this for no other reason than to make money
5983229 we dont want to be pacified we want the movie as promised this november
5983230 i would not consider frosted flakes the food of an olympian
5983231 i would rather see him promoting fiber one i would rather see him promoting oatmeal i would even rather see him promoting cheerios
5983232 for a guy like michael phelps who isnt worried about obesity because hes burning thousands of calories as an athlete eating corn flakes and frosted flakes every so often is not an issue
5983233 with the exception of peak periods i think normally we would be looking at a 299 dollar fare from kuala lumpur to london so all in a return flight of within 1000 dollars the herald sun quoted osman rani as saying
5983234 that would probably be in the first half of next year as soon as we get our uk service going he added
5983235 its a very impressive building absolutely magnificent it could have been seen for miles around
5983236 i extracted some hair from the alleged corpse and examined it and had some concerns
5983237 we burned said sample and said hair sample melted into a ball uncharacteristic of hair
5983238 within one hour we were able to see the partially exposed head i was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm but unusually hollow in one small section this was yet another ominous sign
5983239 within the next hour of thaw a break appeared up near the feet area i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
5983240 at this time action is being instigated against the perpetrators of this fraud
5983241 on behalf of myself i can say with certainty matthew whitton and ricky dyer are not the best bigfoot trackers in the world
5983242 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything
5983243 i just wanted to kind of get rid of this whole thing for me
5983244 this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
5983245 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
5983246 im going to have cute boobs til im 90 so theres that
5983247 ill have the best boobs in the nursing home ill be the envy of all the ladies around the bridge table
5983248 and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really upset you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes and i think that its all part of the healing
5983249 if this had been caught a year from now or when i was 40 i probably wouldnt be able to live through this
5983250 astounded to see that the measure could predict aggressive behaviour in a real world setting
5983251 if someone was given the choice of one of two opponents to compete against who differed on the basis of the facial metric would the facial metric predict the less aggressive opponent
5983252 in a series of eye movement studies we showed that social experience has an impact on how people look at faces specifically we noticed a striking difference in eye movements in westerners and east asian observers
5983253 we found that westerners tend to look at specific features on an individuals face such as the eyes and mouth whereas east asian observers tend to focus on the nose or the centre of the face which allows a more general view of all the features
5983254 one possible cause of this could be that direct or excessive eye contact may be considered rude in east asian cultures
5983255 by disproving the long held assumption that face processing is universally achieved we have highlighted that the external environment including the society in which we develop is very influential in basic human mechanisms and caution should be taken when generalizing findings to the entire human population

5983265 there was a time when i spoke pejoratively of armchair astronomers and ive gotten up at a star party and publicly apologized for that
5983266 this is the last friendly before the world cup qualifiers and there will not be a lot of experiments but i have the possibility to get to know better some players like emile heskey
5983267 it is the first time ive picked him in the squad
5983268 the captain cannot play if he is limping of course but the fact someone is captain does not make him undroppable
5983269 it was not an easy choice to make because rio ferdinand is a very important player and i like him as a captain but i chose john because i think we need one captain with a big personality in every moment
5983270 he is important on the pitch but also in the dressing room and around the squad
5983271 john will be the driver of this team it was important for me to get to know the players and then choose who the captain would be
5983272 rio will be the vice captain and john will not be sure to play but for me the first xi are always the best players at that moment for me
5983273 i honestly didnt know anything until about an hour before the announcement
5983274 with the competition for places and the players who were up for the armband it makes it extra special
5983275 the captain cannot play if he is limping of course but the fact someone is captain does not make him undroppable
5983276 it was not an easy choice to make because rio ferdinand is a very important player and i like him as a captain but i chose john because i think we need one captain with a big personality in every moment
5983277 he is important on the pitch but also in the dressing room and around the squad
5983278 john will be the driver of this team it was important for me to get to know the players and then choose who the captain would be
5983279 rio will be the vice captain and john will not be sure to play but for me the first xi are always the best players at that moment for me
5983280 i honestly didnt know anything until about an hour before the announcement
5983281 with the competition for places and the players who were up for the armband it makes it extra special
5983282 of course there were some frustrated players but the only way for them to vent their frustrations is to train well and put their hat in the ring for the blackburn game
5983283 on saturday the decision was based on who was tiring and who might bring us pace
5983284 that doesnt mean to say that therell never be a place for dean windass to start thats for sure
5983285 the dream of chelsea is broken because real madrid will not even negotiate
5983286 we have three mainline strikers in valeri vass and benjani out for a significant period the other two could be out for two to three months as well as valeri being out for six
5983287 we need to address the situation that we now find ourselves in
5983288 i havent changed my mind i want to join everton
5983289 we are still in contact i hope now that rennes will accept to enter into negotiations with this english club
5983290 he has worked exceptionally hard to get back to the level he was at before sundays incident but his personality and his demeanour will be a big help
5983291 hes a naturally buoyant character and he will need that because obviously there is a lot of hard work ahead of him he understands that but hes being positive and was starting to get things organised with the medical staff on sunday
5983292 the lack of faith in europe is obviously more widespread than in the early 1990s with 68 percent in favour 18 to 25 year olds are the only age group in the dutch population to be truly enthusiastic about europe
5983293 because research has confirmed that greenery and space in the general sense are calming and contribute to recovery from stress
5983294 an untidy collection of concrete noise screens houses and office colossuses
5983295 we have had strong squads over the years but at the moment it is probably as strong as it has been in the last four or five years definitely
5983296 if you look around the players we have and the experience now a lot of players have of playing in the premier league which is always great in the last four of five years it has certainly got a lot stronger
5983297 we have got a chance it is a tough group theres no question but we have as much of a chance as everyone else
5983298 we will take each game as it comes we will wait for the next couple of games and see what happens but we will certainly have a chance like everyone else has
5983299 i dont think anyone has used excuses in the last few years it just hasnt been good enough as players you take responsibility as a team you have to do that
5983300 experienced players have to help the young lads because football is a team game
5983301 the best values from trusted sellers become better and better
5983302 i have no control i have to comply with anything they choose to do and i have no voice in the matter
5983303 id be giving up a months income to get that done thats the only thing thats keeping me on ebay the inconvenience of leaving
5983304 i talk to other people who have done what i did and theyre happy with their decision theyve been able to get their business to the ebay business levels or beyond
5983305 many times you feel like theyre really pushing it to see if youll give them some kind of a refund
5983306 theyll float the suggestion that this isnt exactly what i expected
5983307 when ebay makes these dramatic changes it can make you very nervous
5983308 but again ebay is doing what ebay believes it has to do to protect its marketplace

5983324 he has his own reasons for not coming back with ireland hopefully in the future he might come back hes still relatively young and he might come out of retirement or whatever you call the situation that andys in
5983325 i have asked him about it lots of times and hes never said that the doors closed so maybe he will be back in the future theres a chance and it would be great to see him as hed improve the squad hes a top class player
5983326 having spoken to andy about it a lot over the last few months i would never say never he has never said to me for certain that hes finished with ireland and that hes never coming back so theres a chance he might play for ireland again
5983327 hes an irishman hes proud to have played for his country but at the moment its just not right for him to play with us a few months down the line he might feel its right to come back if the manager picks him
5983328 i think he feels he was hung out to dry a bit after that 5 2 defeat in cyprus that was one of the main reasons though not the only one for him backing out of things with ireland hes a big boy and he can take criticism but it was a build up of things not just the criticism that hurt andy and made him step away from the irish squad
5983329 its a fresh start for a lot of people in this squad myself and steven reid were both out for a good while with injury so i know i am determined to stay injury free and stay in the squad for as long as possible
5983330 if i can do that and play well for bolton hopefully the ireland situation will look after itself
5983331 this game is only a friendly but its a big match for us were looking for a good result and a good performance leading into the qualifiers next month
5983332 if i can stay injury free and stay in the bolton team i have a good chance with ireland

5983373 i found out about it when the deal was almost finalized and i couldnt back out at that point
5983374 they kind of ticked me off telling me i had to build by such and such a time right now i basically feel like ive complied with the order i put a very secure fence around it
5983375 the order against it is overdue and the county will be moving forward to clear up the property if the present owner doesnt want to comply with the order and that cost will be billed to the property owner
5983376 tatamagouche is a nice neat and tidy village and it does need to be maintained to that standard
5983377 i almost had to laugh there are things overlooked all over the village theres a set of stairs on main street missing a handrail and id need two portable washrooms
5983378 im not trying to be vindictive but this is ridiculous
5983379 theres no way kids can walk down that road its far too dangerous
5983380 the kids should feel safe walking to their new school

5983394 the federal government had a role to play and turned that over to the province in 1970 but with the onset of global warming and rising sea levels and tides i believe the national government has to become a partner again like they were in the past
5983395 based on the challenges i saw at the aboiteau repair project in cumberland county last week and knowing that the bay of fundy has the worlds highest tides i am concerned that if both governments dont reach a new partnership on repairing and strengthening our dike system soon then i suspect nova scotians will pay dearly for years to come
5983396 we all know what happened in new orleans after hurricane katrina and we dont want that to happen here
5983397 the aboiteau is just a precursor of things to come and if we have failures in dikes and dont have the expertise and technology to fix and replace them then we could be in serious trouble
5983398 we have to create our own technology and once the assessment is done we have to decide how were going to fix the dikes
5983399 thats going a little too far i dont see the highway or the rail line being in danger

5983408 we look forward to brett rejoining the group as soon as possible
5983409 the selectors are comfortable this move will maintain the competitive edge for the australian side
5983410 and provide a wonderful opportunity for brett to join the australian group for the first time
5983411 we are an office appointed under the constitution of kenya until the constitution is amended to bring us within the ambit of contract and performance anything else that comes will be unconstitutional
5983412 they can investigate me there is nothing wrong with that and if i have gone wrong somewhere there is a provision in the constitution and that should be followed
5983413 it is easier to see president kibaki than the chief justice i wonder how he thinks the problems in the judiciary can be solved when he doesnt want to talk to stakeholders
5983414 there is the need for the community to partner with the teachers to assure childrens safety as well as change of mental attitude in children themselves
5983415 i am going to routinely visit all these schools just in case there is a headteacher who has not installed these equipment i expect heads to move fast
5983416 these will not have the usual one or two teachers for counselling we will have all teachers taken for an in service training to act as counsellors
5983417 children have not been given thorough guiding and counselling regarding what happened just like most adults had not been counselled
5983418 who can testify to the truth of what is writ therein
5983419 at the start of games youll see teams come out with a lot of energy then as the game goes on we keep it turned on and we wind up wearing people down
5983420 were not afraid to get on someone if someones not playing defense
5983421 when you look at all the other teams that have been together for so long they can talk to each other
5983422 i dont think theres another team in this tournament that can play defense the way we can in terms of the style of defense
5983423 because we can get after it positions one through five can get after it
5983424 his voice helped last summer when he began talking more on the defensive end hes continued to be our quarterback on defense
5983425 theyre offensive minded players the things they need to do here usually they have someone on their nba teams that does it for them
5983426 were asking them to commit on the defensive end of the floor all of them can score but will they play both ends
5983427 we wanted them to open up and talk so we wanted them to have a bond and not be afraid
5983428 i think its not that theyre a lot better individually
5983429 as a team theyre working better together theyre more intense that they were in past years theyre playing with a purpose thats to win and show everyone theyre superior
5983430 i think something a lot of teams were hoping was that wed get a little lethargic or a little complacent
5983431 everybody trusts coach obrien he knows what hes doing whatever his decision is were going to be ready for it and move on

5983439 on behalf of the government the people of kenya and on my own behalf l extend our heartfelt condolences to you personally and through you to the bereaved family the government and people of zambia
5983440 during struggle for plural politics in zambia the late mwanawasa played a pivotal role and was not only a source of inspiration and encouragement to the people but also displayed tremendous powers of the application of the rule of law
5983441 its not worth the risk in this to do something running around and pull it when its not 100 percent and be out four or five weeks

5983445 a format comparable to paper based information unless the commissions rules explicitly require it
5983446 its a better way to provide information to investors because today it can be presented in an interactive format that allows each individual to click through or drill down to the level appropriate to him or her
5983447 we recognize that allowing companies to present data in ways different from our current forms and in more technologically advanced ways than edgar can be a significant help to investors
5983448 man hat alles versucht aber er anm steiner hat berhaupt keinen kontakt gesucht
5983449 ich freu mich mit ihm weil ich daran immerhin acht jahre mitgearbeitet und ihn bis 2004 unterst tzt habe und von anderen vereinsfunktion ren deshalb angefeindet worden bin ich hab immer gesagt wenn er seine einstellung beh lt wird er olympiasieger so jemanden haben wir seit walter legel nicht mehr gehabt
5983450 wir mussten steiner 2005 sagen dass wir uns von salama trennen das hat ihm nicht gefallen er hat gemeint er kann ohne ihn keine leistungen bringen nur er k nne ihn motivieren
5983451 ich habe das wichtigste in meinem leben verloren was h tte ich noch zu verlieren gehabt
5983452 worauf ich mich jetzt am meisten freue ist die sachertorte meiner mama

5983457 ivanhoes announced intention to seek leave to appeal does not affect our determination to complete the restructuring on our announced proposed timetable
5983458 if ivanhoe or any other party takes any steps to delay the completion of the restructuring pending the supreme courts determination we will resist those attempts
5983459 when they have a conflict like that it increases the likelihood that they will be able to convince them the supreme court to hear it
5983460 offer an umbrella to all the persons within its orbit by permitting them to shelter themselves from any recourse
5983461 the move will better protect the interests of the olympic gold medalists
5983462 were advised to give it to the medalist as a gift
5983463 when there was a breakdown in talks in 2006 it took the momentum out of the industry
5983464 if these talks had failed for whatever reason it would have taken the momentum right out of the industry
5983465 is extremely important it reconfirms that there is an industry going forward here for the next 30 or 40 years
5983466 theyre all whiners who complain that theyre not paid enough
5983467 the people that make this agency the finest in the world and one that money cant buy and whos integrity cannot and will not be compromised
5983468 if there is a trend or dynamic toward lower oil prices venezuela will consider the possibility of a cut in production
5983469 this is the position that we will take at the next opec meeting
5983470 i dont think any decision is going to be made but i wont be surprised at the rhetoric and traders are looking at it
5983471 i had to give up sweet iced tea i love sweet iced tea
5983472 but it was putting body fat on me which was slowing me down now i drink water i miss my tea but if itll make us a better team im going to keep drinking that water
5983473 everyone is making sacrifices wed never even thought about before
5983474 weve got to see theres a payoff for all of this work
5983475 almost everything has changed fast for these players but theres got to be a change in the record for them to know its all going to work
5983476 the best values from trusted sellers become better and better
5983477 i have no control i have to comply with anything they choose to do and i have no voice in the matter
5983478 id be giving up a months income to get that done thats the only thing thats keeping me on ebay the inconvenience of leaving
5983479 i talk to other people who have done what i did and theyre happy with their decision theyve been able to get their business to the ebay business levels or beyond
5983480 many times you feel like theyre really pushing it to see if youll give them some kind of a refund
5983481 theyll float the suggestion that this isnt exactly what i expected
5983482 when ebay makes these dramatic changes it can make you very nervous
5983483 but again ebay is doing what ebay believes it has to do to protect its marketplace
5983484 there could be a dip of 5 per cent in our margins this year
5983485 with majority of the fresh capacities being added to the industry in the second half of the current financial year the capacity utilisation for the industry will drop to 90 per cent in fy09
5983486 in fy10 we foresee that the utilisation will drop further down to 85 per cent
5983487 we estimate that in fy10 similar quantity of capacities will be added
5983488 demand growth is less than what we had estimated real estate is looking down spending on infrastructure projects is not that what we estimated
5983489 in fy09 there will be a growth of 7 8 per cent but in next financial year there will be some pick up as growth story is intact in india we are relying on volume growth and not on the prices
5983490 while area under cultivation has shrunk it will not have much impact on the output as more than 80 per cent of farmers have planted bt cotton this year
5983491 if andrei could have tempered his financial appetite it was quite possible he would be playing at the emirates right now
5983492 we have had meetings to try to get it into our heads that every game is a cup final with england
5983493 we have got to go out there and play well win the game and take that into the qualifiers
5983494 watching the euros on tv i thought it would have been great to be there and having been to a world cup i know what to expect
5983495 i said right from the start that spain would win it
5983496 cesc who was brilliant throughout the tournament he was buzzing when he came back to arsenal
5983497 its always good to have a trophy winner coming back into the changing room
5983498 it gets everyone on a high to see his face when he came back to training for the first time just shows what a big player he is and what he did for spain
5983499 i really enjoyed being out in trinidad and to get a run out for 20 minutes was great
5983500 i really enjoyed it and it shows the hard work ive put in
5983501 for the consumer at the end of the day what really matters is what can i do with the phone
5983502 if android allows you to do things you cant do otherwise and its better then consumers will start to say i know what this is and i want it thats going to be hard to get to that point
5983503 to me the key variable is really not so much android its your big mobile phone operators that command most of the market share and how are they going to act and react
5983504 i think the idea behind android is a good one the idea of having an open platform but at the same time phones are different from computers most people dont realize their phone has an os on it much less care about what os it has
5983505 really the success of a platform boils down to the developers
5983506 when youre sitting at zero handsets developers have to make their bets
5983507 one would think that google with their very broad reach and very good branding would be at lots of advantages with respect to distribution their open nature might mean they have a pretty good rev share model in place for the developers
5983508 i think a lot of the developers are betting that its worth playing with the android platform
5983509 it may as well be the only phone in the world if youre google youve got to match that and if not do better be cheaper one or the other
5983510 surgery was always the last resort but unfortunately thats what it came down to
5983511 i am also shattered that i cant lead the australian davis cup team in chile in santiago from 19 21 september in our bid to rejoin the world group and hope that the boys can still come through with a great win
5983512 i am looking forward to playing again in january in my home country and using that as a springboard to compete at my best again on the world stage for at least a couple of more years
5983513 we came out this afternoon and worked a lot on special teams
5983514 we got maybe 40 minutes work on special teams and then some situations coming out from the minus 1 how to end the game in what we call kill the clock offense and get the ball back on defense and then two minutes then we did some walk through stuff for our opener so it was a pretty short practice last two a day so im sure that the players are fired up about that
5983515 we got a lot of really good work on special teams
5983516 a lot of detail work and then hit some things that you have to spend time on that you dont really have time to do like sky kicks onside hands team all the things you have to have ready for that first game
5983517 i made it i finally won a gold medal i cant stop smiling im so excited
5983518 but i go by everything happens for a reason and for some reason the judges were giving me scores im not used to but they had a reason
5983519 it did upset me a little but i thought about it and i decided i was at the olympic games i was having the time of my life and im winning medals
5983520 when you do get silver you feel different emotions but i looked back and appreciated that i had a medal
5983521 if it were gold it might feel differently i dont know how to explain it i definitely came to appreciate it i wouldnt trade my silver medals for anything in the world not even gold
5983522 the more mistakes you make in practice the more you worry
5983523 i wanted to do my best routine i didnt want to leave the olympics thinking i could do better
5983524 at this point in time i think this is one of the most cost effective ways to reach the largest number of potential customers
5983525 with some talented developers and a unique concept even a small company can launch a useful and or memorable application the challenge is creating an app that is unique and truly appeals to your target market ultimately the success of a branded app depends on its ability to deliver functionality that inspires the initial download encourages frequent and long term usage and creates a positive brand image
5983526 we realize how important perfecting the code is before launching a glitch in our first version resulted in some poor user reviews we now realize the obvious even if its a silly game an application is still an extension of ones brand getting everything right the first time is very important
5983527 we havent really got our game plan exactly complete yet were going to sure try to do things that theyre good at doing
5983528 nothing to do with freedom of speech or the right to protest
5983529 i like the way he handles a broad range of subjects in an engaging and friendly manner definitely one of the good guys
5983530 right wing blogging from a uk student a fresh perspective on a plethora of events with a healthy interest in shelf stacking to boot
5983531 one of the more depressing aspects of blogging and the modern world is seeing reams of text on a page the thunder dragons mixture of politics and fun posts with good illustrations and quickly made points makes his blog an accessible and fun place to discuss and think about politics the thunderdragon is one of the rising stars of conservative blogging

5983533 the thunderdragon consistently provides an interesting and enjoyable read always entertaining and often insightful his writing may even give us a foretaste of our political future stick with him after all time will cure his youth
5983534 the politburo has unanimously decided to expel somnath chatterjee from the membership of the party with immediate effect
5983535 we communists have to abide by party rules the party will severe all connections with those who do not follow party diktats we cannot keep him as speaker mr somnath chatterjee might have acted according to the indian constitution but our party has its own constitution and decisions are taken as per party rules
5983536 we give the room a bit of a romantic atmosphere its fine dining but with a more casual attitude
5983537 our csu hops are fully mature and even with a stormy spring were expecting nearly twice as much yield as last year

5983539 comenzaron a recorrer cada una de las regiones sanitarias para pedir la documentaci n necesaria para gestionar el pase a planta
5983540 hay cerca de 13 000 auxiliares y cerca de 3 000 enfermeros profesionales el tema es c mo relacionar la cantidad de enfermeros con la cantidad de camas que hay en la provincia que son cerca de 25 000
5983541 adem s explic hay que desagregarlo por complejidad de camas no es lo mismo una cama asilar que una polivalente un paciente cr nico que hace cuatro o cinco meses que est en un hospital necesita una atenci n diferente a la de un polivalente donde hay una rotaci n de la cama muy importante porque pasan pacientes agudos el d ficit depende de c mo se lo quiera aplicar confrontar o estudiar
5983542 los que hay no quieren ir a trabajar a un lugar que tenga riesgos no es tan f cil como aumentar en mil la cantidad de enfermeros o de m dicos porque hay lugares donde no quieren ir y no se les puede pagar mucho m s a ellos porque se genera un efecto domin y despu s no me alcanza el presupuesto para pagarle al resto
5983543 no hay sistema que pueda funcionar con uno de cada tres agentes faltando
5983544 tenemos que volver a motivar a la gente y adem s pagarle mejores sueldos ese es un tema que vamos a tener en cuenta nos gustar a volver a motivar a la gente m s all del dinero que puedan ganar o que puedan conseguir a trav s de paritarias
5983545 desde el punto de vista ideol gico en medicina sanitaria es reforzar definitivamente la atenci n primaria de la salud
5983546 los lugares donde hay pobreza m s dura concretamente a cada una de las casas
5983547 es un dolor tan grande que no lo puedo explicar
5983548 es duro enfrentar una situaci n como esa ante argentina
5983549 mi papel como capit n es estimular la motivaci n del grupo y es eso lo que har nuestro objetivo era buscar la medalla de oro desafortunadamente no se pudo y ahora tenemos que levantar la cabeza y seguir adelante

5983556 yeah i expected the other three to qualify and the last place to be between me
5983557 ive hammered christian during the year but he ran a great bend and hes just got better with every race i think his injury troubles are finally behind him hes finding his groove again for the first time in years
5983558 hes found it just at the wrong time for me
5983559 ive clearly improved and come on another level this has probably come a year too early but it was a good championship for me
5983560 i knew 20 25 would probably make it and it did from both heats but i just didnt have that extra gear and i was moving up a class again
5983561 generally i think i was just a touch down most of the race it was just a tiny tiny fraction but i was fifth off the bend where id hoped to be fourth maybe and then tightened up
5983562 i had a great time out there i said id enjoy every minute of it because it doesnt come around very often theres 91 000 people there but you dont really see them until you finish
5983563 yeah i suppose so because how close can you be one place but i couldnt do any more ive improved and improved this year i ran 20 3 twice here and maybe next time i can run 20 2 twice
5983564 ive tried so hard and havent made it but im the number two european here a metre off the final against the best jamaicans and americans so i cant be too disappointed
5983565 i havent messed up ive just been a metre short

5983568 disconcerting as it may be to true believers in global warming the average temperature on earth has remained steady or slowly declined during the past decade despite the continued increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and now the global temperature is falling precipitously
5983569 the reason this matters is that there is a close correlation between variations in the sunspot cycle and earths climate the previous time a cycle was delayed like this was in the dalton minimum an especially cold period that lasted several decades from 1790 northern winters became ferocious in particular the rout of napoleons grand army during the retreat from moscow in 1812 see picture was at least partly due to the lack of sunspots
5983570 i dont know how many games russia lost in that 2006 tournament but it didnt matter that made beating us their souvenir it didnt even matter to them that they came in second
5983571 they beat us and that was it we knew that but to actually experience it to hear the entire gym including the australian players in the stands cheer for russia to actually experience that is different than knowing it or being aware of it
5983572 we know shes gonna be there you guys know shes gonna be there shes playing for russia now just like the rest of this team that makes her the enemy
5983573 this is a friend of mine but when we step on the court and shes got the russian colors on like the rest of em
5983574 if you play in this country live in this country and you grew up in the heartland and you put on a russian uniform you are not patriotic person in my mind
5983575 wang xiuying is almost blind and crippled what sort of reeducation through labor can she serve
5983576 but they can also be taken away at any time
5983577 this is part of the tough tactics used to intimidate and silence protesters
5983578 we have no records of these two names in our system
5983579 the realignment of ipgs business entails shifting resources from slower growing businesses to new business opportunities
5983580 in some cases parts of ipgs business will experience reductions while investments will be made in high growth segments of the business
5983581 within ipg we are focused on reducing our costs with ongoing initiatives to improve supply chain efficiency and lower product costs
5983582 we think we can place any qualified technical person who comes out
5983583 how would you feel if our baby came out looking white

5983586 are you excited about the possibility of the us electing its first black president
5983587 well i think of him as black in the american sense
5983588 and really only because of michele i waited to see who the man was married to before i made up my mind about what he was thats how he showed his allegiance
5983589 im just so glad he aint a white looking mulatto like you
5983590 i am the son of a black man from kenya and a white woman from kansas i have brothers sisters nieces nephews uncles and cousins of every race and every hue and for as long as i live i will never forget that in no other country on earth is my story even possible
5983591 most people have never heard of a two headed turtle

5983594 science today effectively does compete with religion insofar as it serves two properly idelogical needs those for hope and those for censorship which were traditionally taken care of by religion in a curious inversion religion is one of the possible places from which one can deploy critical doubts about todays society it has become one of the sites of resistence
5983595 at evaluate we feel it is important for brokers to remain in full control be this in terms of sourcing compliance or links to ancillary services this generation of kfis without lender constraints will result in a more controlled and flexible solution for brokers

5983606 although pan governmental performance on waste reduction has been good some departments still lag behind and we are concerned that targets are not challenging enough
5983607 following their campaign to promote re use and recycling the government must now provide clear and consistent signals that waste reduction is a priority
5983608 we urgently need to identify this unknown lodger who could have vital information to assist the murder investigation and to eliminate him from our enquiries
5983609 not what could be expected of anyone involved in organised crime
5983610 the level of violence used in the killings is completely disproportionate to the level of minor fraudulent activity discovered on the couples computer
5983611 officials concerned are working through the process of putting him on the plane to take him out of the country but if he continues to refuse to leave then he will be confined in the transit area temporarily before being taken into a detention centre
5983612 we look forward to seeing strong bids from each of the competitors for this important franchise

5983614 like everybody else we are trying to see if we can sign people but the hardest thing at the moment is to get somebody to say yes

5983620 the future of joaquin is to be at valencia as he is a valencia player and has a contract with the club
5983621 but if an offer arrives that the club is interested in joaquin will have to listen and also vice versa
5983622 however he came to valencia with a wage ceiling and a big dream which continues and hopefully he still has the fans affection
5983623 people have been unjust with joaquin he is not only interested in money because if he was he would now be in england or italy
5983624 the majority of clinics operating will be in areas where physical isolation from the wards can be maintained

5983644 a second group of spanish olympic athletes has been photographed making slit eyed gestures threatening to overshadow the beijing games with a row over racial stereotyping the photo was discovered on the official website of the spanish tennis federation the latest photo to emerge shows spanish women tennis players pulling the pose apparently in anticipation of their federation cup match against china in april
5983645 pictures of the spanish mens and womens basketball teams making the gesture a crude impersonation of chinese people were published in adverts in spanish newspapers earlier this week the photos which were reprinted around the world added to spanish sports poor reputation for racial sensitivity the latest image appears to show players in spains federation cup team doing the slit eyed gesture along with members of their support staff there is no suggestion that they intended to cause offence

5983700 our challenge is to establish beatthatquote com a brand with a unique service offering and a strong entrepreneurial ethos as the first genuine brand in what is still a very immature market
5983701 the online price comparison marketplace is growing exponentially at the moment but even people who have used one of these websites dont have any kind of relationship with or loyalty to the players which currently dominate the category
5983702 beatthatquote is a young aggressive ambitious company we needed to find an agency partner who would bring to life our offering in an impactful and differentiating way leagus delaney really impressed us
5983703 with such an array of financial products to choose from it can be tempting to turn to a price comparison site to do the legwork for you
5983704 but you might be very confused to find that different sites can give you vastly different quotes and often dont give enough information for you to make an informed choice
5983705 there are various reasons why which may have found quotes differed from site to site for example some comparison sites dont compare as many insurers or products as we do therefore the search results would be different
5983706 its also worth pointing out that this research is nearly two months out of date and since then weve added even more insurers and products to our service and will be adding still more in the very near future
5983707 filed under internet security researchers have revealed that the current military hostilities between russia and georgia may have actually begun online a couple of weeks ago
5983708 tidak jangan demi yang jiwa khaulah berada di tangan nya engkau tidak boleh menjamahku karena engkau telah mengatakan sesuatu yang telah engkau ucapkankan terhadapku sehingga allah dan rasul nya lah yang memutuskan hukum tentang peristiwa yang menimpa kita
5983709 kami belum pernah mendapatkan perintah berkenaan urusanmu tersebut aku tidak melihat melainkan engkau sudah haram baginya
5983710 ya allah sesungguhnya aku mengadu kepada mu tentang peristiwa yang menimpa diriku
5983711 wahai khaulah sungguh allah telah menurunkan al qur an tentang ditimu dan suamimu kemudian beliau membaca firman nya artinya
5983712 sesungguhnya allah telah mendengar perkatan wanita yang mengajukan gugatan kepada kamu tentang suaminya dan mengadukan halnya kepada allah
5983713 segala puji bagi allah yang maha luas pendengaran nya terhadap semua suara telah datang seorang wanita yang mengajukan gugatan kepada rasulullah saw dia berbincang bincang dengan rasulullah saw sementara aku berada di samping rumah dan tidak mendengar apa yang dia katakan maka kemudian allah azza wa jalla menurunkan ayat
5983714 wahai umar aku telah mengenalmu sejak namamu dahulu masih umair umar kecil tatkala engkau berada di pasar ukazh engkau mengembala kambing dengan tongkatmu kemudian berlalulah hari demi hari sehingga memiliki nama amirul mukminin maka bertakwalah kepada allah perihal rakyatmu ketahuilah barangsiapa yang takut akan siksa allah maka yang jauh akan menjadi dekat dengannya dan barangsiapa yang takut mati maka dia kan takut kehilangan dan barangsiapa yang yakin akan adanya hisab maka dia takut terhadap adzab allah
5983715 biarkan dia tahukah kamu siapakah dia beliau adalah khaulah yang allah mendengarkan perkataannya dari langit yang ketujuh maka
5983716 demi allah seandainya beliau tidak menyudahi nasehatnya kepadaku hingga malam hari maka aku tidak akan menyudahinya sehingga beliau selesaikan apa yang dia kehendaki kecuali jika telah datang waktu shalat maka aku akan mengerjakan shalat kemudian kembali mendengarkannya sehingga selesai keperluannya
5983717 ive talked with all the heads of production in los angeles and they are telling me that until the sag issues is settled theyre not going to be green lighting much of anything
5983718 filmport will bring the big budget feature films to toronto what filmport is going to do is attract business into toronto that has otherwise gone to vancouver and montreal because of the lack of studio space
5983719 it will make the city more competitive we feel it will help the city as a whole and even other studios if you have a huge production everybody tends to get a piece of the action
5983720 not only is it going to be a tremendous asset for our screen based industries it shows that the broader industry has great confidence in the future of film and television production in toronto
5983721 a lot of canadian producers say they wont be able to afford to use filmport but if we have the studio space available we will cut a special deal with them to support canadian productions
5983722 wahai anakku aku bukan orang yang tepat untuk mengabulkan permintaanmu itu
5983723 di sela sela itu aku melihat banyak sekali perkara perkara ruhani yang terjadi di luar kebiasaan dari banyak kejadian itu aku berupaya menafsirkannya namun sebagiannya tak berhasil aku ungkap
5983724 akan tetapi buah cita rasa yang tidak lazim ini tidak sama sekali menunjukkan bahwa seluruh sarananya adalah disyariatkan atau sebagiannya yang bernuansa bidah dibolehkan seperti yang kemudian aku teliti lagi
5983725 kesimpulannya saya dulu berkeyakinan bahwa thariqat tarekat jalan marifah penyucian jiwa dan mengetahui rahasia rahasianya adalah dibolehkan secara syariat tidak terlarang sama sekali dan dapat berguna seraya berharap mencapai marifat allah tanpa melakukannya tidak akan mencapai sasaran
5983726 saya sudah menjalani tarekat naqsyabandiyyah mengenal yang tersembunyi dan paling tersembunyi dari misteri misteri dan rahasia rahasianya aku telah mengarungi lautan tasawuf dan telah meneropong intan intan di dalamnya yang masih kokoh dan buih buihnya yang terlempar ombak namun akhirnya petualangan itu berakhir ke tepian damai pemahaman salaf ash shalih dan tahulah aku bahwa setiap yang bertentangan dengannya adalah kesesatan yang nyata
5983727 apakah para ahli tarekat itu memiliki hukum hukum syariat sendiri selain hukum hukum umum untuk seluruh umat islam
5983728 tidak tetapi mereka memiliki niat yang tidak sama dengan niat sembarang orang mereka juga memiliki pandangan yang berbeda dengan pandangan orang orang
5983729 dosa yang dilakukan para ahli tarekat itu lebih besar daripada dosa pelaku maksiat biasa sebab mereka para ahli tarekat telah menganggap mendengarkan kemungkaran dan tarian yang dilakukan bocah bocah tampan dan mulus itu sebagai bentuk ibadah yang disyariatkan sehingga mereka itu telah membuat syariat agama untuk diri mereka yang tidak pernah diperkenankan allah sama sekali tetapi saya tidak pernah tidak mengingkari suatu kemungkaran yang terjadi di hadapan mata saya

5983733 dengan ini aku mengharap dengan sangat agar anda menjadi saksi bahwa kafilah ini dengan semua muatannya berikut kendaraan dan perlengkapannya ku persembahkan di jalan allah azza wajalla
5983734 sungguh kulihat diriku seandainya aku mengangkat batu niscaya kutemukan di bawahnya emas dan perak
5983735 moga moga allah memberkati anda isteri dan harts anda tunjukkanlah letaknya pasar agar aku dapat berniaga
5983736 wahai ibnu auf anda termasuh golongan orang kaya dan anda akan masuk surga secara perlahan lahan pinjamknnlah kekayaan itu kepada allah pasti allah mempermudah langkah anda
5983737 harta abdurrahman bin auf halal lagi bersih dan memakan harta itu membawa selamat dan berkat
5983738 seluruh penduduk madinah berserikat dengan abdurrahman bin auf pada hartanya sepertiga dipinjamkannya kepada mereka sepertiga lagi dipergunakannya untuk membayar hutang hutang mereka dan sepertiga sisanya diberikan dan dibagi bagikannya kepada mereka
5983739 mushab bin umeir telah gugur sebagai syahid ia seorang yang jauh lebih baik daripadaku ia hanya mendapat kafan sehelai burdah jika ditutupkan ke kepalanya maka kelihatan kakinya dan jika ditutupkan kedua kakinya terbuka kepalanya demikian pula hamzah yang jauh lebih baik daripadaku ia pun gugur sebagai syahid dan di saat akan dikuburkan hanya terdapat baginya sehelai selendang telah dihamparkan bagi kami dunia seluas luasnya dan telah diberikan pula kepada kami hasil sebanyak banyaknya sungguh kami khawatir kalau kalau telah didahdukan pahala kebaikan kami
5983740 rasulullah saw telah wafat dan tak pernah beliau berikut ahli rumahnya sampai kenyang makan roti gandum apa harapan kita apabila dipanjangkan usia tetapi tidak menambah kebaikan bagi kita

5983742 demi allah daripada aku menerima jabatan tersebut lebih balk ambil pisau lain taruh ke atas leherku kemudian kalian tusukkan sampai tembus ke sebelah
5983743 aku pernah mendengar rasulullah saw bersabda bahwa anda adalah orang yang dipercaya oleh penduduk langit dan dipercaya pula oleh penduduk bumi
5983744 sesungguhnya aku khawatir dipisahkan dari shahabat shahabatku karena kekayaanku yang melimpah ruah

5983765 the collection is closed because it has come to our attention that there is restricted material in the collection once the collection has been processed it will be open to any patron interested in viewing it
5983766 these folders are restricted via annenberg challenge until further notice
5983767 libraries of course exist not to restrict information but to make it available to the public i would hate to think that uic library was doing anything less than all it could to permit public access to these important materials

5983775 whenever anyone asks us what kind of festival we are we say were a global film festival
5983776 its a good and healthy sign that shows our depth of reach and diversity
5983777 it was maybe getting to the point where some of the smaller films were getting ignored
5983778 its always good to have balance people tend to think that festivals are very heavy and serious i know people are going to have a lot of fun at these films
5983779 what i hope for is that this whole city will plug into the festival in a much stronger way this year
5983780 whether or not you have time to take 10 days or two weeks off to attend the festival you should feel theres a party you can taste
5983781 you try to shut out a lot of things and try to focus on your sport i give a lot of credit to my partner cheryl shes put up with a lot of crap this year and its just good to get this out of the way relax a bit live a normal life and stop making so many sacrifices
5983782 its a fine line you need a lot of luck on your side to be successful
5983783 three weeks ago he has 17 stitches in his foot its why you worry so much anything can happen and it can just destroy your career
5983784 its been a stressful year worrying about that sort of stuff i knew i had another medal in me and i still believe im capable of that gold but i guess the stress is all about the uncontrollables like the random drivers in auckland who want to take you down
5983785 i expended a little bit more energy than i wanted chasing that down and in the end it came back together anyway i thought it was the key move but those are the risks you take
5983786 with 500m to go it was almost a case of deja vu with athens in athens i pushed the pace and i was more hungry for a medal as opposed to gold this time i decided to hang back i knew i had a better sprint than the others but unfortunately the legs were shot
5983787 shane should be proud of what he did yesterday he did an amazing job
5983788 unfortunately our sport is relatively new and financially it would be hard to organise something like that theres just not enough money in the sport for it
5983789 i dont expect to have a fantastic year next year

5983804 the business card is the single most successful networking tool of all time
5983805 for the consumer at the end of the day what really matters is what can i do with the phone
5983806 if android allows you to do things you cant do otherwise and its better then consumers will start to say i know what this is and i want it thats going to be hard to get to that point
5983807 to me the key variable is really not so much android its your big mobile phone operators that command most of the market share and how are they going to act and react
5983808 i think the idea behind android is a good one the idea of having an open platform but at the same time phones are different from computers most people dont realize their phone has an os on it much less care about what os it has
5983809 really the success of a platform boils down to the developers
5983810 when youre sitting at zero handsets developers have to make their bets
5983811 one would think that google with their very broad reach and very good branding would be at lots of advantages with respect to distribution their open nature might mean they have a pretty good rev share model in place for the developers
5983812 i think a lot of the developers are betting that its worth playing with the android platform
5983813 it may as well be the only phone in the world if youre google youve got to match that and if not do better be cheaper one or the other

5983818 we are seeing a perfect storm of negative economic trends threatening working families in the united states
5983819 while gas and food prices are increasing and home values are declining the rise in health care costs is surpassing income growth and fewer people have adequate insurance as a result working people are struggling to pay their bills and accruing medical debt
5983820 the current economic slowdown makes it even more urgent for a new administration to make universal and affordable health insurance a high priority in 2009 to ensure that no american suffers financial hardship as a result of serious illness
5983821 i want somebody who has integrity whos in politics for the right reasons
5983822 i want somebody whos independent somebody whos able to tell me you know mr president i think youre wrong on this and heres why
5983823 i want somebody who is capable of being president who i trust
5983824 im a big believer in winning i dont intend to lose this election john mccain doesnt know what hes up against right now
5983825 senator obama opposes new drilling he said it wont solve our problem and that its not real he is wrong and the american people know it
5983826 the nation is sending 700 billion dollars every year overseas to oil exporting countries that do not like us very much when i am president that is going to stop
5983827 barack obamas tax cuts for ordinary americans are three times larger than john mccains
5983828 the way that john mccains package ends up being three to four trillion dollars more is that they give humungous tax cuts to high income people and large corporations
5983829 in this economy in the past six months with over 400 000 jobs lost weve seen the small businesses those with less than 50 employees add 283 000 jobs
5983830 keep them in a position where they dont have onerous health care costs and mandates to provide expensive benefits to their employees
5983831 it is the mentality of the past eight years to listen to the oil companies that got us into this mess and we have to have a different energy policy to get out of it
5983832 john mccain believes that we have a dangerous exposure to imported oil
5983833 it is his primary objective to put the united states in a position where it is no longer strategically exposed by this dependence
5983834 the first and foremost objective is to change the way americans drive
5983835 a second wave of the foreclosure crisis in the united states

5983837 the two offenders then ran back from the bank and towards their getaway car
5983838 en route one of the men ran towards the third security guard who was positioned across the road adjacent to the getaway car and raised his firearm at the guard and the guard in self defence fired one shot
5983839 we strongly believe the shot from that guards gun hit the person in the chest region and flowing from that the offender dropped his gun
5983840 an autopsy this morning has revealed that the cause of death for this man was a gunshot wound to the chest
5983841 all the preliminary advice to me would place the fact that self defence was certainly an option
5983842 weve been in contact with his manager and supervisors this morning
5983843 i believe there was some emotion running high at auburn hospital predominantly from relatives and friends and i think that can certainly be understood there was a lot of confusion last night and possibly a lot of misinformation

5983845 this community will be discussing what measures will be taken in response to the contempt for democracy that has been reflected in the position by bainimarama
5983846 i think this is a direct and deliberate slight and snub to the leaders of the pacific island countries assembled here in niue we will be discussing today and tomorrow the forum countries reaction to that
5983847 the challenge for us in these meetings is to uphold and stand firmly behind that principle of democracy
5983848 therefore that means holding to account those who violate that principle
5983849 it seems very like the dance we went through with zimbabwe at the commonwealth where eventually as the commonwealth stuck to its guns and its charter and the harare declaration mr mugabe left rather than face his peers
5983850 one hopes that fiji sees the sense in sticking to the commitment it gave to leaders and i would think the message coming out of the forum should be that is what it should be doing
5983851 he tests the strength and relevance of the forum and as a consequence we will have to address that very issue

5983857 princey was prepared to break his arm for us last weekend and that gives you strength and determination to dig deep
5983858 it makes you think youre not going too bad when youve got a guy in your team with a crack in his arm whos prepared to keep turning up for you
5983859 you do your best but these days theres not many places to hide out there
5983860 the cowboys found him a couple of times on the weekend and princey made his tackles
5983861 hell get a lot of confidence out of last weeks game in terms of putting his body in front of people and im sure hes prepared to do it again
5983862 we like to think whether it be princey or anyone else we are there to cover up any mishaps we have and we take that philosophy into the game
5983863 we know what were going to get out of scott and hopefully he knows what he is going to get out of us
5983864 it says a lot about scott he would do that
5983865 its not only what he does on the field its what he brings to our whole dynamics

5984054 last year they picked us at sixth and we got second so it doesnt really mean anything if theyve got us at fourth why not take it further then that
5984055 our goal is to be ready and have all of us on the same page and playing well when we get to october we talked about last year one time and thats it
5984056 it will be a great year to watch because our team is so young and there is so much potential that this is going to be the beginning of a great next four years

5984095 people were complaining about us everywhere in the papers and on the radio
5984096 it was very annoying actually because most of the people hadnt even seen our show but they had seen kath amp kim
5984097 we dont like them because were actually from the west and theyre these fancy rich old comedians making fun of lower class people
5984098 weve always been opposed to that sort of comedy and it really got us thinking about the type of show we wanted to make and thats what weve done in the second series its all about lower class people having cool fantasies and action adventures not just being bogans that people laugh at
5984099 she wanted to punish us for beating her favourite kath amp kim
5984100 thats why it took us so long to come back with a second series she never said as much to our face but it wasnt until she left and the new dude came that we were allowed to make another series
5984101 its been suggested and we are now talking about that in some way i dont know what it will be but we are having a bit of a think about it

5984106 i was being offered lots of stuff but i thought why i have just done what i wanted to do
5984107 we went and lived in turkey and spain went broke
5984108 i said will you go out with me if i see the other person she said yes and that was the last time she ever touched me

5984122 if i were running the abc it would have a 10 oclock timeslot devoted to new talent
5984123 so often you find on campuses where everyone gets caught in their own organizations so focused on doing the work of that organization and a lot of times they try to do it alone
5984124 for me anytime you can put students in a room where they can have some really in depth conversation and really good discussion around how they would like to see things and what they understand about leadership and to challenge one another in a safe environment thats the important part of what we are trying to get at is to create that dialog and i think summit afforded that opportunity
5984125 is it meeting the outcomes we set for it is it the best use of the funds are we meeting as many needs as we can with the resources that are available to us
5984126 it summit gives us a good networking possibility with other groups we dont normally interact with all the time such as the volunteer service board
5984127 also it gives us time as a collective group of student leaders just to hang out enjoy each others company throughout the entire weekend
5984128 i came here with a little bit of apprehension about how it was going to work as the summit has progressed its just been a really great opportunity to one get to know some of the other leaders of some of the other organizations and two to really get inside some of their brains and really understand what leadership and that kind of thing means to them
5984129 im glad that bsu has allowed us this opportunity to get to know fellow leaders inside of all of the organizations
5984130 it was a wonderful experience it was very challenging and rewarding at the same time i learned a lot about myself and about other people and also about the university and it was fun at the same time
5984131 its amazing how much work was put into it and it was really successful
5984132 all these things that i learned in the summit will be very helpful for me as a leader
5984133 what we wanted to give students was an opportunity to explore some of their values that are important to them and help them cultivate an understanding of some of the things that happen in leadership
5984134 i think the diversity training provided some of the students the venue the type of place where they could feel open to discussing some of the issues surrounding diversity
5984135 where they could discuss openly and freely without having to hold back any preformed opinions or judgments to where we could sit around and discuss some of these issues
5984136 the diversity training i had my own problems with that some things that i disagreed with the way that it was taught and the theories that were taught
5984137 the theory that we need to teach people is that everybody needs to be treated the same no matter what thats whats going to end hatred and racism
5984138 i would consider that the diversity training like nuts and bolts of how we can better ourselves as a big scheme to how we carry back onto bsu the mission the message
5984139 its hard its tough sometimes to look within yourself you know and say gosh how can i be a better person am i racist do i stereotype you know how can i change but thats the goal right
5984140 i thought it could have been done a lot better
5984141 last year they did a skit type of deal where they handed out different colors of cards and depending on what color of card you got that was your class rank like social class rank
5984142 one of the main things we talked about at summit was living in the moment and focusing on what you can control focus on the now
5984143 throughout the summit it was one of the key points and i think the movie really helped portray that
5984144 without the back door system we would have been more successful over the last 10 years
5984145 the system in place has definitely cost us a couple of all irelands
5984146 it is likely that you will have two teams in the final that came through the back door
5984147 i would like to see the back door system done away with altogether
5984148 the championship should be knock out there is a flaw in the system somewhere and it is somethnig the gaa has to look at
5984149 i would not want to rely on the bus system as it currently stands
5984150 the development in downtown boise and the rest of the treasure valley will continue to blossom
5984151 weve made efforts the last two years to convince legislation that this would benefit the public but discussions have not gone anywhere
5984152 republicans have had in place a rigid ideology that they dont want to be seen as supporting any taxes
5984153 its a waste of time because the process of the withdrawal of russian forces will continue
5984154 while it is great that children are given this financial start in life it is not fair that children born today will get 145 less after inflation than their predecessors in the course of the scheme we calculate babies born today should receive 288 to give them the same start in life
5984155 if youre ever asked one of your weaknesses give one of your strengths that if overdone could be a weakness
5984156 weve done all reasonable evaluation doing more will confirm what i already know fps will be minimal and the preliminary analysis that i have already done suggests this
5984157 tenemos una alegr a inmensa no podemos negarlo ya dimos el primer paso que es estar en la final adem s de darnos una revancha personal jugadores como yo como javier mascherano lionel messi o fernando gago tuvimos la desgracia de haber perdido una final de copa am rica hace un tiempo hoy ganamos y saldamos esa deuda

5984161 la verdad es que no quise meter un centro sino que busqu el arco por suerte le pegu mal y la pudo meter el kun

5984168 i have spent the past seven months burning up my cell phone going to meetings
5984169 its a real world mission instead of moving fake cargo
5984170 its training the army is spending the money anyway so we might as well do something good for the environment
5984171 i think if it was lowered to 18 that would still be reasonable because students understand theyre going to school not partying
5984172 i think president andersons aim in signing is that hes really emphasizing the fact that this is a discussion about the health of american college students that needs to happen
5984173 because that just makes younger students feel like oh maybe theres hope for me to be able to drink younger
5984174 i see kids that are underage drink all the time and its sad because its an epidemic basically
5984175 the university reserves the right to confiscate and dispose of alcoholic beverages and or containers found on the premises all students found in possession of alcoholic beverages on campus will be referred for campus disciplinary action
5984176 mckesson makes its own decisions about numbers of counsellors available at any point in time
5984177 meanwhile we have not received any complaints regarding counsellors not being available to take calls
5984178 and if its truncated and women dont get to say and hear everything they should that may not be helpful
5984179 i wouldnt argue with the need for such a service but if it isnt fulfilling its design we really need to re evaluate it
5984180 the story of stuff is a 20 minute fast paced fact filled look at the underside of our production and consumption patterns the story of stuff exposes the connections between a huge number of environmental and social issues and calls us together to create a more sustainable and just world itll teach you something itll make you laugh and it just may change the way you look at all the stuff in your life forever
5984181 it just means were starting to do things in the right way
5984182 were making less mistakes were starting to believe in what were doing it just validates the work that weve done its good but still theres a long ways to go its just nice to be there right now
5984183 i dont think weve played particularly bad in any of these games but tonight was one bad inning
5984184 we set the table for them and cracked it open further with an error and those guys capped it off with a hit we just didnt get it done late weve been doing a terrific job of that but not tonight
5984185 weve been pitching well its just at the end we cracked the door for them and let them win
5984186 its frustrating because we didnt play well enough certainly in the eighth inning theres not much more you can say about it
5984187 most of the afghan governmental institutions are dysfunctional and need serious reforms and capacity building before being able to operate efficiently

5984210 airlines could lose as much as us6 1 billion a7 0 billion this year
5984211 already some 25 airlines in our financial systems have gone bust greater than immediately following september 11 and we are bracing for more

5984225 c un clima che non mi piace si licenzia gente che guadagna 1500 euro al mese mentre manager che non hanno brillato nella gestione delle aziende tornano a casa ricoperti doro
5984226 non mi stancher mai di ribadirlo il sindacato non difende fannulloni e lavoratori scorretti che peraltro danneggiano prima di tutto i propri colleghi abbiamo ben chiaro qual il giusto equilibrio tra rivendicazione dei diritti e rispetto dei doveri cos come lesigenza di lasciarci alle spalle ogni esperienza di sindacato consociativo ma ora ci troviamo di fronte ad un clima esagerato come a voler scaricare sui lavoratori la responsabilit delle cose che non vanno nel paese e che nel caso delle fs sono una politica generale del trasporto sbagliata linefficienza dei servizi lassenza di trasferimenti da parte dello stato la minaccia della concorrenza
5984227 se stato alterato il rapporto tra ore lavorate e timbratura del cartellino si tratta di uninfrazione grave passibile di licenziamento se invece i lavoratori hanno solo chiesto ai colleghi di timbrare al posto loro il cartellino ma senza assentarsi dal lavoro allora si tratta di un caso che andrebbe affrontato con sanzioni meno pesanti
5984228 l qualcosa evidentemente non torna come dimostrano anche le reazioni degli schieramenti politici e degli osservatori imparziali come fanno cipolletta e moretti a parlare di lesione dellimmagine dellazienda quando i veri problemi sono altri che dire allora della pulizia dei treni e delle inefficienze del servizio come si fa a licenziare una persona che magari esagerando non fa altro che difendere gli interessi degli utenti e se poi accade un incidente che fine fa davvero limmagine dellazienda la linea adottata dai vertici delle fs inverte causa ed effetto ed controproducente anche se mi sembra dettata dalla voglia di spostare lattenzione dai problemi reali
5984229 guardi le fs sono passate nel giro di pochi anni da 200mila a meno di 100mila dipendenti e stata la pi grande ristrutturazione aziendale nella storia del paese ed stata fatta con il consenso del sindacato se ora lesigenza quella di diffondere il pi possibile la cultura del dovere mi chiedo perch non si cerchi un rapporto positivo con i sindacati piuttosto che risolvere il tutto sul fronte degli attacchi individuali
5984230 gi ho detto come la penso sul ruolo del sindacato nella lotta ai fannulloni e alle irregolarit daltro canto nella pubblica amministrazione i licenziamenti di lavoratori per giusta causa ci sono sempre stati senza che nel paese si scatenassero particolari dibattiti ma ora esiste un clima generale alimentato da anni di campagna ideologica contro la pubblica amministrazione motivata in fondo dagli interessi di chi vuole mettere in discussione i servizi pubblici a partire dalla sanit e dalla scuola
5984231 non abbiamo chiuso gli occhi e evidente che esistono sacche di inefficienza e forti esigenze di modernizzazione ma mi sembra che brunetta abbia lisciato il pelo a questo comune sentire usando per strumenti indifferenziati che penalizzano anche chi ha sempre fatto il proprio dovere cio la stragrande maggioranza dei lavoratori ci sono dipendenti pubblici che negli ultimi anni non hanno mai fatto un giorno di assenza per malattia e che se lo fanno ora si vedono decurtare lo stipendio
5984232 e vero lesecutivo tende a minimizzare ma sar un autunno difficile dopo la pubblicazione dei pessimi dati sul pil nella ue molti governi europei hanno interrotto le ferie per riunioni durgenza sulle contromisure da adottare di fronte alla crisi il nostro invece non ha dato segni di vita davanti ai venti di recessione dimostra che lunica cosa che gli sta a cuore il federalismo mi dispiace anche per lenfasi dimostrata dal ministro sacconi per i dati sullaumento delle ore di straordinario determinato dalla defiscalizzazione in realt il vero problema lo spaventoso incremento delle ore di cassa integrazione nelle aziende il fatto che le misure del governo nel breve periodo hanno effetti depressivi perch non sostengono i redditi e gli investimenti oltre a tagliare fondi per settori chiave come la ricerca e linnovazione

5984248 we met at the university guest house and discussed the offer from management we agreed to convene the assembly on thursday tomorrow
5984249 it will be upon the assembly to decide whether we strike next week or not but still the university council has to address our issues comprehensively
5984250 we need to educate our children very well in order for them to become responsible citizens of the country

5984254 no recuerdo una brasil que haya jugado tan mal como la de ayer
5984255 there is nothing that can stop the government from taxing 100 of income so long as the people get benefits from the government commensurate with their income which is taxed
5984256 i do not see why the government cannot tax those who have more and syphon some of these revenues into savings which can be utilized in investment for future development
5984257 certainly there is no limit to taxation if the benefits derived from public services by society measure up to the cost in taxation which they have to pay
5984258 it is a fallacy to say that there is this limit and it is a fallacy to rely mainly on individual free enterprise to get the savings
5984259 tax laws that restore some balance to the distribution of the nations wealth
5984260 we can only compete if our government makes the investments that give us a fighting chance
5984261 and if we know that our families have some net beneath which they cannot fall
5984262 if left to the individual consolidation will take a long time to come we have to look at priorities in terms of what is good for society and on this basis
5984263 the government should restrict the size of farms that can be owned by one individual throughout the country
5984264 one who has read marx cannot fail to see that corporations are not only what marx referred to as the advanced stage of capitalism
5984265 but marx even called it finance capitalism by which a few would control the finances of so many and through this have not only economic power but political power as well
5984266 we hold them up as role models and our mythology is steeped in stories of men on the make
5984267 the problems of poverty and racism the uninsured and the unemployed are rooted in the desire among those at the top of the social ladder to maintain their wealth and status whatever the cost

5984275 ive had a fantastic season at lancashire and have thoroughly enjoyed everything about my first year at the club
5984276 when i originally signed my focus was to continue to develop as a cricketer and to make an impact when given an opportunity
5984277 i love the club and am excited about the prospect of playing here for at least the next three seasons
5984278 if we are going for the title in our last game i will definitely play in it
5984279 but if we are not pushing for first spot i will probably go back earlier
5984280 what we hope to offer is greater capacity in order to serve more users rather than just focusing on the top speeds

5984306 we try to turn over the suspects to police in 15 to 20 minutes
5984307 i have to tend to my business and have no time to drive them away
5984308 police did not come to help because it was too small a case but my customers might be stopped from coming in
5984309 its unacceptable when citizens feel they have to turn to private police who are not accountable to the public under the police act not subject to standards of discipline and rules of professional conduct and over which there is no civilian oversight
5984310 if you use the description a gym people in north america get a totally different concept of what it is were speaking about

5984318 so i think obviously were going to have to judge how the parliamentary agenda is unfolding i think weve had a productive 2 1 2 years i think that has slowed somewhat in recent weeks

5984324 i kind of like being the underdog no pressure i knew what i expected of myself knew what i had done in practice and to go out there today and finish the way i finished was just so exciting
5984325 france is committed to pursuing the struggle against terrorism for democracy and for freedom this is a just cause it is an honour for france and for its army to defend it

5984327 the open court rule which is extremely historically important has now become distorted by the effect of massive search engines

5984344 the safety of our crews is paramount so we withdrew for about 10 minutes until the threat of fireworks and some cylinders in the shed was over
5984345 when we re started operations the firefighters worked extremely hard to make sure this potentially dangerous incident was under control very quickly and they prevented it from spreading to a nearby corn field

5984355 firstly zulkiflis conduct is not an issue that involves pakatan so much as pkr
5984356 after that we tried to get in touch with zulkifli but he remained incommunicado
5984357 then preparations for the permatang pauh by election supervened and urgency on the matter receded but it was not shelved
5984358 as far as the partys disciplinary process is concerned the matter is in abeyance rather than resolved
5984359 you must remember the hierarchy in pkr leave alone pakatan does not wield a single set of vocal chords with the rest of the party in the role of chorus boys
5984360 there is a healthy diversity of viewpoints but on matters of grave public interest and with respect to the public deportment of party members and leaders there must be uniformity and decorum otherwise you are not a political party but a cacophony that we are not
5984361 umnos hegemony rather than the willing adherence of its components
5984362 the components adhere by dint of the hegemons coercive authority not by willing subscription to its ideology or platform
5984363 by contrast pakatans cohesion is the fruit of broad concord among its constituents on the need for change to malaysian political culture
5984364 but these cannot obscure the broad harmony on overarching themes and aims

5984377 we face as a country economic challenges some of these we face in common with the western world
5984378 we also face a situation where our determination over macroeconomic policy is extremely limited nonetheless i think its right and proper that the commits itself to focus on efforts towards a single overarching purpose of increasing sustainable economic growth in scotland
5984379 more than that i want to restate a basic contention of the government that there is every reason to be confident in the future of the scottish economy our workforce and businesses and this countrys ability to define and seize new economic opportunities
5984380 other people right now see scotland not as backmarkers but as frontrunners
5984381 the old lobbying culture is giving way in my opinion to a more open flexible democratic chamber based on multiple coalitions of ideas and aspirations
5984382 in short across the whole of society scotland is moving forward whatever the short term smoke of difficulties in the economy
5984383 we welcome the new confident nation we are proud to serve it thanks to the work of the democratic pioneers such as donald dewar whatever the constitutional configuration of our country we can stand the opportunity to be one of the true successes of the 21st century
5984384 in central fife i can promise you the snp will be practising hard and will be taking nothing for granted and we will be working as hard if not harder than we worked in glasgow east

5984390 this is part of the tough tactics used to intimidate and silence protesters
5984391 of course its of concern that china will use a system thats clearly beyond the pale in terms of international standards in terms of arbitrary deprivation of freedoms and liberties to do that
5984392 we have no records of these two names in our system
5984393 it is better to deal with the government than make it your enemy

5984456 oh yes so i couldnt work as i usually did during my trips to buenos aires time had stopped for me she didnt call me at any time for these three days i was very restless because i didnt know how to communicate with her i didnt have the hotels telephone number i thought that i would never see her again after those three days maria called me and we planned to get together that night we went to an italian restaurant it was beautiful place we had dinner and talked about ours lives it was a wonderful night
5984457 can you please not see me tomorrow i would like to be by myself i want to think about it
5984458 yes but please think with your heart then i said good bye and left i returned to the coffee shop on the day that i was supposed to but when i got there i didnt see her then i asked another waitress about ms maria and she said that maria no longer worked there she had left the job earlier on that same day i was desperate because i didnt have marias address i made an attempt to get her address from her coworkers but it was in vain no one would give that to me i sat on a chair for a minute to think of what i should do because i was feeling very unhappy after a while i left the coffee shop but when i crossed the street i saw my angel waiting for me i couldnt believe on my eyes so i looked twice to make sure that it was her maria was smiling at me and said that she had decided to go with me she also said that she believed that i was a good man and would make her happy my heart began to beat very fast and i thought that i was going to have a heart attack i was so excited and the only thing i wanted to do was to hug her and not let her go for any reason
5984459 i asked her if i could meet her parents maria said that her father died when she was twenty years old and she had to leave school to take care of her mother unfortunately her mother died five years after her fathers death marias mother was very unhappy without her father maria said that her mother wanted to die to be with her father after her mothers death she had to take care of herself and she told me that life had been very hard to her then i asked her to not talk about sadness and i promised her that only happiness would be part of her life from now on

5984489 sometimes you just have to admit that you didnt do your homework as well as you might have thought
5984490 this is really good news it was more than i expected
5984491 at that time the national park service had a somewhat different philosophy about where to place visitors centers it was to put them as close as possible to historic resources
5984492 had the expansion gone forward that would be the issue it would be a bigger blemish
5984493 the whole time we were writing it we were trying to picture ryan and the feelings of him and his family

5984495 im just trying to make sense of the terrible grief that my family feels and turn it into something positive
5984496 the sentiment speaks volumes lost heroes every man and woman that weve lost in iraq and afghanistan are just that lost heroes
5984497 it will spread awareness to everyone else that doesnt know that much about the charity
5984498 id like maybe to send a copy or two to the troops in iraq or afghanistan just so they know what were doing
5984499 ako ay sanay na rin diyan kasi sinigawan na rin ako paminsan minsan im used to that sometimes she also shouts at me i think it is normal for the president to act that way ive seen her flare up like that
5984500 kasi frustrated ang pangulo alam mo ang pangulo action lady gusto niya magawa kaagad the president is frustrated you know her she is an action lady she wanted everything to be done at once
5984501 talagang magagalit yun pag hindi handa ang kanyang staff she really flares up when her staff is unprepared they should be more forgiving
5984502 tantrums will not do any good in these situations a good leader is one who maintains his or her composure stability under pressure all these things are good traits of a good leader

5984506 but even though were still fighting a hard battle and we still have a deficit were really really really in a lot better shape than we were three years ago were turning the corner
5984507 there remains however a perception that the festival has been slow to pick up on a burgeoning freak folk scene that would be a natural fit with its jericho beach park location
5984508 im quite surprised that we havent had anyone like sufjan stevens or devendra banhart or will oldham or animal collective
5984509 perhaps those people are a little more expensive i do appreciate the non star system that our festival has always had but i do think theres a lot going on in the new songwriters scene that would be really great in a big park with all those lovely people

5984531 theres always that frustration of not winning the championship youll have to carry that label
5984532 my father carried it for a long time texas coach mack brown carried for a long time ill have to carry it
5984533 i think until you win a championship thats always going to be the analogy and accurately so
5984534 but its amazing how much one more year in the weight room can do one more year on the field
5984535 i think this teams not selfish so i think were going to be fine
5984536 were happy with where were at but were not satisfied
5984537 were in a great position but we cant look ahead
5984538 its been very difficult to watch him struggle with his back
5984539 i think its a surprise to so many people because david first of all never complains to anyone
5984540 he never complained to the girls about his back i can tell you that in 2005 when he had back surgery the doctor said he had never done a bigger surgery on anyones back
5984541 i think the magnitude of it no everyone knows and thats the way david is but it was evident to me and my daughters the wear was difficult on him with the recruiting
5984542 some of these kids on our team they just got on campus
5984543 it was sad for me because david is young and is having the pain that hes having
5984544 at the same time im honored to be the one who gets to be mentored by of the best coaches in the country
5984545 how many people in their life get to do something that they absolutely love
5984546 hes the calming influence which well still have hes the technical side of it
5984547 my father never really pushed me to go here but it was still where i wanted to go
5984548 hes been second team in the secondary all through spring and also in the fall hes made a big impact on special teams he was on the kickoff coverage team and the punt return team he works hard every day
5984549 if a walk on needs an example on how to earn a scholarship tyrone is a good example
5984550 i want to play in the secondary but i will do whatever i can to help
5984551 thats actually not the no 1 question i get from people
5984552 the no 1 question is how is saban but the next question is usually about julio hes doing good hes a contender
5984553 this is a message to all players who want to walk on
5984554 we are happy and pleased that we were able to reward these guys for their efforts
5984555 that stage is over with he doesnt have a choice hes been here since june his freshman period is over with its time to play ball
5984556 were just trying to get the best people on the field and if that means moving people around thats part of it
5984557 probably when were in base ill be sticking with the sam right now thats what we have but when we go into nickel and dime situation we can move people around and put people in different spots
5984558 for the base stuff unless someone goes down which hopefully wont happen ill probably be sticking at sam
5984559 it worked out well in the scrimmage saturday he played well there there was a lot of carryover for him
5984560 were a little short at inside backer in terms of depth but i think we have to play our 11 best players and if he has to double up somewhere inside then thats what he has to do
5984561 he knows what hes doing which is hard to do for freshmen to come in and learn the playbook hes one of the ones whos really stepped up and known what to do it also helps when you have rolando mcclain sitting right next to you
5984562 obviously he was a great linebacker in high school because the instinct comes to him naturally
5984563 playing the most significant roles of any guys who walked on to our team
5984564 i thought we were more aggressive we played more physical on both sides of the ball played with more toughness
5984565 obviously well take about the next month and see how he develops and that will be critical for what we decide to do with him down the road but we want him to be a part of our team and we want him to be part of our rotation at receiver

5984597 bad captaincy by dhoni to have allowed seventh wicket partership of 70 and to have given bowlers like yuvraj at 44 for 6 he should wrapped up the innings below 100 by using main bowlers and not part timers though as much as i like dhoni i believe the media and analysts overlook his mistakes

5984842 one of the ways states experiment is not only being more protective but being more protective more cheaply they win if they figure out a way to make environmental controls less costly
5984843 the idea was to make this information accessible to public and to state governments

5984846 three out of four ohioans dont know enough about either of these guys to form an opinion
5984847 cordray has an advantage because hes been elected statewide so he has better name id but theres a long way to go and neither man has made an impression on ohio voters
5984848 weve mounted a true statewide campaign with coordinators in all 88 counties with an aggressive outreach plan
5984849 how do you think somebody who hasnt been in the public eye for 15 years and has never been on a statewide ballot is going to develop name id

5984860 poenget mitt er at l gnene om gulag demoniserer sovjet og stalin demonisering fungerer fordummende uansett hvem den rammer videre mener jeg at den spesifikke demoniseringen av sovjet og stalin i stor grad er antikommunistisk motivert og at den fors ker avvise de enorme konomiske og sosiale fremskrittene i sovjet fra 1922 til 1940 samt etter krigen

5984894 hopefully that will get premier mcguinty even more excited about the pan am games
5984895 id say we have a pretty good chance of beating the 12 medals we won in athens
5984896 i said i believed in our programs and our kids and i do we did have a late start but we knew we had a lot of good things coming up
5984897 that was the toughest part to stay calm and stay positive believing in myself and believing i would be able perform today and i did
5984898 he was up there in the high 80s low 90s on every single dive and we havent seen that out of him probably ever
5984899 training is just training but mentally it was very hard you know for me to stay positive believing that i would be able to pull this off believing that i was going to be able to come and put six dives together and perform
5984900 that was the hardest part because there were days when i felt like a beginner there were days at the beginning where all my reflexes were gone everything was gone
5984901 before the event we saw that he was in the zone i dont know where he gets it from if we could bottle it damn we would
5984902 it is extremely hard to come here in china and compete against them they are so strong everywhere in the world and to be home just makes them stronger
5984903 qin kai was the world champion coming in here and i finished in front of him today
5984904 its unbelievable weve played really well and its a little frustrating losing four one run ball games especially four in a row
5984905 the whole time today everyone was just yelling at me sing like kreek
5984906 watching simon win in 2000 was one of those moments that i just kind of realized that i want to be a canadian athlete and i want to be an olympic champion and i want to race at a world class level
5984907 those guys you cant help but be inspired by them
5984908 i think canadian sport just needs to latch on to those guys and really take the attitude they have what they did was amazing

5984911 i think the home crowd advantage gave the chinese lad a bit of a boost
5984912 that was enough to put jason into second place to me he did the best routine today
5984913 they were shaking my hand and saying that my boy was no 1
5984914 they might have been judging a little harder across the board
5984915 going up early may have been better for pressure but its not better for judges expectations
5984916 i knew i wasnt quite safe but i was happy overall
5984917 i just love that part watching the scores pop up and seeing if theyre higher or lower than me
5984918 the race went by so quick its just a blur when they said photo finish on the scoreboard im looking up and its like oh my gosh whats the result it felt like forever
5984919 when i finally saw my name and then i saw sallys we just ran at each other and jumped because were the underdogs nobody expected anything out of all three of us and for us to go out there and place 1 2 3 proves to the world that we are here and we are competitors its such an exciting feeling
5984920 i kind of like being the underdog no pressure i knew what i expected of myself knew what i had done in practice and to go out there today and finish the way i finished was just so exciting
5984921 but i think at that level even if you wrestle with your brother you dont want to lose because everybody has the same goal
5984922 four minutes six minutes or a few seconds youre training the whole year for it youre dreaming for it you go there its just you its just you and thats it
5984923 i know it was 1 0 but sometimes its really hard to get one point
5984924 i try to do the best so i dont have to go and fix it back again
5984925 coming in we knew wed be behind the ball with these guys to get some points early was a good thing but maybe we got a little excited about it and paid for it in the end
5984926 its tough to race at this level when a lot of these guys are doing 15 or 20 races a year while the canadians have done three at the end of the day these guys are just really good its the frigging olympics right
5984927 its getting better every year but were left to our own devices to make things happen
5984928 im just going to run my heart out and hope for the best
5984929 im just trying to get through to the next round
5984930 the rivalry has always been there theyve always been strong so its nothing new

5984933 ive been practising the lean its great to see all the training came together all the hard work
5984934 i just thought about god who blessed me with this talent my family my coach anthony mccleary my husband bronsen schliep everybody emotion just took over me
5984935 about hurdle six or seven she started making her move because she was a little behind she really put it on ive seen her do that many times before
5984936 but i just started screaming because it was so close then it started flashing photo finish photo finish it seemed like it went on for 10 days then i just went ecstatic
5984937 an amazing worker she just goes and goes and goes im so proud of her i cant tell you
5984938 from the day i met her i couldnt get rid of her
5984939 she wouldnt leave she said i want to be at your track and i want you to coach me that was it
5984940 athens was a huge experience for me my first big meet
5984941 there were so many people in the stands i didnt know what to think and i got so thrown off
5984942 thats not what im about my job was to get him a medal and it worked
5984943 it was my dream to make the team and just to come here and experience it and provide a little help is a thrill to see simon get a medal for the country is a great thrill for me
5984944 he came out to victoria he worked so hard and the day after world championships we went riding the next day together and i said now the job begins
5984945 he was the definition of execution today he did exactly what he needed to do
5984946 people think triathlon is an individual sport but its not

5984949 theres no reason that hes just going to slow down
5984950 i dont know what to say i cant believe im back here at canada house with a medal
5984951 i had to reconvince myself that wed done enough heat training
5984952 i was thinking man am i fading in the heat or whats going on
5984953 what im most concerned about though are the glasses im afraid that the game might not make it to the event given that it will require two extra sets of glasses in addition to the red cyan ones for people to see the game
5984954 when i was a kid i remember they were winning all the stanley cups and every kid on the street had a habs jersey
5984955 and what i remember the most was the rocket richard book that we used to read at school
5984956 its still surreal i live here in edmonton and i havent lived in montreal in a long time and i havent really gone back there in the summer
5984957 i think its going to hit home when i get there when training camp starts and i get to wear the jersey for the first time i dont think its totally sunk in yet
5984958 the fact that i live here it would have been much easier to play here but it was a hard decision to make it was really tough
5984959 my dad lives in edmonton my mom lives in montreal my mom was begging me to come back home
5984960 i love it here if it wasnt for the fact that my mom was there i would have stayed here
5984961 living in montreal for a full year is something that i havent done for a while

5984990 in terms of preparing them for the world we need to redefine our attitudes towards traditional ideas of cheating
5984991 unless the students have a conceptual understanding of the topic or what they are working on they cant access bits and pieces of information to support them in a task effectively
5984992 in their working lives they will never need to carry enormous amounts of information around in their heads what they will need to do is access information from all their sources quickly and they will need to check the reliability of their information
5984993 what if we allowed the use of mobile phones and instant messaging to collect information during exams redefining such activity from cheating to using our tools and including the world in our knowledge base

5985011 the university of aberdeens annual open day provides prospective students with the opportunity to discover all that the university has to offer
5985012 selecting the university which you are going to attend can be an extremely daunting prospect with a multitude of decisions and an array of choices facing new students offering free hugs at the event is just one of the ways in which we will be making visitors feel welcome its hoped that a reassuring embrace from a friendly face will alleviate fears and set a relaxed and fun tone for the day
5985013 the open day provides the ideal opportunity to showcase the fact that the university of aberdeen is a friendly and spirited place with a wealth of activities and facilities for students
5985014 the free hugs aspect of the occasion is designed to engage visitors with the university from the moment they step onto campus and make them truly feel part of the event it is hoped that attendees will feel encouraged to see if they have made it to the final cut of the free hugs film which will produced and screened at the inaugural freshers week film festival

5985160 en aquel momento solo sent que hab a hecho realidad una idea del comandante cumpl a una misi n y nada m s como hacemos todos los cubanos
5985161 solo durante la realizaci n del primer congreso mundial de alfabetizaci n un encuentro de los educadores que trabajamos en bien de la humanidad comenc a comprender la real magnitud pol tica de la tarea la idea verdadera de fidel que no es solo alfabetizar sino vindicar a los excluidos de la tierra lograr un movimiento social que los una como seres humanos transformar el mundo en ese congreso casi me sorprendo aunque nunca averiguo cu ntos alfabetizados ya hay por el m todo yo s puedo ni por cu ntos pa ses anda no pregunto para evitar el susto
5985162 soy la misma mujer sencilla de siempre que hace cola atiende su casa sigo igual aunque internamente me siento ahora m s humana que antes lo alcanzado hasta aqu me ha permitido trazarme un objetivo en la vida seguir contribuyendo desde cualquier trinchera a eliminar el analfabetismo esa es la injusticia social m s grande que he visto en la vida porque cada analfabeto est asociado al hambre a la miseria al desempleo a condiciones infrahumanas y cuando t le das una cartilla y un l piz esa persona te besa y te abraza como si le hubieras dado lo m s grande del mundo entonces como es tanto el amor que he recibido creo que tengo que seguir pagando as con amor
5985163 con su mano sobre mi hombro y t sabes cu nto pesa esa mano es algo muy grande ya sinti ndome por dentro el compromiso que aquello significaba me dio varias sugerencias pensando en el uso de la televisi n para alfabetizar hacer una cartilla de cuatro o cinco p ginas y para elaborarla combinar los n meros con las letras y empezar por la palabra casa
5985164 aun sin partir de ning n supuesto pedag gico o cient fico l sab a que las personas iletradas conoc an los n meros y ese fue el argumento la palabra casa deb a ser la primera explic porque se pod a traducir f cilmente a otros idiomas y porque de alguna forma tambi n el analfabeto conoce lo que es si no la tiene sabe cu n necesaria resulta y si la tiene lucha much simo por mantenerla
5985165 porque imag nate t combinar los n meros con las letras es realmente algo dif cil ya hab amos hecho una cartilla muy amplia para la radio y aunque l no lo expres cuando conversamos sent que no le satisfac a porque era demasiado amplia al sugerirme una de pocas p ginas yo estaba percibiendo una cr tica muy sutil muy delicada pero una cr tica
5985166 organic entonces los n meros de acuerdo con la frecuencia de uso de cada una de esas consonantes y a las vocales en el mismo orden que se conocen les otorgu del uno al cinco
5985167 hubiera sido f cil adoptar el m todo para ense ar la lectoescritura en la primaria donde tambi n hay un orden para el aprendizaje
5985168 despu s de numerar del uno al cinco a las vocales la primera consonante que aprender an asociada al n mero seis decid que ser a la l de trazo f cil para aquellos que nunca han tomado un l piz y entre sus manos torpes de tanto trabajo rudo les parece un instrumento demasiado fr gil y a la vez impresionante

5985176 we were looking for a way to get people to change their behavior

5985179 we know that eating more fruits and vegetables combined with 60 minutes of moderate activity we dont use the e word can reduce risk of heart disease stroke diabetes

5985218 our citizens and our government must recognize the importance of pillar industries such as the automotive industry for national strength technological expertise and economic vitality now and for future generations the automotive industry is critical to jobs in the united states north america and influences worldwide economies for every job created in the auto industry nine more are created to support it if our government invested 20 40 billion in the u s automotive industry today alternative energy for vehicles would increase dramatically and dependence on foreign oil would drastically diminish we need a distribution network for these energy alternatives and it is incumbent on the federal government to help fund and accelerate this network i believe the statistic is 49 000 fueling stations converted to accommodate alternative fueling systems such as hydrogen would supply over 80 of our needs punitive measures are not the only catalyst to increased fuel efficiency goals and diminished greenhouse gases incentives and investment will spur growth in innovative technologies much faster than avoidance of fines and special taxes

5985331 amr ibnul jamuh membiarkan kedermawanannya merajalela dan memanng wajar bila ia dibiarkan berkuasa jika datang permintaan dilepasnya kendali hartanya silakan ambil ujarnya karena esok ia akan kembali berlipatganda
5985332 ya rasulallah putra putraku bermaksud hendak menghalangiku pergi bertempur bersama anda demi allab aku amat berharap kiranya dengan kepincanganku ini aku dapat merebut surga
5985333 ya allah berilah aku kesempatan untuk menemui syahid dan janganlah aku dikembalikan kepada keluargaku

5985340 sesungguhnya allah tidah suka pada setiap orang yang congkak dan sombong
5985341 ya rasulallah aku senang kepada pakaian yang indah dan kasut yang bagus dan sungguh aku takut dengan ini akan menjadi orang yang congkak dan sombong

5985350 punishing wu and wang after they applied for protest permits and actively petitioned the government demonstrates that the official statements touting the new olympics protest zones as well as the permit application process were no more than a show
5985351 the record speaks for itself in addition to retaliatory actions despite numerous applications made no approvals for demonstrations have been reported

5985354 the glue that was holding the coalition partners together was mr musharraf now that punching bag has gone
5985355 the only thing thats a surprise is how quickly it has happened after musharraf left theyve hardly had time to savor their victory
5985356 the coalition may not continue if the judges are not restored
5985357 if elections are held i dont think the peoples party can survive it will be wiped out
5985358 if they dont settle it then we could review our strategy and relations with the government all options will be open

5985362 waktu yang empat tahun itu tak ubahnya bagai suatu usia manusia yang panjang lebar penuh dengan segala yang baik dari perkataan sampai kepada perbuatan dan pendengaran
5985363 tuan tuan telah mengatakan bahwa abu hurairah banyak sekali mengeluarkan hadits dari nabi saw
5985364 siapa yang membentangkan sorbannya hingga selesai pembicraanku kemudian ia meraihnya ke dirinya maka ia takkan terlupa akan suatu pun dari apa yang telah didengarya dari padaku
5985365 sesungguhnya orang orang yang menyembunyikan apa apa yang telah kami turunkan berupa keterangan keterangan dan petunjuk sesudah kami nyatakan kepada manusia di dalam kitab mereka itulah yang dikutuk oleh allah dan dikutuk oleh para pengutuk malaikat malaikat
5985366 hendaklah kamu hentikan menyampaikan berita dari rasulullah bila tidak maka akan kukembalikan kau ke tanah daus
5985367 sibukkanlah dirimu dengan al quran karena dia adalah kalam allah
5985368 kurangilah olehmu meriwayatkan perihal rasulullah kecuali yang mengenai amal perbuatannya
5985369 tak ada seorang pun dari sahabat sahabat rasul yang lebih banyak menghafal hadits dari padaku kecuali abdullah bin amr bin ash karena ia pandai menuliskannya sedang aku tidak
5985370 la seorang yang paling banyak hafal di antara seluruh perawi hadits sesamanya
5985371 dengan demikian tak ada satu saat pun yang berlalu setiap malam di rumah abu hurairah melainkan berlangsung di sana ibadat dzikir dan shalat

5985381 shabar wahai keluarga yasir tempat yang telah dijanjikan bagi kalian adalah surga
5985382 kamu berani meninggalkan agama nenek moyangmu padahal mereka lebih baik daripadamu akan kami uji sampai di mana ketabahanmu akan kami jatuhkan kehormatanmu akan kami rusak perniagaanmu dan akan kami musnahkan harta bendamu
5985383 orang rang musyrik membakar ammar bin yasir dengan api maka rasulullah saw lewat di tempatnya lain memegang kepalanya dengan tangan beliau sambil bersabda

5985385 bangunlah hai pahlawan tak ada sesalan atasmu dan tak ada cacat
5985386 orang orang hafir itu telah menyiksamu dan menenggelamkanmu ke dalam air sampai kamu mengucapkan begini dan begitu
5985387 jika mereka memaksaimu lagi tidak apa ucapkanlah seperti apa yang kamu katakan tadi
5985388 siapa yang memusuhi ammar maka ia akan dimusuhi allah dan siapa yang membenci ammar maka ia akan dibenci allah
5985389 orang yang memakmurkan mesjid nilainya tidak sama sibuk bekerja sambil duduk di sini berdiri di sana sedang pemalas lari menghindar tertidur di sana
5985390 apa mahsud mereka terhadap ammar diserunya mereka ke surga tapi mereka hendak mengajaknya ke neraha sungguh ammar adalah biji matahu sendiri
5985391 contoh dan ikutilah setelah kematianku nanti abu bakar dan umar dan ambillah pula hidayah yang dipakai ammar untuk jadi bimbingan
5985392 saya kirim kepada tuan tuan ammar bin yasir sebagai amir dan ibnu masud sebagai bendahara dan wazir kedua mereka adalah orang orang pilihan dari golongan shahabat muhammad saw dan termasuk pahlawan pahlawan badar
5985393 saya lihat ammar bin yasir sewaktu menjadi amir di kufah membeli sayuran di pasar lain mengikatnya dengan tail dan memikulnya di atas punggung dan membawanya pulang
5985394 hai kaum muslimin apakah tuan tuan hendak lari dari surga inilah saya ammar bin yasir kemarilah tuan tuan
5985395 siapakah yang akan mampu mengemukakan teladan dan contoh luhur ini kalau bukan seorang rasul mulia dan maha guru utama
5985396 siapakah yang harus kami ikuti menurutmu jika terjadi pertikaian di antara ummat
5985397 ikutilah oleh kalian ibnu sumayyah kauena sampai matinya ia tak hendak berpisah dengan kebenaran
5985398 andainya kita duduk duduk berpangku tangan sedang nabi sibuk bekerja tak pernah diam maka perbuatan kita adalah perbuatan sesat lagi menyesatkan
5985399 ya allah hidup bahagia adalah hidup di akhirat berilah rahmat kaum anshar dan kaum muhajirat
5985400 apakah akan sama nilainya orang yang bekerja membina masjid sibuk bekerja baik berdiri maupun duduk dengan yang menyingkir berpangku tangan
5985401 tidak ammar tidak apa apa hanya nanti ia akan dibunuh oleh golongan pendurhaha
5985402 siapa yang menyerukan marilah shalat saya penuhi dan siapa yang mengatakan marilah mencapai bahagia sayaturuti tetapi yang mengatakan marilah bunuh saudaramu yang muslimin dan marilah rampas harta bendanya maka saya jawab tidlak
5985403 dan ambillah olehmu petunjuk yang dipakai oleh ammar sebagai bimbingan
5985404 barangsiapa yang memusuhi ammar maka ia akan dimusuhi oleh allah
5985405 selamat datang bagi orang baik dan diterima baik idzinkanlah ia masuk
5985406 aku berlindung kepada allah dari fitnah aku berlindung kepada allah dari fitnah
5985407 hai ummat manusia marilah kita berangkat menuju gerombolan yang mengaku ngaku hndak menuntutkan bela utsman demi allah maksud mereka bukanlah hendak menuntutkan belanya itu tetapi sebenarnya mereka telah merasakan manisnya dunia dan telah ketagihan terhadapnya dan mereka mengetahui bahwa kebenaran itu menjadi penghalang bagi pelampiasan nafsu serakah mereka mereka bukan yang berlomba dan tidak termasuk barisan pendahulu memeluk agama islam argumentasi apa sehingga mereka merasa berhak untuk ditaati oleh kaum muslimin dan diangkat sebagai pemimpin dan tidak pula dijumpai dalam hati mereka perasaan takut kepada allah yang akan mendorong mereka untuk mengikuti kebenaran mereka telah menipu orang banyak dengan mengakui hendak menuntutkan bela kematian utsman padahal tujuan mereka yang sesungguhnya ialah hendak menjadi raja dan penguasa adikara
5985408 demi dzat yang menguasai nyawaku saya telah bertempur dengan mengibarkan bendera ini bersama rasulullah saw dan inilah aku siap berperang pula dengan mengibarkannya sekarang ini demi nyawa saya berada dalam tangan nya seandainya mereka menggempur dan menyerbu hingga berhasil mencapai kubu pertahanan kita saya tahu pasti bahwa kita berada di pihak yang haq dan bahwa mereka di pihak yang bathil
5985409 kami ikut serta dengan ali r a di pertempuran shiffin maka saya lihat ammar bin yasir r a setiap ia menyerbu ke sesuatu jurusan atau turun ke sesuatu lembah para shahabat rasulullah pun mengikutinya tak ubahnya ia bagai panji panji bagi mereka
5985410 hari ini daku akan berjumpa dengan para kekasih tercinta muhammad dan para shahabatnya

5985413 hari ini aku akan berjumpa dengan para kekasih tercinta dengan muhammad saw dan para shahabatnya

5985458 we noted that a significant number of claimants would be asked to complete a form and we considered that because the ad stated that claimants could make a claim without having to fill out any forms the ad was misleading
5985459 we are not closing doors but we cannot continue with business as usual as long as russia does not commit to the principles upon which we agreed to base our relationship
5985460 russia is very clearly isolating itself its becoming more and more the outlaw in this conflict it is clearly in violation of a ceasefire agreement that it signed signed willingly its forces are behaving in a wholly inappropriate fashion in a neighbouring state its been called to account by nato called to account by the european union and i think this is going to continue
5985461 it appears to me that nato is trying to portray the aggressor as the victim to whitewash a criminal regime and to save a failing regime
5985462 the russian leadership is in a strong enough position domestically it did not need a little victorious war russia was dragged into the fray by the recklessness of the georgian president mikheil saakashvili he would not have dared to attack without outside support once he did russia could not afford inaction
5985463 nato has little it can do and little it should do we dont want to escalate this into an international conflict the process of engagement between the two parties that is emerging is what needs to be pushed
5985464 regardless of the citys claims were going to be having free housing here in the park
5985465 we are going to be having free housing here in the park we will stay past the curfew we will enjoy each others company
5985466 we will be putting up a tent city here thats going to include space for homeless people too
5985467 its going to bring more attention and get the message out and make it stronger to the delegates and the public immediately end the war sixteen months is too long were going to hold the democratic party and every other elected official accountable
5985468 which buy all of the top players in the market
5985469 difficult for fans to feel identified with their club and players
5985470 currently in football we see a monopolisation of resources and wealth by some clubs which dominate all competitions directly influencing the predictability of the sports results

5985477 i havent changed my mind i want to join everton

5985480 i have spoken to yak vaughany and lukas and i saw some highlights on evertontv
5985481 the guys did really well against blackburn and we were unlucky to concede at such a late stage in the game
5985482 its just nice to see the younger boys get a taste of being around the first team
5985483 it is a dream come true to reach the final of the olympic games

5985489 i want atheism to be true it isnt just that i dont believe in god and naturally hope that im right in my belief its that i hope there is no god i dont want there to be a god i dont want the universe to be like that i am curious whether there is anyone who is genuinely indifferent as to whether there is a god anyone who whatever his actual belief about the batter doesnt particularly want ether one of the answers to be correct
5985490 if you dont trust the bible enough to let it challenge and correct your thinking how could you ever have a personal relationship with god in any truly personal relationship the other person has to be able to contradict you if a wife is not allowed to contradict her husband they wont have an intimate relationship now what happens if you eliminate anything from the bible that offends your sensibility and crosses your will if you pick and choose what you want to believe and reject the rest how will you ever have a god who can contradict you you wont youll have a stepford god a god essentially of your own making and not a god with whom you can have a relationship and genuine interaction only if your god can say things that outrage you and make you struggle as in a real friendship or marriage will you know that you have gotten hold of a real god and not a figment of your imagination so an authoritative bible is not the enemy of a personal relationship with god it is the precondition for it

5985524 de acuerdo con estad sticas del insssep en el chaco hay un problema importante porque m s del 50 por ciento de las personas tienen entre sobrepeso y obesidad los hombres con m s de 100 cent metros y las mujeres con m s de 88 cent metros tienen obesidad abdominal
5985525 existe el problema abdominal y lo que es peor es que existe en los chicos ac es muy peligroso por el alimento que es peor al de los estados unidos
5985526 para m esta ley es maravillosa porque existe una discriminaci n permanente esta ley lo que hace es proteger a la poblaci n
5985527 no significar una erogaci n que supere las expectativas de cualquier econom a de una provincia es como la prevenci n en diabetes si a un paciente se le compra el calzado adecuado la zapatilla adecuada va a ser mucho m s barato que amputar una pierna
5985528 los costos directos como indirectos son tan altos y en este caso pasa exactamente lo mismo hay que ver por ejemplo que la incidencia mayor de infartos agudos de m o cardio ocurre con los pacientes con obesidad la incidencia de algunos tipos de tumores ocurre con la obesidad
5985529 si se hace prevenci n se estar disminuyendo los costos
5985530 desde hace alg n tiempo ya estamos trabajando dentro del hospital respecto de esto e incluso en el insssep tambi n se est trabajando tambi n con el doctor claudio szymula es fundamental y de gran importancia lo que se ha hecho y que de ninguna manera va aumentar los costos
5985531 lo que no es discutido son las cirug as bari tricas que tienen su indicaci n precisa y un seguimiento como corresponde los cirujanos que hacen esas intervenciones deben hacer por lo menos 130 cirug as reci n despu s se puede hacer una cirug a de tipo bari trico
5985532 lo que ocurre es que muchas veces la capacidad o capacitaci n de ese cirujano hacen cirug as la bari trica tiene sus indicaciones tiene sus costos pero si ve lo como costo directo y no como un costo de disminuci n de otras enfermedades son posibles los equ vocos
5985533 es much simo m s barato cualquier tipo de erogaci n que uno haga en cuanto a la prevenci n la cirug a bari trica es una forma de prevenci n no es un problema est tico
5985534 no no pienso en el argentino b ahora estamos pensando partido tras partido en el campeonato local siempre trabajando tranquilos porque uno intenta hacer bien las cosas para ser tenido en cuenta en este campeonato o en el pr ximo
5985535 fue un suspenso por suerte pudimos abrir el marcador aunque sea de esa forma luego tratamos de jugar y manejar el partido
5985536 hizo mucho calor y esto se hizo sentir ellos tuvieron m s la pelota en el segundo tiempo hicimos lo que pudimos pero es un cl sico y hab a que ganarlo de una u otra manera lo importante es que vamos saliendo de esa zona en donde for ever no tendr a que estar
5985537 s por suerte se me viene dando hacer goles pero ste fue especial lo grit as porque es un cl sico y entonces uno se motiva de otra forma
5985538 tranquilos hicimos correr la pelota encontramos los espacios y llegaron los goles
5985539 trabajando bien pensando en la liga y tambi n en el argentino por suerte estamos saliendo del fondo que era lo principal estamos sumando de a tres que es lo importante
5985540 se trabaja fuerte lunes martes y mi rcoles se hace f tbol el jueves para la local y el esfuerzo es grande pero es necesario porque for ever ven a en una situaci n dif cil para los promedios y se deb a sumar puntos para estar tranquilos
5985541 se piensa en el argentino b en llegar bien y que falta un mes pero en su momento el t cnico ver qui n est mejor y ah se dividir n las aguas sabemos que estamos duros que en la semana trabajamos intensamente y por ah nos falta hacer m s f tbol pero ste era un cl sico y deb amos dejar todo creo que manejamos el partido en el segundo tiempo la necesidad de ellos de ir a buscar y nos cansamos un poco pero creo que manejamos el partido y manejamos bien la diferencia
5985542 todav a falta mucho para el argentino b vamos a ver este mes que falta y veremos qu pasa estamos iguales con el paraguayo rivas y veremos qu dice gustavo jones
5985543 creo que fue un partido dif cil sobre todo en el segundo tiempo porque ellos se vinieron a remontar el 2 a 0 se complic pero mantuvimos el triunfo
5985544 no fue penal el polo alcina lo sac con el hombro ya no ten a m s chances de llegar a la pelota y le puso el cuerpo no m s el rbitro dijo que lo sac con el pecho pero es imposible eso

5985548 sarmiento no es un desastre ni mucho menos estamos bien posicionados trabajando silenciosamente la hinchada del decano debe ser realista sobre nuestra situaci n porque no estamos teniendo la precisi n de otros partidos pero adem s estamos sintiendo la ausencia de varios jugadores por expulsiones o lesiones
5985549 el partido ante for ever estuvo bien planteado improvisando algunos jugadores en algunas posiciones la evaluaci n que hago es positiva aunque l gicamente el resultado es lo que vale pensando en el partido pero estamos apuntando a un objetivo a largo plazo
5985550 haciendo medianamente bien las cosas hasta que el club pueda terminar el estadio y toda su infraestructura pero la hinchada debe quedarse tranquila que soy un profesional cuando tenga que dejar mi cargo lo voy a hacer
5985551 soy un profesional s lo que hago los resultados no nos est n ayudando pero debemos seguir formando un plantel que tenga buena trayectoria cuando sarmiento se lance a un certamen nacional pero tampoco puedo caer en quemarles etapas a chicos de quinta divisi n
5985552 el servicio de playa se fij originalmente en 15 centavos luego algunas estaciones ypf lo subieron a 18 centavos por la diferencia de precios con shell otras lo llevaron a 0 20 y ahora unificaron todas en ese valor el servicio va a seguir estable si siguen subiendo los precios de los combustibles que en realidad se tendr an que duplicar para que desaparezca el cobro separado del expendio

5985556 really source of proof please science observation proves you wrong and a habitual chronic pathological liar as well
5985557 on june 12 1980 a third explosive eruption produced 25 feet of stratification that amazed geologists successive layers are traditionally thought to require long periods of time to form yet upwards of 100 layers accumulated mostly between the nighttime hours of 9 and 12 while a plume swiftly ascended nine miles above the mountain wave after wave of pyroclastic flows began hurtling out of the crater and down the north slope each dusting the valley below with another lamination measuring from a fraction of an inch to over a yard in thickness each took from a few seconds to a few minutes to form
5985558 geologist steven austin described these pyroclastic flows as ground hugging fluidized turbulent slurries of fine volcanic debris they moved down the mountainside at hurricane speeds and left deposits of 1000 degrees f one would expect each deposit to be homogenized amp thoroughly mixed remarkably these high velocity slurries of red hot ash and pumice separated into coarse and fine particles of perfectly defined layers such features follow laws governing flows demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks
5985559 similar thin layering appears in the tapeats sandstones of the grand canyon
5985560 yup you could explain to me that you have observed first hand the layering in your septic tank too im sure there is an analogy here but it escapes me at the moment do tell what is the connection
5985561 i suppose you did read darwins radio your choice of reading materials reveals a lot dawkins specialties are fiction and fantasy not observable science his much acclaimed among fools weasel analogy was a complete fraud youre clutching at fables in a last ditch effort to avoid the conclusion that there is a god to whom you will answer one day youre not ready for that
5985562 hey bj antibiotics kill bacteria not viruses you cant kill viruses with antibiotics and viruses dont mutate in response to antibiotics theyre unaffected sheesh i would have thought you would get it the first time you were corrected your knowledge of science is pathetic and youre a very dense slow learner
5985563 so we have layer upon layer fair enough of varying thicknesses of pyroclastic flows why is that such a big deal and yet again i gave to remind you that such layers are not sedimentary
5985564 yah and bears make big potty in the woods so what are you still beating that one trick pony i regret to inform you but your hobbyhorse is dead
5985565 are you a complete freaking idjit the point is that the aggregates were not only layered but segregated according to aggregate size what you have at msh is 25 feet of finely layered segregated aggregates laid down in 3 hours not a long series of separate volcanic eruptions one ringy dingy two ringy dingy if you cant comprehend the material go back to the nursery and retrieve your binky
5985566 for anyone who just tuned in see 7 wonders of mount st helens
5985567 compare the fish pig and human embryos which animals are probably more closely related and why
5985568 they maybe layered but they formed as a result of volcanic activity so they are not sedimentary rocks sorry for shouting but hopefully it may sink in eventually
5985569 the reason it hasnt been discovered before is no right thinking paleontologist would do what mary did with her specimens we dont go to all this effort to dig this stuff out of the ground to then destroy it in acid
5985570 how many artifacts are needed to prove that man and dinosaur co existed it would seem to present a major difficulty for evolutionists to explain the representation in art or literature or in artifacts of recognizable species of dinosaurs by ancient men who supposely had never seen one alive one could surmise that perhaps they had merely come across fossils but surely they would not have had the necessary skills to assemble them and then to draw them or describe them as in life modern scientists have themselves occasionally placed the wrong heads on skeletons or combined the bones of more than one specimen this presents a problem if you believe in uniformism and evolution
5985571 actually crime is on the rise especially rape and murder it may still be low but for countries with small populations its a drastic increase on top of that scandinavia in particular norway has cultivated and spawned some powerful anti religious movements the black metal movement that grew to infamy in the 1990s hit the national newspapers with almost one hundred church burnings and espoused a venomously anti christian doctrine its adherents worshipped odin the norse gods and satan they wanted not only the continued decline of christianity but a revival of nordic paganism in addition scandinavia has a healthy population of laveyan satanists so there still religious the just don t follow the bible paganism has always been in scandinavian countries and its been on a sharp rise in the last 20 years santa clause is worshipped every year all over the world santa came from the scandinavian religions of old so there quite religious just not christian
5985572 why would i do that the bible goes all the way back to creation its not given by an angel of light

5985616 this has been a very exciting and eventful quarter for us with the approval of the first test based on our microrna technology and the acquisition of a clia certified lab both of which represent key milestones on our path to become a fully commercial company
5985617 the approval of the first test acts as strong validation to micrornas ability to be utilized as powerful biomarkers and we expect two additional tests for differentiating mesothelioma from adenocarcinomas in the lung and identifying the primary origin of a metastasis to be submitted for regulatory approval in the coming months in addition we expect to begin development of tests at our newly acquired clia lab furthermore the rapid progress in our development programs has allowed us to advance three additional cancer tests up our pipeline these tests are focused on predicting response to ovarian cancer treatment predicting risk of gastric cancer recurrence and differentiating small cell from non small cell lung cancer finally we are moving three additional diagnostics up the pipeline the first is being developed to detect the presence of colon cancer in serum the second is being developed to detect the presence of bladder cancer and the third is being developed to predict colon cancer risk of recurrence after surgery rosetta genomics will continue its rapid pace towards commercialization of microrna based tests

5985652 der in georgien entfesselte krieg war der h hepunkt der versuche russland einzukreisen und zu isolieren wir sprechen uns gegen solche versuche aus weil dies unseres erachtens eine fortsetzung der us politik aus den zeiten des kalten krieges ist das was russland gemacht hat war der schutz der eigenen legitimen interessen

5985665 is it right for a barrister to receive 100 000 from a third party where there has never been a fee note rendered to the solicitor instructing him i would have thought the law society would have real concerns about that

5985670 the majority of clinics operating will be in areas where physical isolation from the wards can be maintained
5985671 there are a small number of patients who will be seen within the main hospital due to their clinical need and specialised equipment
5985672 these areas have not had patients with symptoms during the past two weeks
5985673 anybody with diarrhoea or vomiting should stay away from work or school until they have been free of all symptoms for 48 hours

5985690 the end goal is to go as electronic as we can while giving our consumers more options
5985691 with ebill instead of checking your mailbox you check your e mail with ebills consumers have the option of making an electronic payment instead of writing a check
5985692 our convenient one click solution allows for payment within seconds of receiving your utility bill http www striata com without the need to remember a username amp password or visit even a single web page
5985693 whats so extraordinary about this project is that average paper turn off adoption for utilities is far less than 10 over three years irea starting with no customer email addresses at all has enrolled 14 of their total members within the first month
5985694 all i can say is that when i was a young rider coming through the ranks i remember seeing jason queally who id trained with win that gold in sydney
5985695 i saw him standing on the podium and i knew then that he was clean
5985696 i knew hed won an olympic gold medal clean and that i was the day i thought wow if he can do it i can do it
5985697 sadly there are always going to be suspicions that this hasnt come out of the blue but its been 12 years in the making
5985698 what was surprising to me was not that we stepped up a whole new level because there are reasons for that our preparation and our planning
5985699 the press corps will also assist the purc as a body to educate the general public on its core function of regulating and overseeing the provision of the highest quality of electricity and water services to consumers and also protect the interests of utility services providers and consumers
5985700 because there is no nursery or day care centre here most of the parents send their children to the markets or their farms until in the evening when they return but i am not happy with the situation and therefore decided to establish the school
5985701 from what weve learned in the first three months people seem to have a huge thirst for legal news
5985702 the theory behind originally launching it was that people loved the law and order s and the csi s and the crime shows and legal shows if theres that fascination on tv that the same fascination would come in print
5985703 its conceived for a younger audience more of a blue collar audience
5985704 we try to pick topics and write that in such a way that would appeal to ordinary folks
5985705 if the right set of circumstances arose and i saw the opportunity to do something like the investigative series the washington post is doing right now on chandra levy we would absolutely go for that
5985706 its tough to say what we are its quick and fun it gives you your news your gossip your sports but doesnt give you too much of it we know young adults are going to find more information about something if they want it
5985707 the goal is to get about a third of our publication to be user generated
5985708 one thing thats interesting about our idea of the daily conversation and user generated content is that its a real advance from where print media had been especially in the past
5985709 were going to give you the news and youre going to digest it and if you have a response then write a letter to the editor
5985710 this is much more a continual feedback loop which is indicative of the age of technology that were in and the feedback style people are used to in the online world
5985711 we are putting a new product out there that should give us more shelf space
5985712 its trying to reach a new audience its trying to create business and create readership in a market that we havent touched thats really the exciting part to see the baltimore sun media group investing in that this is what we need to do to evolve as a company i dont think newspapers will go anywhere but i think youll see them change and flourish because people will still want to have that a hard copy in their hands
5985713 the landscape has changed in such a way that there are a lot more niche publications now than there were a decade or two ago
5985714 people are intrigued by these exhibit a is obviously a very distinct publication a free publication the reader and the marketplace is more open to something like this today and more willing to try it than they would have been two decades ago
5985715 people today seem to want to get news the way they want it and on topics they want to hear about
5985716 we can focus on one thing and serve our audience really well
5985717 normal banking transactions have been disrupted across 40 000 branches all over the country
5985718 facilities and services at all airports including kolkata have not been disrupted
5985719 in fact many experts believe that the fiscal regime is what separates those economies where petroleum has made difference to the overall living standards of citizens from where it has not
5985720 our challenge rather is how to take these lessons and experiences and use them to develop the rules and guidelines that will yield the maximum direct and indirect benefit for all ghanaians

5985728 that is the investment that has been made in this complex and with such modernisation the government expects the highest level of efficiency and accountability
5985729 it was the amount of lockdown that surprised me the most
5985730 technology is an important thing in my personal and work life and i think the two of them should be connected
5985731 we see this as a real opportunity to start altering the cost model to deliver it
5985732 we think that this is the biggest most fundamental change we have made
5985733 from 2000 to the end of 2007 ebay kind of fought the trends they tried to keep auctions the focus of the company
5985734 we believe by making the fees more success based buyers will have more choice better values and that sellers will sell more
5985735 we wanted to make sure that the trust factors were in place
5985736 the vocal minority is going to be exceedingly vocal about this
5985737 i think it is a great step and for the fixed price sellers it is a big step

5985742 something really shifted in the bush administration once it realized comprehensive immigration reform was not going to pass on its watch
5985743 when they saw the public policy battle was lost they moved instead to public relations the strategy now is to shore up the republican base by demonstrating a big flashy show of force
5985744 when ice informed us that some of our employees had gone outside the law by providing false documentation we cooperated with them on the enforcement action

5985766 true we never have all the facts when doing a case study but it is instructive to imagine ourselves as the executives and board members in a situation and ask ourselves what obvious mistakes we seem to have made what might have been the extenuating circumstances and whether we should really be forgiven for the mistake even given those imagined constraints
5985767 the automotive industry is now focusing on its environmental obligations to reduce co2 emissions and improve efficiencies and we are seeing the high technology capabilities of lotus engineering being in strong demand not only does our brand value of performance through light weight fit perfectly with the necessary direction of the industry to produce lighter more efficient vehicles we are also working on all aspects of future fuels investigating alternative powertrains to accommodate alcohol fuels as they enter the market
5985768 alcohols possess superior combustion characteristics to gasoline which allow greater optimisation taking full advantage of the benefits of sustainable bio alcohols will ensure a greater percentage of vehicle miles will be travelled using renewable fuels we are delighted with the investment from defra which will assist this partnership in taking forward research development and the demonstration of this environmentally conscious transport solution
5985769 the requirement to operate on gasoline in todays flex fuel engines limits their thermal efficiency when operating on alcohol fuels however the physical and chemical properties of alcohols when compared to gasoline provide the potential for higher thermal efficiency operation to be achieved this singlecylinder research engine will investigate a highly thermal efficient combustion system that optimises engine performance to fully exploit the properties of both gasoline and alcohol fuels and maximise efficiency
5985770 this is not sportscenter this is much more outside the lines

5985775 its important to understand what the program is designed to do and how much flexibility the degree offers
5985776 a caution i throw out for undergraduates is that they spend four years with a degree with the word sports in it and 10 years later they dont want to do sports anymore that degree wont be as flexible
5985777 five years ago many thought if they got a degree in sport management that was their ticket to work in professional sports in the four major sports leagues football baseball basketball hockey
5985778 but now they realize that those jobs are few and far between and the turnover is small
5985779 we wanted to produce a large number of disease models for ourselves our collaborators and the stem cell research community to accelerate research

5985802 unlikely to require the divestiture of heathrow unless the sale of gatwick or stansted is likely to be impractical or ineffective
5985803 aspects of government policy restrict or distort competition by contributing to the current capacity constraints at baas london airports
5985804 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa but also for a review of the governments air transport white paper the commission risks delaying the delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
5985805 separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
5985806 we have provisionally found that there are significant competition problems arising from baas common ownership of seven uk airports
5985807 this is evident from a large number of factors including its lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity
5985808 this has resulted in investment that is not tailored to the requirements of airport users and lower levels and quality of service for both airlines and passengers
5985809 we have also provisionally found that there are competition problems arising from the planning system aspects of government policy and the system of regulation
5985810 while we accept that constraints on runway capacity in the south east will limit the scope for the benefits of competition in the short term we believe that separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
5985811 over time we would expect these to increase significantly in scotland where there are no similar capacity constraints we believe separate owners of edinburgh and glasgow would similarly improve their offerings
5985812 baa has argued to us that there is no scope for competition to develop so long as there are capacity constraints we take the opposite view unless the market is opened up to competition there is a serious risk that the current capacity constraints will persist certainly for longer than in a better functioning market
5985813 the earliest new runway capacity will become available is 2015 at stansted with no additional runway capacity possible at heathrow before 2020
5985814 while we accept that government policy and the planning regime have contributed to the lack of capacity we have found that baa as the owner and operator of these london airports has played a major role in not pressing for more capacity sooner and in planning terminal and runway capacity on a conservative and sequential process such that its plans for one airport have been influenced by its plans elsewhere we accept however that baa has been more successful in undertaking several smaller projects simultaneously
5985815 in scotland baa has until recently been noticeably slow to develop new routes at glasgow and edinburgh while at aberdeen its investment plans are regarded as unambitious despite relatively high levels of profitability at southampton it has shown a reluctance to respond to its customers demands
5985816 by the differences in approach to both airline customers and development between baa and owners and operators of regional airports
5985817 we have identified significant competition between several pairs of such airports with benefits which include lower charges development of new routes and a far greater responsiveness to customers in terms of capacity development we note that both manchester and london city airports have expanded successfully without explicit government support
5985818 in regard to regulation we have found that the civil aviation authority caa is constrained by the current statutory framework and that consideration needs to be given to bring it closer into line with those of other sectoral regulators such as energy water and telecommunications with better defined duties objectives and powers including the protection of the interests of consumers the promotion of competition and the ability to impose economic licence conditions
5985819 there is also scope for the caa to play a more active role in facilitating agreement between baa and the airlines by ensuring an appropriate framework for consultation which is currently seriously lacking
5985820 the significant problems in the baa airports market will not be solved overnight and changes in ownership would only be a first step in freeing up the market and providing greater scope for more flexible development
5985821 changes to regulation may similarly be important and there could be benefits available from a less prescriptive government policy on airport capacity development though we recognise decisions on such policies which are wholly for government will be taken in a broader decision framework
5985822 the commissions findings should be assessed in the light of the urgent need for new airport capacity and a modern regulatory framework as well as the need which we recognise for improved service from the airport operator
5985823 the findings state that the lack of runway capacity is a main reason for what it calls the current poor standards of service and the lack of resilience at times of disruption which results in regular delays
5985824 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa but also for a review of the governments air transport white paper the commission risks delaying the delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
5985825 we will be seeking urgent clarification from the government of how it believes this reports findings can be reconciled with the air transport policy it established in 2003 and its current review of economic regulation
5985826 we note however that this is not the end of the competition commission process and we will continue to point out to the commission the many areas where we believe its analysis is flawed and its remedies would be disproportionate and counter productive
5985827 just as the government is about to make the decisions that could lead to the first full length runways being built in the south east since the second world war the commission risks creating uncertainty delay and confusion at exactly the wrong time
5985828 in scotland the commission has apparently ignored the evidence presented by baa and supported by numerous respected third party organisations that clearly demonstrates that edinburgh and glasgow airports serve separate markets and therefore do not and would not compete regardless of ownership
5985829 we welcome the commissions comprehensive report into the market power of the baa monopoly and fully endorse its findings
5985830 competition works monopolies dont baas monopoly control over the london airports has been highly detrimental to competition and consumers
5985831 baa has long ignored the needs of its airline users and the travelling public and provided inefficient gold plated facilities encouraged by an ineffectual regulator the civil aviation authority
5985832 the liberation of stansted airport from the dead hand of the baa monopoly will be a great first step in the recovery of uk aviation which for far too long has suffered gross inefficiencies long queues and high costs
5985833 it is essential that competition within and between london airports is promoted along with effective regulation to the benefit of passengers tourism and the economy
5985834 on behalf of our 25 million customers at stansted we now hope that stansted will at last listen to its customers by reversing their 100 price hike eliminate long queues and build efficient facilities which users actually need
5985835 we remain of the view that glasgow and edinburgh airports serve separate markets and that competition between the two is highly unlikely regardless of ownership
5985836 this is a view shared by many of scotlands leading business organisations and is based on detailed and robust evidence we are disappointed the commission has chosen to take a different view following what appears to be a flawed analysis of our airports and without presenting compelling evidence to support its case
5985837 we are also surprised by the suggestion that a greater level of regulation may be required at aberdeen airport
5985838 we strongly believe baas stewardship of aberdeen edinburgh and glasgow airports has served scotland well
5985839 the first thing you have to say is that one of the problems of having all three heathrow gatwick and stansted in the same ownership has been a lack of push to get additional capacity in those airports because they have nobody to compete to drag other airlines to their facility
5985840 there is no competition gatwick management is not saying lets try and drag those airlines out of heathrow to come to gatwick offering better facilities and better prices and so you just get this lethargy of development you get one project at a time
5985841 while t5 has been going on really nothing else has been going on in terms of development so i think a lot of it is to do with just getting that additional capacity into the marketplace
5985842 we think each of the london airports should be separately owned
5985843 i should say that there is likely to be an inclination on our part to give the incumbent owner that is baa the opportunity to hold on to heathrow and we would require therefore the sale of gatwick and stansted
5985844 heathrow has special characteristics its the only hub airport in the south east of england indeed the only hub airport in the whole of the uk
5985845 it attracts airlines because of its superior connectivity in other words its links with other parts of the world it has a much higher level of transfer traffic and given its importance and its particular market position we think it may be that heathrow needs special consideration in terms of remedies
5985846 we have given evidence of our own experiences to the commissions inquiry and we believe that todays provisional findings are good news for passengers and airlines
5985847 mag is an experienced uk owned airport operator with a strong track record in investing in the passenger experience delivering efficient operations a partnership approach to our business relationships managing our costs effectively and a world leading environmental performance
5985848 we have consistently stated that the group is interested in acquiring assets that will add value for our shareholders and this could include one or more of the baa airports
5985849 we are currently examining the details of todays report before making any decision about future acquisitions

5985911 if the gods have neither the power nor the desire to help us if they have no interest whatever and they pay no attention to our activities if there is nothing which can percolate from them to affect our human lives what reason have we for addressing any acts of worship or honors or prayers to the immortal gods
5985912 i should defend the beliefs about the immortal gods which we have inherited from our ancestors together with our sacrifices ceremonies and religious observances i shall indeed defend them and i have always done so no words from any person whether learned or unlearned will ever budge me from the views which i inherited from our ancestors concerning the worship of the immortal gods
5985913 i have gained better instruction on how to worship the immortal gods guided by pontifical law and ancestral custom from those miniature sacrificial bowls bequeathed to us by numa and described by laelius in his little speech which is pure gold than from the explanations of the stoics

5986098 diese sogenannten sieben wahrheiten zu angeblich berh hten pensionen in deutschland haben mit der realit t nichts zu tun so ein quatsch schafft es nur im sommerloch in die medien
5986099 erstens ist die pension eine vollversorgung bei vergleichen mit durchschnittsrenten m ssen betriebs und zusatzrenten ber cksichtigt werden au erdem gilt das verfassungsm ig gesch tzte alimentationsprinzip auch im ruhestand zweitens ist hinsichtlich der zuk nftigen versorgungsausgaben durch versorgungsr cklagen und fonds vorsorge getroffen zudem haben sich die prognosen der zu erwartenden lasten durch die zahlreichen sparma nahmen und ausgebliebene besoldungszuw chse der letzten jahre nicht unerheblich verbessert drittens wird anders als in bild behauptet bei der rente zur zeit weder riester noch nachhaltigkeitsfaktor angewendet f r versorgungsempf nger gilt der riesterfaktor uneingeschr nkt viertens wird die verl ngerung der lebensarbeitszeit selbstverst ndlich wirkungsgleich auf die beamten bertragen
5986100 was hier gemacht wird ist kein vergleich pfel und birnen mehr sondern eher eier mit wassermelonen die durchschnittsrente und die mindestversorgung ins verh ltnis zu setzen und dabei alle unterschiede in berechnung und begr ndung au er acht zu lassen ist wirklich abenteuerlich mit wahrheiten hat das gar nichts zu tun
5986101 das vertrauen unserer kunden ist uns besonders wichtig deswegen k nnen interessierte auf www flug de und www travel overland de nicht nur zwischen linien charter und low cost carriern vergleichen sondern auch sicher gehen dass neben den endpreisen nur fl ge angezeigt werden die auch tats chlich verf gbar sind

5986108 at that time the national park service had a somewhat different philosophy about where to place visitors centers it was to put them as close as possible to historic resources
5986109 had the expansion gone forward that would be the issue it would be a bigger blemish
5986110 it just means were starting to do things in the right way
5986111 were making less mistakes were starting to believe in what were doing it just validates the work that weve done its good but still theres a long ways to go its just nice to be there right now
5986112 i dont think weve played particularly bad in any of these games but tonight was one bad inning
5986113 we set the table for them and cracked it open further with an error and those guys capped it off with a hit we just didnt get it done late weve been doing a terrific job of that but not tonight
5986114 weve been pitching well its just at the end we cracked the door for them and let them win
5986115 its frustrating because we didnt play well enough certainly in the eighth inning theres not much more you can say about it
5986116 getting a working vmtools installation into a freshly upgraded ubuntu 8 04 is a simple matter of rebuilding the right modules against the newer kernel and rolling them up into a tarball

5986118 in theory with the right signatures the right security class implementations some eye of newt and a pinch of garlic its possible to get things down to a one time install which would make the component available everywhere

5986210 there are a lot of gaps that still need to be closed

5986226 the afghan people still suffer massively in the war against terrorism and in the war for stability in afghanistan
5986227 the reason we are still around is because of the immense resilience of the afghan people and their goodheartedness toward the presence of the international community

5986236 this summers forecast and unusual early melting events all around the arctic serve as a dire warning of how quickly the polar regions are being affected by climate change
5986237 if norways average temperature this year equals that in 2007 the ice cap in the arctic will all melt away which is highly possible judging from current conditions
5986238 the arctic did not experience the meltdowns forecast by nsidc and the norwegian polar year secretariat it didnt even come close additionally some current graphs and press releases from nsidc seem less than conservative there appears to be a consistent pattern of overstatement related to arctic ice loss

5986262 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families now as we prepare for the winter its time for us to be more serious about our home heating oil needs and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
5986263 we need to drill offshore and we need to do it now if i were president i would call congress back into session and tell them to get to work
5986264 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5986265 you all served together and fought together and bled together under the same proud flag you did not serve a red america or a blue america you served the united states of america
5986266 i have never suggested or never will that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition
5986267 i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
5986268 he hasnt been a senator all that long so he doesnt have a long track record on veterans issues and thats what most of these guys are concerned with
5986269 theres a whole set of factors that go into the ultimate cost of energy
5986270 weve also said the green energy has to be in addition to victorias existing renewable energy targets and those two commitments make it very clear that it will be additional green power that is sourced to meet the governments commitments
5986271 and i think that shows the governments credibility in ensuring the impact of this plant is minimised
5986272 every time we make a commitment to build something like this that increases emissions we are going a step backwards
5986273 the government made the decision to go ahead with it so they are not going to come up with an ees that says its not a goer it was a fait accompli
5986274 no long term or irreversible damage to the environment from the project has been identified

5986284 qued sorprendido no tanto porque el proyecto prosperara sino porque nunca imagin que el m o iba a ser el nico voto negativo
5986285 no existen impedimentos normativos pero no lo veo leg timo en t rminos hist ricos culturales y pol ticos no se consult a sectores que podr an haber manifestado oposici n a este proyecto como las asociaciones vecinales si viviera rosas no hubiera resistido un juicio de la verdad a la hora de argumentar este homenaje una diputada dijo que rosas no ten a una m sera calle en la ciudad aunque olvid decir que su imagen est presente en el billete de 20 pesos que sus restos fueron repatriados de inglaterra y que tiene un monumento en palermo

5986290 algunos colegas tomaron este proyecto como uno m s de los que a diario votamos para denominar calles monumentos y canteros sin reparar en la connotaci n pol tica ni en el inter s de los vecinos de villa urquiza muchos diputados carecen de ideolog a y se prestaron a esta provocaci n

5986298 we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is a recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness isnt there a fairytale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan
5986299 to be honest there just arent top quality men here
5986300 they are too busy drinking xxxx to notice the women and all they do is whistle or yell or beep as you go past those sorts of communication skills which i just love

5986320 shes bubbly and vocal and someone who really wanted it she had a passion and clearly a talent
5986321 i was treated like a star with my own driver and security guards who would clear the path for us by saying things like designers coming through but one thing i found out about a reality show is that its not reality at all
5986322 being asked to act surprised for four takes really qualifies more as acting doesnt it

5986331 i think the same kind of places would have been right around 600 000 for one bedroom one bath loft condos
5986332 it was a waiting game for those to come down to my price range
5986333 values have dropped to a point where investors are coming in and buying those properties because they can get positive cash flow now
5986334 traditionally we have a little bump after labor day but weve had a bump in summertime and we have these reos coming online every day
5986335 it has very limited options and is more limited by the day which is unfortunate considering all the money they are putting into it
5986336 despite the turmoil in the industry we will complete the modernization of our airport
5986337 this is the worst financial crisis in commercial aviation history
5986338 in the future we can expect to see more airlines fail and passengers will see higher fares
5986339 it is a good economic measure and it shows that we are trying to move forward together
5986340 they tend to want to fly in and out of the same airport because it just becomes a habit there is cumulative impact on san jose that is severe

5986359 all history is about roads until the airplane came along
5986360 the reason were sitting here today is because the road came through
5986361 it was the only way through the two counties after a flood that you didnt have to cross a river
5986362 when the military cut the road they werent just going off into uncharted territory
5986363 it looked very much like any other log home with a spinning wheel and a cast iron skillet
5986364 in the 1820s the cherokee nation was only a fraction of what it once was
5986365 then three things happened that were bad for the cherokees
5986366 the trail of tears really started on the front porch of every cherokee household
5986367 the worst conditions really were during the roundup when they used bayonets to herd them conditions were similar to civil war prison camps they werent quite as bad along the trip because they could travel and have food along the way
5986368 she was 13 and shed traveled with her family 1 800 miles

5986377 he wore a top hat and a yellow duster and black pants stuffed into black boots
5986378 they traveled day and night giving new meaning to are we there yet
5986379 his wife ran the station there he built a hotel across the street and the stable set about where fayetteville city hall is today
5986380 the butterfield overland express was the first overland transcontinental mail by stagecoach
5986381 it was the longest stagecoach line in world history 2 812 miles the butterfield stage line was a major factor in the settlement of arkansas and the west before the civil war
5986382 troops march down the road and they encounter other troops thats where the battle happens thats what happened at pea ridge
5986383 the battle was there because of the road from st louis to fort smith everybody used the same road the army went up and down it many times going to the indian territory
5986384 pea ridge was the largest battle west of the mississippi
5986385 arkansas at that time was the hinterlands the frontier was 20 miles away
5986386 the road was only as wide as a wagon and marching at just four men across it took a long time
5986387 the parks visitor center is where curtis makes last stand
5986388 it was so loud they could hear it in fayetteville and springfield it was the first thunder in the ozarks in march it was artillery
5986389 it was stocked full of food pickles sardines oysters eggs
5986390 they were eating not fighting and their ammunition train was far behind they had no ammunition
5986391 the wire road got more use in december 1862 union brig gen frances herron on his way to fayetteville passed the body of his dead horse lying there from a previous battle they used these roads all the time
5986392 people from the same county fought on both sides the first washington artillery for the union was out of fayetteville
5986393 the only people left were those who had no way to go
5986394 that tears at society it was so bad in northwest arkansas they built fortified towns southern towns and northern towns and set up blockades of the mail for the most part it worked

5986411 farmers can easily plant 200 plants per acre as an intercrop and they can get additional income of nearly rs 20 000 us 500 net of the expenses this will be additional income to the farmers
5986412 in an acre i cultivated about 200 plants and after various processes like fermentation and drying we earn more than rs 40 000 us 1 000 through cocoa cultivation for coconuts we get only rs 30 000 us 750 per acre but with cocoa we can get more money which is a double income in one field for us
5986413 it gives a lot of organic matter to the soil it prevents weed growth in coconut farms so the farmer is going to spend lesser money on controlling weeds moreover the coconut is providing shade to the cocoa plant for its better growth and with the mulch that is provided by the cocoa water conservation is done so less and less water is required overall for both the crops
5986414 weve received a surprising number of phone calls with people providing information

5986420 hes refusing to sign the conditions the judge imposed on him yesterday
5986421 his attorney made it clear he was going to agree to the new terms
5986422 the court basically said the defendant has the option at any time to sign the conditions of release
5986423 if he does so the jail will release him if not and he chooses to remain in custody the court date will remain as previously set
5986424 its clear that its excessive and beyond the needs of the developer
5986425 it is completely counter to everything that made the pleasure point community what it is today

5986442 it was literally nonsensical from a productive standpoint the meeting doesnt make sense because theres nothing to talk about yet
5986443 it really boils down to some people dont want it no matter what
5986444 i have a family in scotts valley i have a business in scotts valley
5986445 i have the same concerns everyone else does but i want to see the outcome
5986446 we dont see any of our mps members of parliament moving that way as you are well aware i am one of the more critical mps within the national front critical of my own leadership but you dont see me jumping ship to the other side so i believe he is just putting us off balance due to the by elections
5986447 whether we can win or not that is a big question but i am happy to say that the response by the voters towards our own candidate is very positive because he is the local man there and he speaks the lingo
5986448 i think we have a small chance to win a victory for barisan would of course signal the end of anwar ibrahim as the so called prodigal son of permatang pauh quite a majority of people do not see him as a potential prime minister including people from the opposition
5986449 whats funny is that people have a different image of me than what is really here
5986450 i was willing to take chances but i didnt have a clear vision about anything i am just a very simple human being probably everyone else is too we need to share that and do the best we can with what we have
5986451 we figured we couldnt change it by referendum the powers that be werent going to give up power so we opted for a suit
5986452 people get better representation when they have someone to talk to in their district but i really feel when you have a mayor at large everybody in the city gets to vote for the mayor

5986455 the war is terrifying horrifying for civilians and we cant let it go on the french presidency of the european union council like all the countries of the eu is concerned and sometimes indignant at what is happening on its doorstep we must therefore try together with the americans and with the russians of course who are a participant in this conflict to stop the killing

5986461 effective execution of agenda 21 will require a profound reorientation of all human society unlike anything the world has ever experienced a major shift in the priorities of both governments and individuals and an unprecedented redeployment of human and financial resources this shift will demand that a concern for the environmental consequences of every human action be integrated into individual and collective decision making at every level
5986462 each local authority should enter into a dialogue with its citizens local organizations and private enterprises and formulate a local agenda 21 through consultation and consensus building local authorities would learn from citizens and from local civic community business and industrial organizations and acquire the information needed for formulating the best strategies
5986463 the concept of national sovereignty has been an immutable indeed sacred principle of international relations it is a principle which will yield only slowly and reluctantly to the new imperatives of global environmental cooperation it is simply not feasible for sovereignty to be exercised unilaterally by individual nation states however powerful the global community must be assured of environmental security
5986464 it is the responsibility of each human being today to choose between the force of darkness and the force of light we must therefore transform our attitudes and adopt a renewed respect for the
5986465 current lifestyles and consumption patterns of the affluent middle class involving high meat intake use of fossil fuels appliances air conditioning and suburban housing are not sustainable a shift is necessary which will require a vast strengthening of the multilateral system including the united nations
5986466 the root causes of the loss of biodiversity are embedded in the way societies use resources this world view is characteristic of large scale societies heavily dependent on resources brought from considerable distances it is a world view that is characterized by the denial of sacred attributes in nature a characteristic that became firmly established about 2000 years ago with the judeo christian islamic religious traditions eastern cultures with religious traditions such as buddhism jainism and hinduism did not depart as drastically from the perspective of humans as members of a community of beings including other living and non living elements

5986482 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
5986483 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
5986484 a key drug uptake transporter called oatp1a2 involved in shuttling drugs from the small intestine to the bloodstream
5986485 blocking this transporter reduces drug absorption and neutralizes their potential benefits
5986486 by contrast drugs whose levels are boosted in the presence of grapefruit juice appear to block an important drug metabolizing enzyme called cyp3a4 that normally breaks down drugs
5986487 im sure well find more and more drugs that are affected this way

5986534 wahai rasulullah akan tetapi aku tidak berkenan jika dia menjadi suamiku aku adalah wanita terpandang pada kaumku dan putri pamanmu maka aku tidak mau melaksanakannya
5986535 dan tidaklah patut bagi laki laki yang mumin dan tidak pula bagi perempuan mukmin apabila allah dan rasul nya telah menetapkan suatu ketetapan akan ada bagi mereka pilihan yang lain tentang urusan urusan mereka dan barangsiapa yang mendurhakai allah dan rasul nya maka sungguhlah dia telah sesat sesat yang nyata
5986536 dan ingatlah ketika kamu berkata kepada orang yang allah telah melimpahkan nikmat kepadanya dan kamu juga telah memberi nikmat kepadanya
5986537 rasulullah shallall hu alaihi wa sallam bersabda kepada para istrinya orang yang paling cepat menyusulku diantara kalian adalah yang paling panjang tangannya
5986538 allah akan menjaga kita wahai abu qasim bergembiralah wahai putra pamanku dan teguhkanlah hatimu
5986539 demi yang jiwaku ada ditangan nya sesungguhnya engkau adalah seorang nabi bagi umat ini pastilah mereka akan mendustakan dirimu menyakiti dirimu mengusir dirimu dan akan memerangimu
5986540 betul tiada seorang pun yang membawa sebagaimana yang engkau bawa melainkan pasti ada yang menentangnya
5986541 hai orang orang yang berkemul berselimut bangunlah lalu berilah peringatan
5986542 apakah manusia itu mengira bahwa mereka dibiarkan saja mengatakan kami telah beriman sedangkan mereka tidak diuji lagi
5986543 demi allah wahai paman seandainya mereka mampu meletakkan matahari di tangan kananku dan bulan di tangan kiriku agar aku meninggalkan urusan dakwah ini maka sekali kali aku tidak akan meninggalkannya hingga allah memenangkannya atau aku yang binasa karenannya
5986544 sebaik baik wanita adalah maryam binti imran sebaik baik wanita adalah khadijah binti khuwailid
5986545 saya tidak pernah melihat seorang yang lebih berakal lebih mulia dan lebih wara dari abu hanifah
5986546 wahai amirul muminin sesungguhnya aku adalah orang asing di baghdad aku tidak memiliki tempat untuk menyimpan uang sebanyak ini dan aku takut kalau nanti ia akan hilang maka dari itu jika boleh aku minta tolong agar ia disimpankan di baitul mal sehingga jika aku membutuhkan aku akan mengambilnya
5986547 semoga allah merahmati abu hanifah dia telah memperdayaiku ia telah menolak sesuatu pun dari pemberian kami
5986548 ini adalah laba dari barang dagangan kalian yang diberi oleh allah melalui tanganku demi allah aku tidaklah memberi kalian sedikitpun dari hartaku akan tetapi ia adalah karunia dari allah bagi kalian melalui tanganku tidaklah seseorang memiliki daya untuk mendapatkan rizki kecuali dari allah
5986549 sesungguhnya aku membutuhkan pakaian dari bahan al khizz wahai abu hanifah
5986550 aku tidaklah bergurau karena aku telah membeli pakaian ini dan yang satunya lagi dengan harga dua puluh dinar emas plus satu dirham perak kemudian aku menjual salah satunya dengan dua puluh dinar emas sehingga tersisa satu dirham dan aku tidak akan mengambil untung dari teman dekatku sendiri
5986551 sungguh aku adalah seorang perempuan yang sudah tua dan aku tidak tahu harga barang sedangkan baju pesananku adalah amanah seseorang maka juallah baju itu dengan harga belinya kemudian tambahkan sedikit laba atasnya karena sesungguhnya aku orang miskin
5986552 sesungguhnya aku telah membeli dua jenis pakaian dengan satu akad transaksi kemudian aku jual salah satunya kurang empat dirham dari harga modal maka ambillah pakaian itu dengan harga empat dirham itu dan aku tidak akan meminta laba darimu
5986553 angkat sajadah ini dan ambillah apa yang ada di bawahnya
5986554 sesungguhnya aku seorang yang mampu berkecukupan dan sungguh allah telah memberiku nikmat nya sehingga aku tidak membutuhkan uang tersebut
5986555 jika allah telah memberimu nikmat maka di mana bekas dan tanda nikmata nya itu tidakkah sampai kepadamu bahwasanya rasulullah saw telah bersabda
5986556 sesungguhnya allah suka melihat bekas nikmat nya pada diri hamba nya
5986557 apabila kamu mau menjualnya maka terangkanlah kepada pembeli tentang cacat yang ada pada barang tersebut
5986558 wahai abu abdillah betapa jauhnya abu hanifah dari sifat menggunjing aku sama sekali tidak pernah mendengar ia berkata tentang kejelekan musuhnya
5986559 sesungguhnya abu hanifah sangat waras sekali sehingga tidak mungkin melakukan hal yang dapat menghapus kebaikan kebaikannya
5986560 sesungguhnya orang yang kamu lihat ini tidak pernah tidur malam
5986561 sesungguhnya diriku di sisi manusia berbeda dengan apa yang aku lakukan di sisi allah demi allah sejak saat ini tidak boleh ada lagi orang yang berkata tentangku apa yang tidak aku lakukan aku tidak akan tidur di malam hari hingga aku menjumpai allah wafat
5986562 sebenarnya hari kiamat itulah hari yang dijanjikan kepada mereka dan kiamat itu lebih dahsyat dan lebih pahit
5986563 abu hanifah adalah seorang yang sangat keras pembelaannya terhadap hak hak allah yang tidak boleh dilanggar banyak diam dan selalu berfikir
5986564 ia adalah bin tsabit seorang yang apabila mengatakan bahwasanya tiang masjid ini adalah emas maka perkataannya itu tentulah menjadi hujjah dan sungguh benar benar tiang itu akan keluar seperti yang dikatakannya itu
5986565 saya datang kepadamu hendak melamar anak perempuanmu untuk salah seorang sahabatku
5986566 silahkan wahai imam sesungguhnya orang seperti dirimu tidak akan ditolak apabila meminta sesuatu tetapi kalau boleh tahu siapakah orang yang mau menikahi anak perempuanku itu
5986567 seseorang yang dikenal oleh kaumnya dengan kemuliaan dan kekayaan dermawan dan ringan tangan serta suka membantu orang lain hafal kitab allah azza wa jalla selalu menghidupkan seluruh malamnya untuk beribadah dan banyak menangis karena takutnya kepada allah
5986568 cukuplah wahai abu hanifah sesungguhnya sebagian dari sifat yang engkau sebutkan tadi telah menjadikan orang itu pantas untuk menikahi anak perempuan amirul muminin
5986569 akan tetapi ia memiliki satu sifat yang harus engkau pertimbangkan
5986570 ia seorang yahudi apakah engkau akan memintaku untuk menikahkan anak perempuanku dengan seorang yahudi wahai abu hanifah demi allah aku tidak akan melakukannya sekalipun ia memiliki semua sifat baik dari kaum terdahulu hingga yang terakhir
5986571 engkau menolak untuk menikahkan anak perempuanmu dengan seorang yahudi dan engkau sangat mengingkarinya kemudian engkau mengatakan kepada orang banyak bahwasanya rasulullah saw telah menikahkan kedua putri beliau dengan seorang yahudi
5986572 aku memohon ampun kepada allah dari perkataan jelek yang telah aku katakan dan aku bertaubat kepada nya dari kedustaan yang pernah aku lakukan
5986573 dari perkataanmu tentang dibolehkannya menentukan satu hakim untuk memutuskan apa yang terjadi antara ali dan muawiyah
5986574 jika kita berselisih tentang apa yang kita perdebatkan siapakah yang akan menjadi hakim antara kita
5986575 wahai fulan jadilah engkau penengah di antara kami tentang apa yang kami perselisihkan
5986576 aku ridlo temanmu menjadi penengah antara kita apakah kamu juga demikian
5986577 celakalah kamu bagaimana kamu membolehkan adanya penengah di antara kita tentang apa yang kita perselisihkan sedangkan kamu mengingkari adanya di antara dua sahabat rasulullah saw
5986578 aku ingin berbincang bincang denganmu tentang beberapa perkara yang telah aku siapkan
5986579 berbincang bincang denganmu adalah merupakan aib dan membicarakan tentang apa yang kamu yakini adalah seperti api yang menyala
5986580 bagaimana engkau menghukumiku demikian sedangkan engkau belum pernah bertemu denganku sebelumnya dan belum pernah mendengar perkataanku
5986581 sesungguhnya hal yang demikian telah tersebar dan terkenal di kalangan orang awam maupun para ulama sehingga boleh bagiku untuk berkata demikian karena berita tentangmu telah mutawatir
5986582 apakah sampai saat ini kamu belum tahu tentang iman sehingga kamu bertanya kepadaku tentangnya
5986583 aku tahu akan tetapi aku merasa ragu pada salah satu macamnya
5986584 kamu tidak boleh mensifatiku dengan kekufuran sebelum kamu mendengar apa yang membuatku kafir
5986585 kabarkanlah kepadaku tentang seorang yang meyakini akan keberadaan allah dengan hatinya dan ia yakin bahwasanya allah adalah esa dan tiada sekutu baginya ia juga tahu tentang sifat sifat allah dan yakin bahwasanya tidak ada sesuatupun yang menyamai nya kemudian ia mati akan tetapi tidak menyatakan keimanannya itu dengan lisannya apakah ia mati dalan keadaan mukmin atau kafir
5986586 ia mati dalam keadaan kafir dan termasuk ahli neraka jika ia tidak menyatakan dengan lisannya tentang apa yang diyakini hatinya kecuali jika ada sesuatu sebab yang menghalanginya untuk menyatakan keimanan dengan lisannya
5986587 bagaimana ia tidak menjadi mukmin sedangkan ia telah benar benar meyakini adanya allah
5986588 jika kamu beriman kepada dan kamu menjadikannya sebagai hujjah maka aku akan menjawab pertanyaanmu dengannya tapi jika kamu tidak mengimani dan kamu tidak memandangnya sebagai hujjah maka aku akan menjawab pertanyaanmu dengan sesuatu yang biasa kami katakan kepada orang yang menyelisihi islam
5986589 sesungguhnya allah tabaraka wa taala telah menjadikan keimanan itu dengan dua anggota badan yaitu hati dan lisan tidak dengan salah satunya dan yang demikian itu telah di sebutkan dalam kitab allah dan hadits rasulullah saw diantaranya adalah
5986590 dan apabila mereka mendengarkan apa yang diturunkan kepada rasul muhammad kamu lihat mata mereka mencucurkan air mata disebabkan kebenaran yang telah mereka ketahui dari kitab kitab mereka sendiri seraya berkata
5986591 akan keluar dari neraka orang yang mengatakan laa ilaaha illallaah
5986592 engkau menciptakan aku dari api sedang dia engkau ciptakan dari tanah
5986593 ya tuhanku kalau begitu maka beri tangguhlah kepadaku sampai hari manusia dibangkitkan
5986594 karena engkau telah menghukum saya tersesat saya benar benar akan menghalang halangi mereka dari jalan engkau yang lurus
5986595 dan mereka mengingkarinya karena kezaliman dan kesombongan mereka padahal hati mereka meyakini kebenaran nya
5986596 engkau telah mengingatkanku akan sesuatu yang terlupa aku pamit sebentar
5986597 apa yang kalian katakan jika ada sebuah kapal yang penuh dengan muatan barang di tengah lautan ia dikelilingi oleh ombak besar yang saling bertabrakan dan diterjang oleh angin yang sangat kencang akan tetapi kapal tersebut dapat berlayar dengan sangat tenang menuju tempat tujuan tanpa adanya goncangan sedikitpun sedangkan di atas kapal tersebut tidak ada seorang nahkodapun didalamnya apakah hal tersebut masuk akal
5986598 tidak sesungguhnya kejadian tersebut sama sekali tidak dapat diterima oleh akal
5986599 begitukah subhaanallah kalian mengingkari adanya sebuah kapal yang dapat berjalan dengan tenang tanpa nahkoda sedangkan kalian meyakini bahwasanya alam semesta yang penuh dengan lautan luas gugusan bintang yang selalu beredar burung burung yang selalu bertashbih dan berbagai macam binatang ada tercipta dengan sendirinya tanpa ada sang pencipta yang menciptakan dan mengatur semua itu celakalah kalian
5986600 semoga allah merahmatimu wahai abu hanifah dan semoga dia menghapus dosa dosamu sebagai balasan dari apa yang pernah engkau lakukan sesungguhnya engkau tidak pernah berbuka sejak tiga puluh tahun dan tidak pernah tidur sejak empat puluh tahun dan sungguh engkau telah membikin susah ulama setelahmu karena harus mencontoh dan meniru perilakumu
5986601 kutangisi zaid ku tak tahu apa yang telah terjadi dapatkah ia diharapkan hidup atau telah mati demi ailah ku tak tahu sungguh aku hanya bertanya apakah di lembah ia celaka atau di bukit ia binasa di kala matahari terbit ku terkenang padanya biia surya terbenam ingatan kembali menjelma tiupan angin yang membangkitlkan kerinduan pula wahai alangkah lamanya duka nestapa diriku jadi merana
5986602 wahai ibnu abdil mutthalib wahai putera dari pemimpin kaumnya anda termasuk penduduk tanah suci yang biasa membebaskan orang tertindas yang suka memberi makanan para tawanan kami datang ini kepada anda hendak meminta anak kami sudilah kiranya menyerahkananak itu kepada kami dan bermurah hatilah menerima uang tebusannya seberapa adanya
5986603 panggillah zaid itu ke sini suruh ia memilih sendiri seandainya dia memilih anda maka akan saya kembalikan kepada anda tanpa tebusan sebaliknya jika ia memilihku maka demi allah aku tak hendak menerima tebusan dan tak akan menyerahkan orang yang telah memilihku
5986604 benar benar anda telah menyadarkan kami dan anda beri pula keinsafan di balik kesadaran itu
5986605 tak ada orang pilihanku kecuali anda andalah ayah dan andalah pamanku
5986606 saksikan oleh halian semua bahwa mulai saat ini zaid adalah anakku yang akan menjadi ahli warisku dan aku jadi ahli warisnya
5986607 setiap rasulullah mengirimkan suatu pasukan yang disertai oleh zaid pastilah ia yang selalu diangkat nabi jadi pemimpinnya seandainya ia masih hidup sesudah rasul tentulah ia akan diangkatnya sebagai khalifah
5986608 sesungguhnya semulia mulia kalian di sisi allah ialah yang paling taqwa
5986609 setiap nabi mengirimkan zaid dalam suatu pasukan pasti ia yang diangkat jadi pemimpinnya
5986610 kalian harus tunduk kepada zaid bin haritsah sebagai pimpinan seandainya ia gugur pimpinan dipegang oleh jafar bin abi thalib dan seandainya jafar gugur pula maka tempatnya diisi oleh abdullah bin rawahah
5986611 sesungguhnya allah telak membeli jiwa dan harta orang orang mu inin dengan surga sebagai imbalannya q s 9 at taubah 111

5986619 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
5986620 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
5986621 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
5986622 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
5986623 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
5986624 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
5986625 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
5986626 we teach our children that violence is wrong yet corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems
5986627 it perpetuates a cycle of child abuse it teaches children to hit someone smaller and weaker when angry

5986639 over the years every time there is a major election we have had people attempt to put up a listing we catch them very quickly
5986640 when we see these listings we definitely take them down
5986641 its possible that someone would put a listing up its possible to be up for a couple of hours before we catch it its possible that for a brief period of time something might actually be visible on the site
5986642 we are very clear if you engage in illegal activity on our site we absolutely will share information with law enforcement we provide testimony in court
5986643 and what this person was proposing was probably not so feasible unrealistic
5986644 i dont think it will happen more and more as the elections are approaching
5986645 its not anything thats widespread or cause for concern in any way
5986646 people are just looking for an audience they are really using that listing as an opportunity to put their opinion on there
5986647 we have had instances that would be similar in nature where we have sports fan who are really unhappy with the performance of their favorite team and they may try to list the coach for sale as a way to express their unhappiness with the performance of their team

5986735 hal itu tercermin dari kurangnya dana yang dianggarkan untuk persoalan kependudukan seperti keluarga berencana selain itu baru 90 persen pemerintah kabupaten kota yang sudah membentuk badan yang mengurus program keluarga berencana
5986736 sudah ada wasit yaitu menteri dalam negeri yang akan menyemprit kalau ada pemerintah kabupaten kota yang melanggar koridor itu
5986737 kalau belum sesuai dengan pp nomor 41 2007 dan belum membentuk badan khusus keluarga berencana maka ya daerah te rsebut tidak akan diberi dana alokasi khusus tersebut

5986739 kalau sekarang peternak di kelurahan kuningan timur tinggal 20 orang sedangkan lainnya sudah direlokasi ke daerah pondok terong depok mereka direlokasi sebab lahan yang biasanya digunakan beternak sapi perah dibeli oleh pihak pengembang mega kuningan untuk kemudian ditempati gedung bertingkat
5986740 sebenarnya sih sama cuma lahan mereka sudah masuk kawasan proyek sedang di sini masih belum pada saat itu tapi kemungkinan dua atau tiga tahun lagi bisa saja kita yang kena giliran relokasi sebab negosiasi harga masih terus ditawarkan oleh pihak pengembang mega kuningan
5986741 sampai saat ini pengembang masih mematok angka tertinggi 10 juta rupiah untuk tiap meternya tapi kita mau pindah bila mereka bersedia menghargai 17 juta tiap meternya
5986742 mungkin sudah atau belum sepenuhnya tetapi yang saya rasakan lipi telah berjalan dalam koridornya meski belum sepesat yang kita harapkan
5986743 siklus tak berujung ini seperti lingkaran setan yang tiada habis habisnya makin membuat negara miskin terpuruk
5986744 pemberian dana dari negara negara maju lewat lembaga dunia hanya akan membuat negara miskin makin tergantung kepada negara kuat sehingga negara miskin akan jadi makin sakit dan lemah

5986754 hanya empat parpol diantaranya saja yang sebetulnya bisa ikut pemilu itu pun karena mahkamah konstitusi baru baru ini telah meloloskan keempat parpol tersebut untuk ikut pemilu
5986755 sepanjang yang kami ketahui kedua parpol itu tak ikut mendaftarkan calegnya karena belum siap dengan caleg calegnya sendiri
5986756 jumlah caleg terkecil ditemukan pada partai merdeka dan partai indonesia sejahtera kedua parpol itu hanya mengajukan enam caleg
5986757 karena pada kenyataannya hanya empat anggota dari kubu kami yang akhirnya diloloskan untuk mendaftar sebagai caleg
5986758 silahkan klarifikasi masalah ini ke plh ketua dpc karena ini diluar kewenangan kami
5986759 kita harus memperketat lagi program tinju amatir agar empat tahun mendatang hasilnya akan jauh lebih baik
5986760 saat ini semua masalah bermuara kepada uang para petinju sekarang hanya berpikir soal uang makanya ada manipulasi saat para petinju tersebut disuruh bertanding dan kemudian pindah ke tinju profesional meraih medali emas menjadi tidak ada artinya
5986761 para manajer sebenarnya tidak ingin para petinju tersebut meraih medali emas karena prestasi ini justru dapat menaikkan harga mereka di tinju pro
5986762 pada masa lalu tayangan tinju amtir selalu disiarkan televisi pada akhir pekan di as
5986763 tayangan ini mengilhami anda untuk bertinju tinju amatir mengajari cara bertinju yang benar coba perhatikan tinju pro saat ini para petinju tersebut tidak mengerti bertinju dengan gaya yang berbeda

5986767 low morale pervaded among the officers and men but we explained the situation to them and we would do our best to convince higher authorities to reinstate them to office
5986768 maybe they know something which they refuse to reveal because there could be pressures for them not to talk or they are afraid to let down their colleagues but maybe they will decide to talk when they are in another place
5986769 it would correct the culture in the organization of protecting other officers and men
5986770 our obligation is to the organization not to our colleagues or friends we should not condone any wrongdoing
5986771 what were they doing all the time that the shabu laboratory was operating why did it take a sanitary inspection team created by the mayor to find out about it
5986772 we are obviously committed to an open dialogue and if thats the approach they feel they need to take were happy to continue to dialogue

5986775 my two cents worth on the mindanao situation is that no matter what happens the government must always pursue a policy of a peace process
5986776 an all out war can be very hurtful its easy to say all out war kasi hindi naman tayo masasaktan we wont be hurt we are in manila hindi naman ito pelikula e this isnt a movie
5986777 dapat actually a good government must always promote peace a good head of the government or head of the family must promote peace within his family or within his or her jurisdiction
5986778 of course when you promote peace that doesnt mean that you are not protecting your people anymore siyempre of course you promote peace but at the same time you have the same level or even a greater level of protecting your people
5986779 in the light of whats been happening the past few days which is just unfortunate then i think yes details must be reviewed
5986780 but for me they should not abandon the policy of wanting to have peace

5986790 there are reports of bookies a scheme where bets below p10 are not being remitted to stl and are instead being drawn outside
5986791 stl is a national project and it would take only a national level intervention to stop it
5986792 there is no economic benefit if we get involved in jueteng we are the legal operators of stl we operate in the open we are in the mainstream we are legitimate business people
5986793 also there are big risks our license could be revoked and that cannot be not commensurate to any gain if there is
5986794 we are doing our part to coordinate with proper authorities but for now we cannot just stop stl draws in the province since they are legitimate
5986795 we are saddened by the tactics used by deceitful people to drag salceda into their controversy

5986805 i thought it the suspension was pretty harsh but im pretty happy with the way he has been training
5986806 hes an imposing figure and not too many blokes like to run straight at him his presence in the line up is a huge boost to the players around him
5986807 its going to be a tough game they are coming off a loss and they are always hard to beat there and the game is just as crucial to them as it is to us
5986808 they come with big game experience they are all players in internationals and state of origin so you hope they bring that sort of attitude

5986827 all the efforts of the human mind cannot exhaust the essence of a single fly
5986828 the sole way to overcome an adversary of divine truth is from the authority of scripture
5986829 reason contains certain likenesses of what belongs to faith and certain preambles to it as nature is a preamble to grace
5986830 in god there is pure truth with which no falsity or deception can be mingled
5986831 if the only way open to us for the knowledge of god were solely that of reason the human race would remain in the blackest shadows of ignorance

5986844 i watched my mother have a mastectomy and then i watched her go through two years of chemotherapy and eight surgeries and a hysterectomy ive watched this woman survive so for me there was always that sense i was going to be okay no matter what

5986849 adalah umar ibn abdul aziz seorang yang bagus postur dan akhlaknya banyak ilmu ahli jiwa banyak takut dan taubatnya
5986850 aku memuji umar ibn abdul aziz dengan syair pada saat ia menjadi gubernur di madinah lalu ia menyuruh untuk memberiku lima belas unta betina dari unta unta pilihan tatkala unta unta itu sudah berada di hadapanku aku memperhatikanya pemandangannya membuatku tercengang aku takut berjalan sendiri membawa mereka di antara lereng lereng pegunungan karena khawatir terjadi sesuatu dengan mereka sementara untuk menjualnya aku tidak menginginkannya di saat aku dalam keadaan seperti itu kawan kawan sejawat mendatangi kami karena hendak melakukan perjalanan menuju ke negeri kami di najd aku meminta mereka untuk menemaniku mereka berkata selamat datang untukmu dan kami akan berangkat malam ini persiapkan dirimu untuk keluar bersama kami aku lalu menemui umar ibn abdul aziz untuk mengucapkan selamat tinggal di majlisnya kutemui ada dua orang syaikh tokoh terpandang bersamanya aku tidak mengenali mereka berdua ketika aku hendak berpaling umar menoleh kepadaku dan berkata wahai dukain sesungguhnya aku memiliki jiwa yang ambisius bila kamu mengetahui bahwa aku telah mencapai sesuatu yang lebih tinggi daripada apa yang aku capai sekarang maka datanglah kepadaku aku akan mengimbali jasamu itu aku berkata persaksikanlah untukku akan hal itu wahai amir umar bin abdul aziz aku mempersaksikan allah taala akan hal itu kata umar dan siapa yang menjadi saksi dari makhluk nya tanyaku ia menjawab kedua orang syaikh ini aku mendekati salah satu dari keduanya dan berkata dengan ayah dan ibuku sebagai tebusanmu katakan kepadaku siapa namamu agar aku dapat mengenalimu salim ibn abdullah ibn umar ibn al khaththab jawabnya aku menoleh ke arah amir dan berkata aku mujur mendapatkan saksi terpercaya ini kemudian aku memandang kepada syaikh yang lain seraya berkata dan siapakah engkau aku jadikan diriku sebagai tebusanmu ia menjawab abu yahya budak sang amir aku berkata ini saksi dari keluarganya orang dalam istana aku kemudian mengucapkan salam kepadanya dan berlalu sembari membawa unta betina ke negeri kaumku di najd allah memberikan berkah pada unta unta tadi sehingga dari keturunannya aku dapat membeli lagi onta yang lain dan budak budak hari hari pun bergulir di saat aku berada di tengah padang pasir yang menyengat di tanah yamamah najd tiba tiba seorang pembawa berita duka menyampaikan berita kematian amirul mukminin sulaiman ibn abdul malik aku bertanya kepadanya siapakah khalifah yang menggantikannya umar ibn abdul aziz jawabnya begitu mendengar jawabannya aku segera berangkat menuju negeri syam sesampainya di damaskus aku bertemu dengan jarir yang baru saja keluar dari kediaman khalifah aku menyalaminya dan berkata dari mana engkau wahai abu hazrah ia menjawab dari kediaman khalifah ia memberi orang fakir dan melarang tidak memberi para penyair pulanglah ke tempatmu itu lebih baik bagimu sesungguhnya aku memiliki kepentingan yang berbeda denganmu kataku ia berkata terserah kamulah aku bertolak hingga sampai di rumah khalifah ternyata di sana ia sedang berada di serambi rumah anak anak yatim janda janda dan orang orang yang terzhalimi telah berada di sekelilingnya saking penuh sesaknya orang yang mengelilinginya aku merasa tidak ada cara lain untuk bisa menemuinya karena itu aku mengeraskan suaraku seraya merangkai bait wahai umar berikan kebaikan dan kemuliaan wahai umar berikanlah tempayan tempayan yang besar sesungguhnya aku berasal dari kota qathan tempat suku daarim aku menagih hutang dari saudara mulia abu yahya budak sang amir memandangku begitu lama kemudian menoleh kepadanya umar seraya berkata wahai amirul mukminin sesungguhnya aku punya persaksian untuk orang badui pedalaman ini atasmu aku tahu itu kata umar kemudian umar menoleh kepadaku dan berkata mendekatlah kemari wahai dukain saat aku sudah berada di hadapannya ia membalikkan badannya ke arahku dan berkata apakah kamu ingat apa yang telah aku katakan kepadamu di madinah bahwa bila jiwaku sudah memperoleh sesuatu pastilah akan merindukaan menginginkan yang lebih tinggi darinya ya wahai amirul mukminin kataku ia menjawab kini aku telah memperoleh suatu yang tertinggi dari apa yang ada di dunia ini yaitu kerajaan maka jiwaku menginginkan sesuatu yang lebih tinggi lagi dari apa yang ada di akhirat yaitu surga dan berjalan menuju kemenangan dengan memperoleh keridhaan allah awj apabila para raja menjadikan kekuasaannya sebagai jalan untuk sampai kepada izzah kemuliaan dunia maka sungguh aku akan menjadikannya jalan untuk sampai kepada izzah akhirat kemudian ia berkata wahai dukain sesunggunya aku demi allah tidak pernah mengambil sepeserpun dari harta kaum muslimin satu dirham atau pun satu dinar semenjak aku menjabat urusan ini dan sesungguhnya aku hanya memiliki seribu dirham saja maka ambillah separuhnya sedangkan separuhnya lagi sisakan untukku aku lalu mengambil harta yang ia berikan kepadaku dan demi allah aku tidak pernah melihat yang lebih besar berkahnya daripadanya
5986851 ketika suatu hari umar ibn abdul aziz berkeliling di pasar pasar himsh untuk mengontrol aktifitas perdagangan dan mengetahui harga harga
5986852 tuanku abdullah ibn ayyasy mengutusku dari madinah ke damaskus untuk bertemu amirul mukminin umar ibn abdul aziz guna menyelesaikan beberapa urusannya
5986853 seluruh riwayat menunjukkan bahwa imam dilahirkan di kota ghaza lalu dibawa ke asqalan lalu dibawa ke mekkah

5986859 we certainly arent out to send the bluegrass world spinning sideways
5986860 we just both happen to be big fans of classic duet acts such as the louvin and everly brothers
5986861 our goal was to channel their sound into these new songs with stark arrangements that make the melodies harmonies and stories the focal points of our presentation
5986862 in april of 06 just after we finished up recording vals bluegrass gospel album wash away your troubles she had to undergo vocal surgery
5986863 later that year she was healed up and singing great so we made all our plans to begin the duet record
5986864 then in february of 07 we found out she had to have a second vocal surgery
5986865 our sessions were scheduled for april at paul hopkins studio near shelbyville tennessee and valerie wanted us to go ahead so in crazy faith we did just that getting most of our music recorded without any idea if val would ever be able to talk again let alone sing
5986866 but this january less than a year after that second surgery we were back in the studio recording our vocals
5986867 it was truly a miracle and i cant begin to thank all the promoters and fans who hung in there with me during the grueling recovery process
5986868 i especially need to thank becky who im sure was nervous about her first production ever coming to fruition
5986869 i wanted to give becky this opportunity because im a big fan of her musical sensibilities so much so that several years ago i asked her to be my bandleader the logical next step was to give her a chance to direct traffic in the studio
5986870 if valerie wouldve given me a choice i know i wouldve chickened out

5986872 luckily we had the fabulous tim roberts behind the board

5986874 vanina wie geht es dir in deinem ersten jahr au erhalb der dtm
5986875 ich bin mehr als zufrieden mit meiner bisherigen saison und sehr gl cklich ich habe mich fahrerisch durch meine zeit bei audi sehr weiterentwickelt ich bin viel schneller als ich vor der dtm war fr her habe ich immer einige runden gebraucht bin ich meinen rhythmus gefunden hatte jetzt wei ich was ich machen muss um von anfang an stark zu sein
5986876 was ist der unterschied zwischen deiner jetzigen situation und der dtm
5986877 die atmosph re hier ist viel relaxter mein team ist wie eine gro e familie und alle arbeiten schon seit jahren zusammen hier sind alle zusammen ehem nner ehefrauen kinder und trotzdem ist die arbeit sehr professionell jeder wei was er zu tun hat wir starten in einem zwei jahre alten fahrzeug und k nnen deswegen nicht so schnell sein wie die aktuellen autos aber wir konnten in le mans den elften platz einfahren und holten sogar den vierten rang unter den benzinern und das sind sehr gute ergebnisse ich bin auch mit mir sehr zufrieden
5986878 hier sind alle zusammen ehem nner ehefrauen kinder und trotzdem ist die arbeit sehr professionell
5986879 allerdings ist die physische belastung in einem prototyp viel gr er als in einem dtm boliden du brauchst mehr muskeln und kraft zum gl ck ist es aber weniger hei was mich sehr freut in der dtm hatte ich probleme mit der konzentration wegen der hitze hier wegen dem hohen krafteinsatz bei meinem ersten rennen in barcelona hatte ich ganz sch ne probleme und war sehr berrascht aber ich habe mein training umgestellt und seitdem geht es besser
5986880 wie kommt es dass man im prototyop mehr kraft braucht
5986881 der wagen ist st rker die bremskraft und die beschleunigung sind h llisch dazu ist die lenkung sehr schwerg ngig
5986882 in der dtm zu fahren war eine unglaubliche erfahrung und ein gro es geschenk
5986883 oh nein auch wenn es die richtige entscheidung war zu wechseln in der dtm zu fahren war eine unglaubliche erfahrung und ein gro es geschenk auf so einem hohen level zwei jahre lang fahren zu d rfen war toll dort habe ich mein limit kennengelernt und auch viel ber mich gelernt aber langstreckenrennen liegen mir einfach mehr ich mag es das rennen mit anderen zu teilen anstatt alles alleine zu machen deswegen gef llt mir auch rallye da man da einen beifahrer hat
5986884 ja wir sind immer noch in kontakt mike sehe ich ja immer wieder und auch tom habe ich letztens getroffen ansonsten verfolge ich die dtm rennen wir jeder andere fernsehzuschauer auch
5986885 ja ich hatte eine sch nheits operation meine nase wurde gemacht
5986886 das war wie ein st ck kaugummi ich konnte es immer reindr cken es war so als h tte ich einen dauer pickel auf der nase
5986887 als er mit dem eingriff fertig war sah die nase gr er aus als vorher
5986888 vor der op sah ich einfach besser aus denn der knochenkalk hat sich durch den eingriff irgendwie aufgestaut dadurch bekam ich einen richtigen h cker auf der rechten seite meiner nase echt total asozial
5986889 dem konnte ich einfach nicht mehr vertrauen deswegen habe ich nach einem anderen arzt gesucht
5986890 er hat mir einfach meine alte nase wieder geschenkt nur ohne das knubbelchen darauf

5986912 are not and have never been after just small pieces of georgian territory
5986913 they want to demoralize my people and put them into panic
5986914 they want to not only get rid of the georgian government but get rid of all idea of georgias independence and freedom
5986915 every day that goes by after the deadline is a day that the world can see that russia is not living up to its word
5986916 with every commitment and every failure to live up to the commitment international pressure will grow
5986917 military action must cease definitively and military forces must return to their positions held prior to the outbreak of hostilities
5986918 as long as russian forces are basically occupying a large part of georgia i cannot see a nato russia council convene at whatever level
5986919 i should add that we certainly do not have the intention to close all doors in our communication with russia but the future will depend on the concrete actions from the russian side

5987275 estas instalaciones que cuentan con m s de 50 a os se encuentran deterioradas debido a su falta de mantenimiento y obsoletas por la carencia que existe para dar cobertura a las necesidades que exigen los nuevos servicios que ofrecen los sindicatos por esta raz n en otros municipios ya se est n realizando acuerdos para trasladar dichas sedes a edificios que puedan dar cabida a nuevas actividades como asistencia al trabajador aulas de formaci n profesional salas de conferencias biblioteca etc
5987276 para determinar unas nuevas condiciones urban sticas del futuro edificio hotelero se ha realizado un estudio de las edificaciones existentes en la zona por parte de los servicios t cnicos municipales con objeto de establecer unos par metros urban sticos acordes con el entorno y que permitan construir un edificio singular y representativo de nuestra ciudad por lo que se permitir una altura de bajo m s cinco plantas con una edificabilidad m xima de 6 300 metros cuadrados
5987277 facilitar t cnicamente la ejecuci n de un edificio singular en el centro de motril que albergue el nuevo hotel
5987278 es patente el d ficit en nuestra ciudad de servicios hoteleros
5987279 al no existir oferta de este tipo en la ciudad de motril principalmente por la carencia de suelo y el alto valor del mismo lo que coarta la iniciativa privada interesada en la implantaci n de hoteles
5987280 muy negativamente el acuerdo alcanzado entre las dos grandes fuerzas pol ticas de motril pp psoe para desproteger el edificio de los sindicatos y promover su cambio de clasificaci n pasando de equipamiento p blico a uso hotelero y triplicando su edificabilidad
5987281 no esta justificada la p rdida de este edificio que representa un estilo arquitect nico singular y que socialmente es la muestra de una etapa pol tica deplorable pero cuyo mantenimiento permite el sostenimiento vivo de la memoria sobre pr cticas sociales y sindicales que no deben repetirse

5987287 you called me chaos maybe its only because i have the guts to describe it when i see it present i call it by its name i dont want it around me so i call it out and ask it to leave i believe we have the right to cause it to go away to vanquish it i see you using it inserting it into music you want me to be chaos when i am not you love chaos over truth you have a decision to make a choice thats why i say unfortunate you could choose chaos all that i say here and ask of you im asking of myself as well i dont do hubris i dont believe i have the answers i simpy believe that when called chaos i must say no there is a gray area weather you acknowledge its existance or not we are in it now he asked what its name was its just gray as far as i know this is neither right nor wrong until you choose what it is for me this is the right thing to do but it remains gray as it passes ftom me to you and back again loomis bridge the abyss the fabeled myths of every people of every time had a name for this passing from one to another
5987288 i have decided years ago what i believe in now its come to the point where you have to tell me what it is you are going to decide about this that does involve me because simply i demand it from you or i must remove myself if you deny the gray area you just postpone the inecitable i pointed it out because you occupy it we all occupy it at times while we figure things out you want to claim it does not exist well it exists for me as i see you standing in it doing both things and standing for neither unlike dave i must say what it is for me if i make a change and it involves others you see my philosophy owes that to others even if it is not what they want to hear
5987289 i want to break you smash you to bits crush that thing that stands upon the gold break that bug stone that keeps the god from being free that keeps it from those who know what to do with it and where its value is needed in tis world there are so many who need so much and your heavy stone keeps it from them you are a pig a greedy man wanting it all control leadership surrender you soul to god whom you think you are whom is lost in his own importance whom is whom is whom is but a tomb

5987306 i think the formal process kicked off yesterday with the establishment of a nato georgia commission and we have taken seriously the commitments the heads of government made in april
5987307 its an important signal but there is also important substance to it
5987308 in practical terms nato is offering close cooperation with the georgian government and the georgian military that means helping the georgians build up their capacity
5987309 it means building up proper interoperability with nato proper joint training it also means ensuring the structures of cooperation are properly geared towards eventual membership so this is a route map to membership
5987310 ten years people were saying how could these countries be members of nato
5987311 they are independent countries they are not ex soviet union they are independent sovereign countries with democratic governments who have every right to make their own decisions on the basis of their own popular will
5987312 i think its right to see georgian and ukrainian membership as part of a process to build up these countries as a permanent fixture of the international landscape not just as an accident
5987313 weve definitely been excited about the growth and embrace of technology by both voters and candidates

5987315 google is attempting to expand its influence over the political process to help it achieve its commercial goals
5987316 google likes to bask in self congratulatory rhetoric claiming it has the publics interests at heart its all about accessing peoples data for targeted marketing
5987317 in this us election year what information could be more important than the candidates own words to describe their views actions and platforms
5987318 as idealistic as that sounds is as idealistic as we are it is exciting all around not just for google

5987341 it is very difficult for us to live with what has been dished out to us
5987342 all the countries have been invited after each match to put a report forward on every referee where they have got concerns
5987343 countries like england wales argentina and many others have all spent time after games submitting very mature reports that is very valuable to us
5987344 however i have yet to hear from the south africans all season there is a medium to go through and that is me but i have no sympathy for a coach that wants to go through the media rather than me
5987345 i will be meeting peter de villiers later in the month and if he has any grievances he will have a chance to bring them to me
5987346 they the referees should not be open to public enquiry just because coaches have their own agenda
5987347 captains dont have the right to question decisions but matfield was questioning almost every one and arguing
5987348 matt goddards lack of experience counted against him he should have stopped it its disturbing to see players disputing every decision they cant do that they are delaying the opposition and in a lot of cases it is done deliberately to slow the opposition down its got to be stamped out
5987349 i agree we have to be tougher we would like to see referees be a lot stronger in taking more sanctions against repeat offenders otherwise the players will say to themselves this is great we can get away with this
5987350 but the teeth the law has got is the option of a yellow or red card to sanction people that wont comply you go from a penalty to a yellow card to make sure the laws work otherwise teams will keep doing this all day

5987360 there cannot be a dividing line across europe as there was in the time of the cold war
5987361 the future of our relations with russia will depend on the concrete actions russia will take
5987362 as long as russian forces are occupying a part of georgia i cannot see a russia nato council convening
5987363 russia has made it pretty clear its not that anxious to improve co operation with nato so if nato suspends talks thats unlikely to have much leverage
5987364 the view from russia is that international law and international organizations such as nato are transient phenomena of the late 20th century

5987370 i think the contact portion of it is fine i think where again kids can get into trouble specifically with pop warner is because of the intensity of the practices the timing during the summer is a whole heat issue
5987371 its very important for coaches parent and kids to be aware that kids are much more prone to heat related illness than older athletes and so they need to be well hydrated drink a lot of water before and during and after practice
5987372 ice is always the best thing right after practice or after work outs if the muscles are sore and stretching i am not a big fan for ibuprofen for kids there are certain risks involved once in a while it is ok if its a bad day but getting into it on a regular basis i think covers up some pain you want the feed back that if something is hurting it should be evaluated
5987373 it usually manifests itself by a inflammation at the growth plates that is the weak link it doesnt interfere with their growth but that is the weak link and that is where they develop pain then they have to sit out a while

5987379 august 19 was a unique day in the life of musharraf it was his first day without power after nine years the day started with a breakfast with his family
5987380 he was relaxed because there was no hurry of going to office on time he doesnt have any office after 44 years but he has not given up he was pretty sure that he would get one soon
5987381 musharraf enjoyed songs by rafi in the evening he listened to his favourite song chal ud jaa rey panchi key aab yeh dais hoa begana after enjoying music he called a friend in the evening and told him i am here i will not run away i am not a panchi bird who will fly away from pakistan
5987382 musharraf contacted dogar through a very prominent lawyer in the first week of august 2008 musharraf wanted a stay order from the supreme court against the impeachment motion announced by the ruling coalition to oust him dogar regretted and disappointed musharraf
5987383 one friend suggested that musharraf not stay in pakistan for a while he mentioned a suicide bombing in dera ismail khan in punjab on tuesday that killed over 50 people a concerned friend told musharraf that extremists would try to harm him in pakistan and he must take extraordinary precautionary measures
5987384 as long as maulana fazlur rehman of the jamiat u ulema i islam is part of the ruling coalition no woman can become president of pakistan

5987388 he said we should get in early because then it doesnt cost as much the longer you wait to get in he said the more it will cost you and if you dont get in at all then it will be painful after november after the democrats win the majority

5987401 france is resolved to pursue the battle against terrorism for democracy and freedom the cause is just and it is to the credit of france and its armed forces to defend it
5987402 the problem is not the number of soldiers but the mission they are sent on
5987403 this loss of life is absolutely deplorable but also could be anticipated when you have forces that enter an environment where their role is counter insurgency not peacekeeping or reconstruction
5987404 this is the first time a large number of foreign soldiers have been killed in the vicinity of the capital of afghanistan
5987405 last year all the big cities like kabul and kandahar were not under threat
5987406 but this year in kandahar many big attacks have happened
5987407 the taliban announced their intentions at the end of last year to aim to make access to the capital more difficult
5987408 and its strategic purpose is that it grabs a lot more international attention than just some far flung district and it makes life more difficult for ordinary citizens as well as the logistics of the military

5987419 kim has done exceptionally well he has got a new addition to the family and he hasnt seen the child yet
5987420 he is showing a great dedication to his career and loyalty to the team by being here i know if my wife had given birth i would have been asking the manager to leave even if it was just for a day to be with my family
5987421 im pretty sure it will happen we have got an international break coming up with some qualifiers to play so hopefully he will be visiting them soon but he is getting on with his job and is doing really well
5987422 we have asked kim to play in three or four different roles in pre season and maybe we are still searching for his very best role to benefit the team
5987423 but he works hard he is good technically and he will threaten the goal as we saw on saturday in the first half an im sure he will be fine as we go along
5987424 he is a good international footballer and we are trying to bring players with that sort of experience to the club if we can
5987425 because every day in the premier league is an event every day is slightly different and we have to be ready for the big occasion
5987426 the olympics didnt go the way we all wanted and it is a real shame
5987427 ill try to make up for it in turin i know a long and very difficult season awaits me but i start out really fired up to make space for myself in this squad of champions

5987430 studies show that for long endurance athletes drinking some carbohydrates or some sugar actually helps enhance performance because it refuels the muscles
5987431 there is another reason that people exercising for longer than an hour might benefit from a sports drink and that is if you are sweating hard for a long period of time you are loosing a lot of salt in your sweat and that can start to be a problem and the other thing that sports drinks contain is sodium and electrolytes
5987432 they obviously cant do anything to replenish your muscles because theyve taken the sugar out but they are lower in calories
5987433 so if you are using a sport drink just as way to get more fluids and the flavor helps you drink more then the lower calorie options maybe helpful but again water is really the ideal beverage for most people who are working out
5987434 having some vitamins dissolved in the water is not going to make a difference in your workout
5987435 it can be a way to get some vitamins but really if you are taking a multivitamin every day you are not getting any extra benefit
5987436 the most recent studies show that having protein in a sports drink doesnt actually enhance your performance at all
5987437 the time you need protein is after your workout if you worked out very strenuously protein can help you rebuild the muscles and help you recover
5987438 we gotta get this shoveling done cant get the car out of the yard so im hoping we dont get anymore do you know anything i dont know

5987443 patients with parkinsons disease lack a sufficient amount of dopamine this brain chemical allows us to produce smooth coordinated movements like moving your arm up and down
5987444 there is rigidity which makes it very difficult for the patient to move like theyre moving in a vat of tar there is a resting tremor that is characteristic in one arm or leg
5987445 patient and outreach services from rochester general hospital the women youre about to meet offer a very personal approach to the serious problem of being uninsured
5987446 what government should be focused on is raising the incomes and the aspirations and the opportunities for the millions of people who are stuck on low incomes and that is where this government has failed not because they are bad people not because they dont have noble ambitions but because their measure which is entirely reliant on the state which is about redistribution has failed failed on their own terms
5987447 labour has failed it has created a more unfair society and i think there is a real opportunity for the
5987448 ive just found this picture on the net and i need to make up lies in order to display it
5987449 ik knikte bedacht me dat hij dat niet kon zien en gaf vervolgens in woorden aan dat ik cht wilde weten hoe het poes was
5987450 ik zal even voor u kijken de poes was misschien aangereden en was er niet goed aan toe
5987451 moest wederom op mijn lippen bijten om niet fratsie te zeggen
5987452 oh oh oh hij is dus dood oh oh oh ging het zo slecht met poes dan

5987463 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
5987464 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
5987465 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
5987466 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
5987467 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
5987468 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
5987469 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
5987470 we teach our children that violence is wrong yet corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems
5987471 it perpetuates a cycle of child abuse it teaches children to hit someone smaller and weaker when angry
5987472 this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side air bags and electronic stability control were rare

5987477 the germans killed six million jews and barely six years later you made peace with them but with us the jews refuse to make peace
5987478 torture may well be enabling future attacks false confessions and an avalanche of misinformation since 9 11 compromised prosecutions allowed other culprits to escape and sent the american military on wild goose chases
5987479 border guards concrete barriers and earthen levees not only prove inadequate but act as force multipliers producing automated bungling that transform isolated events and singular attacks into global disasters

5987510 have you lost your mind i mean how is it that you can disrespect a mans ethnicity when you know weve influenced nearly every facet of white america from our music to our style of dress not to mention your basic imitation of our sense of cool walk talk dress mannerisms we enrich your very existence all the while contributing to the gross national product through our achievements in corporate america its these conceits that comfort me when i am faced with the ignorant cowardly bitter and bigoted who have no talent no guts people like you who desecrate things they dont understand when the truth is you should say thank you and go on about your way but apparently you are incapable of doing that
5987511 i believe hes really good before the camera good yaar maybe we kapoors can give the khans a run for their money
5987512 perhaps the recent rumour linking john and mallika sherawat during their worldwide tour has left the sultry bipasha feeling insecure bipasha constantly kept calling john while he and vidya were shooting together for their upcoming film
5987513 vidya balan who claims that she is 24 years old but what the actress is forgetting is her past when she began her career in ekta kapoors hum paanch the indian television comedy that was shot in the 1990s in which she played radhika one of the five sisters while shooting for the comedy series vidya was 21 years old so is it possible that after a span of 9 years she is just 24 looks like vidya too is suffering the mallika sherawat syndrome
5987514 the sets of salaam e ishq are abuzz with rumours of the budding friendship between john abraham and vidya balan
5987515 even when the camera was not rolling vidya would talk to john with a lot of adaayein john seemed to be enjoying every bit of the attention their chemistry has to be seen to believed
5987516 the actors were shooting for a romantic scene where the shot required them to be under a dupatta the source reveals that even after nikhil advani the director called cut john and vidya remained under the chunri for one full minute
5987517 we do not know why aishwarya finally opted of the relationship but we are sure that the oberoi boy would have been much more gentlemanly than the overtly aggressive salman khan who enjoys his reputation of being a bad boy incidentally when aishwarya was informed about the said incident she just smiled like a diva and brushed it off
5987518 randeep hooda had an unexpected birthday gift last sunday thousands of prisoners of the thane central jail sang happy birthday to the actor it was most touching and most moving i cant think of a better gift i dont know of anyone else who has got this gift aint i a lucky sod

5987527 its definitely not easy to get a credential especially for an ethnic publication
5987528 so what we do is just get stories from the news wire
5987529 i have to admit that the coverage may not be through an asian american perspective
5987530 its like we have a global local press corps all in this one small group
5987531 i dont think they would even give my publication a second thought
5987532 if you dont have a big readership chances are that your publication wont get the credential priority but i feel lucky to be a part of this historic convention something that rarely happens in ethnic media
5987533 from the start this media sector is already at a disadvantage they are so under staffed and under resourced that they could not even send a reporter out of their region
5987534 the sad part is that their readers suffer when they get delayed information and to a greater extent it mutes their voices about the elections

5987564 what has he done for the country that he deserves such adulation
5987565 i cant remember what he did then but i knew marcos had done more things than him
5987566 he was a vague hero who came at the right time and marcos had him killed
5987567 if youll think about it he really did nothing for the country it just so happened that the people were fed up with the governments theatrics
5987568 heroic conduct especially as exhibited in fulfilling a high purpose or attaining a noble end
5987569 may fail in his specific value quest he may be shot in the back or die but his principled uncompromised devotion to the good represents victory in at least a moral sense because of this his life is an inspiration
5987570 i feel it most when we eat together because the food on the table is not enough

5987582 the music industry is all done for profit and not for any degree of musical feeling or sentiment
5987583 unfortunately the press distort things to such a degree that youve not got a hope of knowing what the truth is so its not something that i want to participate in or fuel any more
5987584 its probably commercial suicide what im doing but im gonna retire in january anyway
5987585 i feel like a sore thumb in a piranha pool in this industry i dont like the way its all run by rich men in their fifties who went to private school it makes me tired and it makes me feel ill and i dont want anything more to do with it

5987588 im going to make a record thats truly artistic thats artistically interesting then im going to retire and become a pedal taxi driver
5987589 i recognized that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being

5987591 i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
5987592 there can be no business as usual with russia under the present circumstances
5987593 they blame us as if there were no requirements for the georgian side in the six points
5987594 i mean the requirements to bring back their troops to the places where they are on a permanent basis
5987595 are not and have never been after just small pieces of georgian territory
5987596 they want to demoralize my people and put them into panic
5987597 they want to not only get rid of the georgian government but get rid of all idea of georgias independence and freedom
5987598 every day that goes by after the deadline is a day that the world can see that russia is not living up to its word
5987599 with every commitment and every failure to live up to the commitment international pressure will grow
5987600 military action must cease definitively and military forces must return to their positions held prior to the outbreak of hostilities
5987601 as long as russian forces are basically occupying a large part of georgia i cannot see a nato russia council convene at whatever level
5987602 i should add that we certainly do not have the intention to close all doors in our communication with russia but the future will depend on the concrete actions from the russian side

5987611 we dont know whether it was a suicide attack but the bomb went off in the compound i have initial reports of 20 dead
5987612 there are 23 confirmed dead and up to 20 wounded we have found the legs of the suspected suicide bomber
5987613 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control

5987623 weve had a long partnership it would be marvelous to see it rectified

5987625 this is definitely positive for the city and again it will be a good long term investment in public safety
5987626 it appears that people might have voted party lines more than expected
5987627 i gave it everything i could but the voters have spoken so i accept that

5987632 were moving on to the general election but we did considerably better than in 2004 when i got 34 percent of the primary vote
5987633 our polling shows that for the general election were in a statistical dead heat
5987634 im assuming the trend will continue which is looking great for me
5987635 im hoping that the voters looked at votingforjudges org and compared the relative experience ratings and endorsements and all of those kinds of things
5987636 i was kind of shocked by the numbers because i wasnt expecting it to be this way
5987637 hold on its lord apophos i have to take this call

5987644 have you ever wondered if your mechanic is charging you a fair price for your auto repair
5987645 a mechanic provides a specialized service in the local community like a doctor or dentist and people should have better information to vet their repair needs and expenses

5987660 were still looking at the results coming in we understand that people are voting with their pocketbooks

5987667 die geplante hafenanlage an der sepetiba bay in brasilien ist die ideale l sung um mit den eisenerzvorkommen aus der quadrangle region die exportm rkte zu erreichen
5987668 wie f hrt man auf einer rennstrecke die man noch nie gesehen hat nun die vorbereitungen beginnen lange vor dem event unser teammanager beat zehnder kl rt immer monate im voraus die wichtigsten details im gep ck hat er dann unter anderem eine detaillierte streckenkarte mit der wir unsere computersimulationen f ttern
5987669 als fahrer tust du alles um deine hausaufgaben vor dem ersten training fertig zu haben
5987670 da es valencia noch auf keinem computerspiel gibt helfen wir uns mit onboardkameras vom einzigen event das es bisher dort gab dem formel 3 rennen und gt open im juli wo sich schlauerweise einige gp2 fahrer eben genau deswegen angemeldet haben so lernt man wenigstens die kurvenabfolge ein wenig schneller im rennauto brauche ich dazu normalerweise etwa f nf runden
5987671 dann habe ich die bremspunkte die ideallinie die heiklen stellen dann tastest du dich zehntelsekundenweise ans limit heran das dauert noch einmal 20 runden bis zum ende des ersten freien trainings sollten sich also alle fahrer in valencia wie daheim f hlen wichtig ist vor allem die besichtigung am donnerstag geht jeder fahrer f r sich mit seinen renningenieuren den kurs ab dort wird die h he der kerbs und jeder buckel im asphalt besprochen
5987672 mit den schnellen teilen und der breiten piste ist valencia wohl am ehesten mit der strecke von melbourne zu vergleichen
5987673 das ist wichtig denn den rest des wochenendes verbringen die ingenieure nur mehr in der box und hinter dem laptop da m ssen sie wissen wovon die fahrer reden auch als ersatzfahrer tust du das nat rlich im eigenen interesse bis freitag kriegst du dann ein grundsetup und dann geht das eigentliche feintuning los mit den schnellen teilen und der breiten piste ist valencia wohl am ehesten mit der strecke von melbourne zu vergleichen und die ist ja wahrlich nicht die schlechteste f r die fahrer und die zuseher
5987674 im november 2003 bin ich ebendort zum allerersten mal in einem formel 1 auto dem jaguar gefahren daher verbindet mich mit valencia einiges die umstellung von der formel 3 mit 250 ps auf die 950 ps der formel 1 f hlte sich damals au erirdisch an

5987685 the big cache and six cores will give customers a nice bump in performance
5987686 it looks like at least from the benchmarks were seeing that six core chips offer more performance than quad cores so yes customers are going to want them what we dont know is how much power the chips consume and how much heat they will dissipate and those are key concerns but all in all this is a pretty big advance in the state of the art and all the major vendors are on board
5987687 these chips outperform anything amd has and probably win on price performance too this could cut amds share of the server market considerably
5987688 intel doesnt have to crank up chip performance right now to thwart amd
5987689 their current products handily outperform amd on server products from my own research i can tell you that x86 server customers have moved away from amd and towards intel so intel didnt need to release this stuff now to catch up to amd or to top them but theyre doing it anyway just to keep the pressure up on amd and on themselves
5987690 if software cant take advantage of it what does it buy you
5987691 you still have software partitioning issues and when you put more cores on a chip you have to run it slower or increase the power consumption budget or thermal limitations
5987692 when do i buzz it all off the downside to all this hair is that there is so much more to fall out and get everywhere
5987693 the woman at the salon where i bought a wig last week said i would know the right time and im still not ready yet
5987694 its definitely not hurting these folks its a good means to express yourself
5987695 these folks will look back over the last few years and say look at what ive come through
5987696 theres a very empowering process that goes on when cancer becomes something you can write about its not just this thing thats invaded you
5987697 the danger to the individual i suppose is that some people could expose themselves more than they maybe want to
5987698 but i think the danger is more in the potential misinformation
5987699 it really causes you in the midst of having the rug pulled out from under you to think about what you want to say and what you want people to hear
5987700 the first version was probably my own cathartic dumping out of all my own feelings
5987701 and i remember realizing i could edit it a little bit and still get out some of those feelings without overwhelming people but also letting people know it was really tough
5987702 its been great for me because when youre sick its tough to reach out to your friends individually
5987703 with this you write one message and people respond with all these really beautiful things its really uplifting
5987704 when you get cancer youve descended into a foreign country where you dont know the language and you dont know how to get around
5987705 and one of the ways you learn to do that is being able to talk to people who are members of this world
5987706 after a while you become more interested in the experience of the cancer than in the science of the cancer
5987707 you start to move past what the disease is and you start to wonder what the disease will be like
5987708 in case there were others out there who wanted to know about the experience of cancer
5987709 i realized about four or five months into it that i had become part of this greater blogging community
5987710 its not that im stuck in the past and im not willing to move on
5987711 ive just come to accept that breast cancer in some way shape or form will always be a part of my everyday life
5987712 leave no stone unturned in restoring financial health to all transportation agencies
5987713 other mbta board members have been made aware of and support this request
5987714 while recognizing these employees important contributions to the success of the ts daily operations and the fact that they have received no salary adjustments for three years the current serious financial challenges facing the mbta require the board to pursue every avenue to find cost savings
5987715 the reason they dont fire him is they cant find anybody better
5987716 this shows a cultural shift in public attitude where people understand that as a community by everyone getting health insurance we are improving the health of everybody
5987717 it shows them that its a good model for massachusetts
5987718 the intent of healthcare reform was that if people were getting coverage
5987719 that 159 000 is almost twice what was projected it translates into almost 1 billion more spent by employers on premiums

5987725 i set out to prevent an obama presidency from happening

5987729 we do think that flash is the technology being abused
5987730 because it does have a facility to put content into peoples clipboards
5987731 the attackers have somehow managed to insert malicious adverts into the system
5987732 if youre in an instant message conversation with someone and they say heres that link i was talking about youre more likely to believe its legitimate its very cunning
5987733 when i say taking over my clipboard i mean it appears on my clipboard and cant be removed
5987734 whenever i paste thats what gets pasted if i copy something else and then paste whatever i copied isnt actually copied and that string is what gets pasted
5987735 if someone replies to an mail they paste from the clipboard and get the url maybe they catch it maybe not likewise with blog posts guestbooks comments facebook etc theyre hoping that when you paste you paste their crap and it gets through
5987736 technology is a tool to address some of the worlds most pressing challenges related to health care education economic development and the environment
5987737 no nations or individuals are untouched by these issues get involved be part of the solution
5987738 it was a thoughtful piece focusing on what technology can do rather than focusing on 45 nanometre technology
5987739 intel will have plenty of opportunity to talk about products and technology he was trying to raise the level over individual products
5987740 it was certainly crafted to hit some hot button issues
5987741 this is part of a larger recognition and effort by large it vendors that they need to do more to encourage innovation around the world

5987770 das unbehagen das vor allem der westen bei dieser wendung der weltgeschichte zu empfinden scheint beruht auf der ungewissheit die der aufstieg eines solch m chtigen landes wie china f r die zukunft bringen wird der westen erblickt in china die kommende konkurrenz gegen ber korea dem politischen zwerg konnte man nachsichtig und aufmunternd sein

5987780 its a monkey its not like it did anything bad
5987781 there can be no business as usual with russia under the present circumstances
5987782 they blame us as if there were no requirements for the georgian side in the six points
5987783 i mean the requirements to bring back their troops to the places where they are on a permanent basis
5987784 are not and have never been after just small pieces of georgian territory
5987785 they want to demoralize my people and put them into panic
5987786 they want to not only get rid of the georgian government but get rid of all idea of georgias independence and freedom
5987787 every day that goes by after the deadline is a day that the world can see that russia is not living up to its word
5987788 with every commitment and every failure to live up to the commitment international pressure will grow
5987789 military action must cease definitively and military forces must return to their positions held prior to the outbreak of hostilities
5987790 as long as russian forces are basically occupying a large part of georgia i cannot see a nato russia council convene at whatever level
5987791 i should add that we certainly do not have the intention to close all doors in our communication with russia but the future will depend on the concrete actions from the russian side
5987792 full and immediate compliance with the cease fire agreement to which the parties have subscribed
5987793 they can put it to a vote if they want to
5987794 i recognized that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
5987795 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
5987796 i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
5987797 hes refusing to sign the conditions the judge imposed on him yesterday

5987802 ive seen people get bumped a lot and its just going to get worse
5987803 were experiencing capacity problems on a lot of our trains during the peak and thats going to increase
5987804 its a happy problem to have but the bike riders are not the only ones
5987805 if we build all these alternatives and theyre still lining up getting bumped from the train all the time its not solving the problem

5987811 there comes a point where to grant a further indulgence to a party who has not put their house in order is to deny the other party its rights

5987817 the important thing is that this ruling establishes key brands right to sell us the theatres and it establishes our right to buy
5987818 i have no reason to not close the sale this is a pretty strong judgment im kind of pleased because i prefer to spend my time in theatres rather than in court
5987819 i didnt have a great deal of discomfort in this i just felt that a very rich person was trying to waste a lot of money a lot of other peoples including his
5987820 the granting of the injunction would have the effect of granting dancap rights for which it did not negotiate
5987821 playing hockey you can almost tell just by looking at them that this person might be more aggressive than another person
5987822 we wanted to see the extent to which these individual differences in the face would actually be correlated with aggressive behaviour
5987823 we found that in men the facial metric that we used was correlated with how aggressive men were on this computer test
5987824 there was no such relationship in women it was only in men
5987825 we think that testosterone levels around puberty might be partly responsible for shaping the facial width to height ratio
5987826 not only would it shape the facial width to height ratio but it might shape their brains to be more aggressive
5987827 to say that we will or will not hit it its speculation
5987828 from what i saw it cant be the end of the month
5987829 that place is a mess up there right now everything is covered in soot
5987830 its very hard to know whether thats a realistic date there still remains some significant work to complete
5987831 it was a fantastic game for the neutral but not from our point view to score four away from home and not go through is very disappointing
5987832 we have shown great character against a team playing at a higher level than us we are fairly confident we can go through and anything is possible in the cup
5987833 we have come to close to great things before but we will keep on pushing we will attack more and hopefully well get a break
5987834 after we scored the late equaliser i asked falmouth if they wanted to complete the result on the day so we didnt have to travel but they said no and now we will have to go there and put a show on
5987835 but well use the four hour trip down there to talk about tactics because i think we need to change our formation from the first game
5987836 i think weve learned a bit and weve got some players coming back for the replay so hopefully we can get the victory
5987837 weve got a home tie against truro to look forward to if we can progress and even though realistically we are unlikely to beat them we should get a decent crowd and some more money as they are one of the biggest teams in the competition at this stage
5987838 on behalf of everyone at the fa id like to offer congratulations to john terry following fabio capellos decision to make him englands permanent captain

5987844 we had a chance to talk about politics we had discussions with people we normally wouldnt meet i consider that i have made seven new friends this is my first time in a non arabic country my first time with israelis the only time i have met israelis before this is at checkpoints
5987845 i am canadian and perhaps not as interesting i spent last summer in kenya working with people from different backgrounds
5987846 it is hard to create an open dialogue in a comfortable setting at home here it is neutral there is nobody from the home team oh i guess the canadians are the home team ha ha
5987847 once relationships are formed they are more easily sustained something like this is not possible back home we will go home but we will stay in touch this is not changing the reality of the region but it is a starting point i believe in chain reactions we can spread this around we have this bond
5987848 my parents have opposite views my mother said i should be careful and not say anything that might upset them my dad is more easy going he speaks a few words of arabic he wants my palestinian friend to visit
5987849 i told my friends i hiked in algonquin park with israelis and palestinians and there was no rock throwing ha ha
5987850 it should be exciting it must be artistic it must be art in space it must be something that people feels good about

5987861 were different from everything else in las vegas were a show that builds up relationships and speaks to the people personally in a way most other shows dont i knew we were going to do well i knew las vegas audiences would embrace us because we are so different

5987875 if any republican in this state thinks they can put an intervention group together to get him not to run they dont know jim gibbons
5987876 nosotros hemos expresado que queremos una explicaci n del gobierno y hemos conseguido un compromiso de tres meses de plazo y adem s el gobierno vendr a explicar
5987877 llevar a cabo esta acci n ahora nos permite centrar nuestra atenci n en localizaciones con mejor potencial a largo plazo
5987878 una de las posibles explicaciones de este comportamiento ser a un proceso de sustituci n de recursos por parte de las snf que ante las dificultades de colocar nuevas emisiones de deuda en los mercados de cr dito habr an canalizado estas necesidades financieras a trav s de pr stamos concedidos por las ifm
5987879 sin embargo este argumento resulta por s solo insuficiente para justificar el fuerte crecimiento del cr dito empresarial en los ltimos trimestres
5987880 al pedir no s lo una reestructuraci n fundamental de baa sino tambi n una revisi n por el gobierno del air transport white paper la comisi n a ade los riesgos de retrasar la construcci n de nuevas pistas y de dificultar las mejoras en el servicio al cliente
5987881 la comisi n determina que la falta de capacidad en pistas de aterrizaje es una raz n principal que induce a lo que califica como est ndares de servicio deficitarios y falta de diligencia ante incidencias con el resultado de frecuentes retrasos
5987882 err neo y sus remedios ser an desproporcionados y contraproducentes
5987883 justo cuando el gobierno debe tomar decisiones que lleven a la construcci n de las primeras nuevas pistas de aterrizaje en el sudeste de inglaterra desde la segunda guerra mundial la comisi n se arriesga a generar incertidumbre retraso y confusi n exactamente en el momento equivocado
5987884 hemos visto que hay problemas significativos de competencia en los siete aeropuertos propiedad de baa es evidente que en ellos influyen un gran n mero de factores que incluyen su carencia de sensibilidad hacia las necesidades de los pasajeros y una carencia de iniciativa en la planificaci n del aeropuerto
5987885 la progresiva normalizaci n de los mercados de cr dito y la evoluci n negativa de la actividad econ mica y la inversi n empresarial prolongar n esta tendencia en pr ximos trimestres
5987886 nos dicen que alg n d a ser posible poner el reactor en marcha pero pasan los a os y todo sigue igual
5987887 they expect me to work for free and reroute their phone calls
5987888 i dont think we can afford that type of leadership
5987889 i dont agree with john mccain changing his position but im running against dina titus
5987890 incentives for the research development and construction of renewable energy facilities
5987891 i believe that it would be more appropriate for the nevada legislature to use its political power to appeal to washington not to support the offshore drilling industry but rather to foster our own homegrown renewable energy resources
5987892 one day off at the convention is one day less to make phone calls to raise money to do everything you need to do to run the campaign
5987893 this is going to shape up to be one of the tightest if not the tightest races in the country
5987894 weve got to take advantage of every day we have
5987895 those signs are 2 feet tall elevated and hung in the middle of the lanes
5987896 the signs say look at me look at me im flashing but people will still tell us they had no idea it was a school zone when we pull them over
5987897 if school police are writing tickets it frees us up to respond to an accident on the freeway or another situation
5987898 kids shouldnt jaywalk and parents shouldnt triple park when they drop off or pick up
5987899 when children walk by themselves they emulate what their parents do
5987900 use the time to talk with your children about safety
5987901 get off your bike or whatever youre riding and wait for the crossing guard
5987902 i would love it if every middle school had a crossing guard
5987903 but i understand theres a serious budget crisis going on and metro is no exception
5987904 it appears that people might have voted party lines more than expected
5987905 i gave it everything i could but the voters have spoken so i accept that
5987906 has been an outstanding value to me as an individual
5987907 i am grateful to all who worked with me on my campaign and am grateful to the voters of the second district
5987908 we need to provide the service levels to the citizens in our district that they deserve and they expect
5987909 were committed to this levy lid lift and if it doesnt pass well run it again
5987910 i would love to see this issue resolved with them
5987911 weve had a long partnership it would be marvelous to see it rectified
5987912 i think that this is going to be a fantastic enhancement to the citys fire and ems response system
5987913 this is definitely positive for the city and again it will be a good long term investment in public safety

5987972 see what i mean only a real lady would choose tea over coffee
5987973 it seems wei just couldnt get over the coffee incident back home
5987974 master ken it is not proper for you to suddenly join in other peoples conversations when you are uninvited please do not be rude to me or to the young master
5987975 anyway mistress rika is there anything you miss from here anything at all we can probably have something shipped for you if you wish

5987996 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5987997 i seriously doubt boro fans would swap our recent histories since moving to the riverside in 1995 we have achieved five major cup finals are the only english side outside of the so called big four to have played in a european final have enjoyed successive seasons of uefa cup football won our first major trophy and enjoyed 11 consecutive years in the premier league
5987998 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5987999 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5988000 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5988001 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5988002 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5988003 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5988004 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5988005 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5988006 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5988007 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5988008 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5988009 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5988010 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5988011 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5988012 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5988013 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5988014 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5988015 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5988016 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5988017 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5988018 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5988019 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5988020 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5988021 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5988022 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5988023 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5988024 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5988025 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5988026 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5988027 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5988028 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5988029 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5988030 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5988031 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5988032 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
5988033 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
5988034 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
5988035 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
5988036 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5988037 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5988038 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5988039 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5988040 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5988041 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5988042 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5988043 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5988044 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5988045 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5988046 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5988047 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5988048 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5988049 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5988050 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5988051 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5988052 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5988053 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5988054 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5988055 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5988056 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5988057 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5988058 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5988059 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5988060 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5988061 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
5988062 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
5988063 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
5988064 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
5988065 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
5988066 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
5988067 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
5988068 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
5988069 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
5988070 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
5988071 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5988072 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5988073 monitoring data shows that indianas air quality continues to improve
5988074 will not include as many counties as todays preliminary designations
5988075 we will be submitting additional analyses to usepa to support our position
5988076 we are hopeful that usepa will carefully examine this information and respond accordingly
5988077 well want to look and see what the difference is and whether we should be more conservative and include even more counties
5988078 there are very real and serious health effects from these particles
5988079 there could be further upside but it will not be that much because of the poor economic outlook in the west
5988080 five villages have been flooded and the residents have been evacuated
5988081 we think people may have been killed but we have not been able to verify the number
5988082 five villages have been flooded and the residents have been evacuated
5988083 we were in puno for about a week and ate out for every meal while puno is not the gastronomic capital of per we had some very nice meals our favorite casa andina private collection puno we went to this restaurant twice and had two good meals its a little out of town but the taxi ride is only s 8 at most the room is lovely with 2 fireplaces and the service is quite good we shared everything and ordered a peruvian tacama chardonnay sauvignon blanc vigonier s 50 that was surprisingly good at one of our meals our starter was the raviol de ragout cordero con gelatina de menta mu a y jugos del cocci n s 30 it was one big lamb ravioli and it was delicious the reduced sauce was very good for our main dish we shared the trucha de lago en chutney de recotos y manzana sobre mini tacu tacu de pallares s 38 it was very good even though the trout was too dry for our taste the tacu tacu de pallares is a pur e of pallares which is a delicious white broad bean i really like pallares and have started to make a dip of pallares at home as an aperitivo wikipedia translates pallares as lima beans or butter beans but im not sure thats correct the chef came to our table which we love to ask us about our meal that makes a meal quite special for us for dessert we shared the caneloni rellenos de mousse de caramelo y casta a camotes confitadoes en miel y gelatina de baileys s 25 the dessert was unusual and we liked it we had one agua s 7 and one tea de mu a s 14 tea de mu a is made with a local herb that looks and tastes like oregano
5988084 house price growth was not sustainable at the levels recorded this time last year and the five per cent annual decrease in new home prices last month shows that the market has undergone a necessary period of correction
5988085 in our monthly review of the new homes market we measure stock price against demand price which shows the price developers are marketing their homes against the amount buyers indicate they are actually willing to pay
5988086 this offers a clear indication of where prices need to be during the peak in new home prices last july the gap between stock and demand prices was the biggest ever recorded suggesting that strong continued price growth was not sustainable

5988093 what the bill does is requires that if theyre going to have a pharmacy just to make sure the patients safety is protected
5988094 it requires that the prescriptions be checked by a pharmacist or a doctor before they are dispensed the patients will still be able to receive their free samples will still be able to receive prescriptions from a free clinic pharmacy and other such things they could allow doctors to dispense or try to get volunteer pharmacists if they are unable to afford to pay a pharmacist
5988095 weve also put in the regs regulations an incentive to allow pharmacists to earn some of their required continuing education credit for hours they volunteer in a free clinic
5988096 they get on the job experience working in a different environment they might not otherwise encounter
5988097 were looking at multiple routes to try and get the volunteer pharmacists for the free clinics
5988098 as long as its a valid prescription and as so long as they qualify for the clinics services then it would be like taking it to any other pharmacy
5988099 we just want the patients to have the same protections at this clinic pharmacy as if they had it filled at the hospital pharmacy or a retail pharmacy
5988100 in any other regular pharmacy hospital or retail non pharmacy personnel are generally not permitted in the pharmacy
5988101 physicians in pharmacies act as dispensing physicians under their board of medicine or board of osteopathy
5988102 its not up to the board of pharmacy its up to their particular licensing board this bill in no way affects their abilities to prescribe as is regulated by their own licensing boards
5988103 what we are seeing is a vacuum of this sort of policy
5988104 and i urge people to consider what they are doing and dont take the risk of putting in colin barnett and treasury spokesman troy buswell with their privatisation agenda and absolutely nothing to support ordinary families

5988106 my broader view about taxation is that this is meant to be a boom state people who pay tax families and small businesses in particular deserve some concessions
5988107 the head count compared from this day a year ago was plus 107 over last year which represents about a 6 percent increase we are hearing many colleges and universities in the state are noticing their enrollment is up i think one fact that probably lends itself to that is increasing cost in gasoline where many students may have took a look at some institutions that are some distance away all of a sudden with the spike in gas prices many students are now taking a second look at institutions closer to home
5988108 i think distance learning is huge no matter where you are now
5988109 we are making a good faith effort to accommodate students who want to attend concord university
5988110 staff in our office of residence life began crafting plans to accommodate an increase in students once we realized that our numbers were up the plans were put into place this summer and i have been impressed by the way the staff in residence life has worked with our business office and admissions office to ensure that those who want to attend concord have that opportunity this demand is unprecedented
5988111 but we are really not anticipating being up or down but about the same we were last fall

5988113 its not a new theme but on the other hand the track record of gms incentive programs has been very good
5988114 every public school needs effective methods of discipline but beating kids teaches violence and it doesnt stop bad behavior
5988115 corporal punishment discourages learning fails to deter future misbehavior and at times even provokes it
5988116 when you talk to local school officials they point to the fact that its quick and its effective and thats true
5988117 it doesnt take much time to administer corporal punishment and you dont have to hire someone to run a detention or an after school program
5988118 we need forms of discipline that makes children understand why what they did was wrong
5988119 teachers may have overcrowded classrooms and lack resources such as counselors to assist with particularly disruptive students or classroom dynamics
5988120 corporal punishment is not effective at the junior and senior high school levels and i do not recommend its application
5988121 it can be useful for elementary students especially with amateur clowns as opposed to hard core troublemakers for this reason i am opposed to abolishing spanking in elementary schools because we have systematically eliminated the tools with which teachers have traditionally backed up their word were now down to a precious few lets not go any further in that direction
5988122 most parents like this because it takes care of the punishment it gets the kids back in class it doesnt disrupt instruction its like the quick and dirty way of dealing with discipline problems
5988123 it works on some and it doesnt work on others
5988124 if youre one of the individuals that it does work on yes it will become a deterrent
5988125 i dont think its the schools place to make decisions like that
5988126 im not necessarily in favor of that kind of punishment in the house either but i feel like if somebody makes that decision it should be the parent
5988127 we just believe that its time for us to look at other options for our kids as opposed to corporal punishment
5988128 we think theres more effective ways most of our principals have chosen not to use it even though its been in the book were trying to create some consistency
5988129 everything indicates that the brakes failed at a curve the truck hit a wall and flipped over

5988149 its unacceptable when citizens feel they have to turn to private police who are not accountable to the public under the police services act not subject to standards of discipline and rules of professional conduct and over which there is no civilian oversight

5988178 every religious group has a major challenge on its hands from all directions
5988179 you have to wonder how do you guarantee the integrity of a religious tradition when so many people are coming or going or following ideas that dont match up
5988180 people are trained to trust only their own spiritual experience
5988181 religion is about conversion self surrender as opposed to self righteousness

5988209 you must have been aware he was under investigation no
5988210 i wasnt particularly knowledgeable about these various issues that he was involved with but as ive said before theres no doubt that i should have seen some red flags in terms of me purchasing a piece of property from him
5988211 you bought property adjacent to each other you bought land from him to expand your backyard
5988212 this was all after he had been it had been reported he was under federal investigation

5988217 we operate in a market that involves a broad range of stakeholders from various lending institutions to farmers ranchers agribusiness firms and country homeowners as well as capital markets customers so our systems need to be extremely robust and scalable

5988736 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5988737 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5988738 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5988739 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5988740 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5988741 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5988742 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5988743 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5988744 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5988745 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5988746 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5988747 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5988748 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5988749 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5988750 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5988751 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5988752 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5988753 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5988754 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5988755 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5988756 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5988757 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5988758 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5988759 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5988760 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5988761 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5988762 asemanator marilor investitori nici asiguratorii europeni nu sunt imuni la schimbarile negative ce au loc in aceste piete nu toate companiile au acelasi nivel de expunere la astfel de evenimente dar rezultatele din primul semestru arata ca scaderea valorii obligatiunilor sau deprecierea actiunilor pot avea efecte negative asupra castigurilor si capitalului
5988763 moneda nationala a urmat tendinta regionala in debutul sedintei insa este de asteptat o mica corectie ca urmare a aprecierilor din ultimele zile
5988764 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5988765 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5988766 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5988767 this is a planning took where all things are going
5988768 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5988769 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5988770 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5988771 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5988772 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5988773 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5988774 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5988775 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5988776 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5988777 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5988778 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5988779 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5988780 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5988781 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5988782 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5988783 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5988784 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5988785 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5988786 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5988787 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5988788 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5988789 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5988790 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5988791 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5988792 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5988793 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5988794 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5988795 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5988796 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5988797 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5988798 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5988799 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5988800 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5988801 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5988802 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5988803 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5988804 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5988805 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5988806 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5988807 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5988808 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5988809 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5988810 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5988811 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5988812 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5988813 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5988814 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5988815 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5988816 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5988817 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5988818 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5988819 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5988820 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5988821 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5988822 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5988823 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5988824 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5988825 i woke up to see my skylight missing and a builder staring at me through my roof i was extremely uncomfortable so went and slept on the couch
5988826 they promised to have all the work done by the time we moved in
5988827 my dad had to fly me home so i could study during study week it cost him almost 300 we are paying for a study environment that we arent getting
5988828 exploding water tanks exploding sewage pipes the waterfall tourist attraction in mackenzies
5988829 leaking roofs and jackhammer wake ups gotta love it not
5988830 try fucking waking up at 6 30 in the morning to a crane outside your window when you have an early exam that morning agh
5988831 there was also a mushroom growing out of the wall
5988832 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5988833 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5988834 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5988835 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5988836 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5988837 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5988838 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5988839 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5988840 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5988841 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
5988842 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
5988843 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
5988844 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
5988845 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
5988846 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
5988847 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5988848 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5988849 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5988850 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5988851 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5988852 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5988853 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5988854 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5988855 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5988856 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5988857 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5988858 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5988859 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5988860 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5988861 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
5988862 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
5988863 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
5988864 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
5988865 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
5988866 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
5988867 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
5988868 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
5988869 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5988870 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5988871 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
5988872 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
5988873 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
5988874 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
5988875 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
5988876 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
5988877 this could be the beginning of war if not properly handled but there is still a chance in going back to the peace as long as both parties will implement utmost restraint in order to hold back the situation
5988878 these men have committed criminal activities and they are being pursued and they must be tried in accordance with our criminal justice system
5988879 the apprehension and eventual trial of umra kato and commander bravo cannot be made as any precondition to the furtherance of the peace talks
5988880 if the government declares an all out war then we will also declare an all out war if they come and attack us then we are ready to face them we are prepared to trade fire until we are decimated
5988881 we recognize the milf leadership and we strictly follow the chain of command as long as this is in accordance to the teachings of the holoy koran otherwise we will not follow the orders of our leaders but allah
5988882 the mujahideen are so frustrated about the failed signing of the ancestral domain agreement because of the opposition of pinol cruz and lobregat
5988883 we have been saying this repeatedly even right at the beginning of the peace process that there are sectors in the milf both political and military which are against in negotiating peace with the government because their argument is the government is not sincere in finding just and lasting solution to the problems of mindanao
5988884 milf members are so frustrated with whats going on they believed that the government is insincere
5988885 me da igual cuarto que s ptimo es medalla o no medalla
5988886 mais quand est ce quon va partir ou alors quon nous donne lordre daller jusqu la mer noire
5988887 les gars on prend le char on envahit le reste du pays et on va se baigner
5988888 on manque juste de filles elles sont quand m me jolies ici
5988889 moi apr s une semaine de gori je nai quune seule envie rentrer la maison
5988890 jen ai marre de dormir tous les jours par terre dans les pines de pin dans les cailloux on na m me pas de tente
5988891 on se demande ce quon fait l depuis quon est arriv on na pas vu un seul soldat g orgien le seul face face quon a cest avec les m dias
5988892 vous les journalistes on doit vous dire non un million de fois par jour et vous revenez toujours
5988893 vous nen avez pas marre d tre ici tous les jours pourquoi vous ne partez pas
5988894 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5988895 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5988896 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5988897 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5988898 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5988899 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5988900 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5988901 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5988902 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5988903 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
5988904 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
5988905 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
5988906 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
5988907 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5988908 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5988909 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5988910 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5988911 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5988912 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5988913 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5988914 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5988915 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5988916 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5988917 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5988918 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5988919 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5988920 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5988921 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5988922 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5988923 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5988924 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5988925 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
5988926 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
5988927 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
5988928 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
5988929 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
5988930 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
5988931 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
5988932 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
5988933 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
5988934 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
5988935 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
5988936 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
5988937 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
5988938 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
5988939 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
5988940 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5988941 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5988942 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5988943 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5988944 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5988945 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5988946 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5988947 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5988948 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5988949 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5988950 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente

5988963 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5988964 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5988965 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso

5989126 you all served together and fought together and bled together under the same proud flag you did not serve a red america or a blue america you served the united states of america
5989127 i have never suggested or never will that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition
5989128 i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
5989129 he hasnt been a senator all that long so he doesnt have a long track record on veterans issues and thats what most of these guys are concerned with

5989136 he says it wont solve our problem and that its quote not real hes wrong and the american people know it
5989137 americans across our country are hurting as we all know because of the cost of energy
5989138 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families now as we prepare for the winter its time for us to be more serious about our home heating oil needs and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
5989139 we need to drill offshore and we need to do it now if i were president i would call congress back into session and tell them to get to work
5989140 why does sectarianism remain the first and last motive of the security forces
5989141 the police officers were checking a parked car this afternoon on the road when it detonated and killed all of them

5989146 right now there are russian soldiers and tanks at poti
5989147 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5989148 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5989149 hes refusing to sign the conditions the judge imposed on him yesterday
5989150 his attorney made it clear he was going to agree to the new terms
5989151 the court basically said the defendant has the option at any time to sign the conditions of release
5989152 if he does so the jail will release him if not and he chooses to remain in custody the court date will remain as previously set
5989153 we thought it was the answer to a mystery thats been going on for too long
5989154 once he perpetrated a fraud that goes into his credibility and integrity
5989155 i dont want them to leave until the job is done
5989156 we need compromise here not everyone can get stuck in their ideology
5989157 i didnt find the meeting to be helpful in fact i think it was a little unhelpful
5989158 im tired of hearing the governor ask for tax increases
5989159 its just very frustrating to hear that time and again we are not going to raise taxes period
5989160 make up for the mismanagement of the past four years
5989161 the good news about this is were able to put first time home buyers into all these reos
5989162 all the cheap stuff out there is getting scooped up by people
5989163 i think the same kind of places would have been right around 600 000 for one bedroom one bath loft condos
5989164 it was a waiting game for those to come down to my price range
5989165 values have dropped to a point where investors are coming in and buying those properties because they can get positive cash flow now
5989166 traditionally we have a little bump after labor day but weve had a bump in summertime and we have these reos coming online every day
5989167 it has very limited options and is more limited by the day which is unfortunate considering all the money they are putting into it
5989168 despite the turmoil in the industry we will complete the modernization of our airport
5989169 this is the worst financial crisis in commercial aviation history
5989170 in the future we can expect to see more airlines fail and passengers will see higher fares
5989171 it is a good economic measure and it shows that we are trying to move forward together
5989172 they tend to want to fly in and out of the same airport because it just becomes a habit there is cumulative impact on san jose that is severe
5989173 we were looking for a way to get people to change their behavior
5989174 research says that if you can get people that know you and care about you and love you to support you in a fitness program youre more likely to stick with it
5989175 they dont even know theyre doing it because theyre having so much fun
5989176 we know that eating more fruits and vegetables combined with 60 minutes of moderate activity we dont use the e word can reduce risk of heart disease stroke diabetes
5989177 its the best pill on the market but how do we motivate people to change their behavior
5989178 but when i heard about this it just lit a fire what a perfect way to do something good with this excess weight that i have
5989179 before i started i took the kids to great america and just walking from the parking lot to the gate was hard for me i was not happy
5989180 i sprung to the front gate i never once felt tired my energy level was like night and day
5989181 theres a whole set of factors that go into the ultimate cost of energy
5989182 leaving san jose anytime between 5 and 7 p m is just nuts
5989183 ive seen people get bumped a lot and its just going to get worse
5989184 were experiencing capacity problems on a lot of our trains during the peak and thats going to increase
5989185 its a happy problem to have but the bike riders are not the only ones
5989186 if we build all these alternatives and theyre still lining up getting bumped from the train all the time its not solving the problem
5989187 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
5989188 a stay at home mom who wanted to be a fashion designer someone who made all her kids halloween costumes of course that was me
5989189 shes bubbly and vocal and someone who really wanted it she had a passion and clearly a talent
5989190 i was treated like a star with my own driver and security guards who would clear the path for us by saying things like designers coming through but one thing i found out about a reality show is that its not reality at all
5989191 being asked to act surprised for four takes really qualifies more as acting doesnt it
5989192 she was hard to design for because shes very curvy
5989193 given all these matters i am satisfied that there are special circumstances
5989194 they also support a conclusion that there is no risk of flight
5989195 this is an application in which bail should be issued
5989196 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool that it has always used when it wishes to deliver a message that is its military power were determined to deny them their strategic objective
5989197 its not business as usual theyre occupying a sovereign nation
5989198 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 per cent
5989199 nato is trying to make a victim of an aggressor and whitewash a criminal regime save a collapsing regime and is taking a path to the rearmament of the current leaders in georgia
5989200 we hope that tomorrows decisions by nato will be balanced and that responsible forces in the west will give up the total cynicism that has been so evident which is pushing us back to the cold war era dmitry rogozin told reporters on monday

5989208 this submission from the dpp australias primary prosecutorial agency shows that the afp ignored the ground rules for obtaining early high level legal advice lawyer rod hodgson said
5989209 they apparently orchestrated a campaign to keep the dpp in the dark and feed snippets of misleading information for as long as possible
5989210 when the afp were running out of time they put enormous pressure on the dpp to give support for the laying of charges and even then on incomplete and misleading material mr hodgson said

5989243 is to help them return to full productive lives through work
5989244 in this case we involved the public and there was a level of anxiety there in the community
5989245 we now want to let them know weve made progress in this case we feel strongly that we have the individual involved but we are asking the public to still be on the alert
5989246 all of these incidents happened in the late evening or early morning hours of the day
5989247 ill sit here and say we have to qualify for the world cup and nothing more simple as that
5989248 ive personally learned a few things from the last campaign and ill not be talking about winning the world cup or anything like that
5989249 ive learned from talking about i want to win the euros and things like that
5989250 lets forget all that stuff lets concentrate on qualifying for the world cup in two years time it is in the hands of the players to do that
5989251 weve got the manager and the players to move forward but lets not focus on winning anything we just need to qualify for this world cup and have to concentrate on that
5989252 in the short of space of time weve had with the manager he has stressed about having less anxiety and more confidence and weve done that
5989253 he wants us to express that even more the manager wants us to play like we do for our clubs week in and week out and that is what he is trying to get across
5989254 for many years the planted area stayed the same and now it has decreased because of restrictions on planting areas but demand has continued to grow we are in a unique situation similar to agriculture because of the long term shortage of timber
5989255 that is partly because trees for timber can only be planted on steep slopes and in high rainfall areas and also because most arable land is earmarked for agricultural use
5989256 there is no recession but trade is difficult and we must cut our cloth accordingly we have seen the peak of the interest rate cycle and we have sight of the end of the inflation cycle as well so there is light at the end of the tunnel
5989257 its clear that its excessive and beyond the needs of the developer
5989258 it is completely counter to everything that made the pleasure point community what it is today
5989259 how can planners and decision makers believe a plan enforcing stricter standards guidelines and limitations will preserve the communitys unique character

5989275 the moment the lebanese government confers legitimacy on hezbollah it must understand that the entire lebanese state will be a target in the same way that all of israel is a target for hezbollah
5989276 during the second lebanese war we considered the possibility of attacking lebanons infrastructure but we never resorted to this option because we thought at the time that all the lebanese were not responsible for the hezbollah attacks
5989277 the moment hezbollah takes control of the lebanese government we will have to address the consequences
5989278 the right of lebanon its people its army and its resistance to liberate its land
5989279 during the war in lebanon we had a massive capacity that we refrained from using because we were fighting a terrorist organisation and not a state but if lebanon becomes a hezbollah state we will not be so restrained

5989311 the whole time today everyone was just yelling at me sing like kreek
5989312 watching simon win in 2000 was one of those moments that i just kind of realized that i want to be a canadian athlete and i want to be an olympic champion and i want to race at a world class level
5989313 those guys you cant help but be inspired by them
5989314 i think canadian sport just needs to latch on to those guys and really take the attitude they have what they did was amazing
5989315 coming in we knew wed be behind the ball with these guys to get some points early was a good thing but maybe we got a little excited about it and paid for it in the end
5989316 its tough to race at this level when a lot of these guys are doing 15 or 20 races a year while the canadians have done three at the end of the day these guys are just really good its the frigging olympics right
5989317 its getting better every year but were left to our own devices to make things happen

5989365 without getting into the specific details of the nicholls steyn report if you were to read that youd probably share our concerns

5989371 if the icc decide that it will take place in pakistan then it will i guess become cricket australias decision as to whether australia participates if cricket australia make the decision to send a team then and only then will it become a players decision talk of a boycott and all of those sort of things are some way off and i dont expect that it will get to that point

5989467 tiene que haber equilibrio fiscal con efectiva prestaci n de servicios a la sociedad
5989468 es un tema preocupante en la sociedad desde hace varios a os ya que hace siete a os que no se realiza entregas de viviendas masivamente ni mucho menos nuevos proyectos habitacionales
5989469 en la d cada del 90 la soluci n se daba a trav s del instituto provincial de la vivienda que entregaba un promedio de 1 000 viviendas por a o y brindaba cr ditos para la autoconstrucci n
5989470 no se entregan viviendas desde hace siete a os siendo evidente que en una sociedad que crece geom tricamente un 10 anual hace una eclosi n
5989471 si proyectamos este c lculo por un promedio de 75 000 habitantes que tenemos en cada una de las ciudades ushuaia y r o grande estamos hablando para el pr ximo a o de un crecimiento de 15 000 personas dividido por la cantidad de integrantes a raz n de cuatro por una familia tipo fueguina nos arroja una demanda de 3 600 viviendas es decir 1 800 viviendas por ciudad
5989472 es decir estamos en una situaci n compleja ya que tenemos que tener en consideraci n que hace siete a os que no se da a la sociedad soluciones habitacionales lo que genera un d ficit aproximado de 7 000 viviendas m s la proyecci n para el a o 2009 sobre esta realidad tendr amos que estar hablando de un proyecto de no menos de 8 500 viviendas
5989473 que est n construidas desde hace m s de un a o pero no tienen los servicios es decir que aparte de hablar de viviendas tenemos que hablar de infraestructura de servicios y esto hay que generarlo con recursos tenemos problemas con gas cloacas y con una cantidad de temas que hay que atenderlos debidamente am n de que podamos sentarnos a debatir el tema que es importante hacerlo y uno agradece que se haya puesto en marcha este consejo econ mico y social que puede ser una caja de resonancia de los problemas de nuestra sociedad pero hablemos tambi n de que no alcanza con debatirlos sino poner los recursos econ micos para solucionar la problem tica
5989474 evidentemente hubo un problema de organizaci n o de una decisi n pol tica de mostrar las casas hechas sin tener en cuenta la planta de tratamiento de aguas servidas ni la red colectora cloacal que es uno de los problemas m s graves que tiene este sector ya que en el tema del gas camuzzi dijo que no ten a problemas en conectarlo porque era factible y est dentro de las previsiones del fluido para la ciudad
5989475 lo que se tiene que hacer es invertir en la infraestructura que falta porque no tiene sentido tener a toda la gente parada esperando su casa
5989476 que deber a haber entregado unas mil viviendas por a o y no lo hizo aunque debemos tener en cuenta tambi n que hay mucha gente que est esperando su terreno desde hace muchos a os y es por eso que insisto en que no solo tenemos que reunirnos sino tambi n volcar recursos econ micos a la resoluci n del problema
5989477 y todos los otros recursos como la coparticipaci n del fonavi como el recupero de cuotas se volcaban a obras de viviendas para solucionar los problemas habitacionales justamente cuando me fui del ipv fue porque me opuse a que parte de toda esta masa de recursos para construir viviendas vaya para pagar sueldos ya que la administraci n central no aportaba fondos para la construcci n de viviendas solo al pago de sueldos lo que ya era importante pero hoy ni siquiera eso ya que se hace con recursos propios del fonavi
5989478 y cuando hablamos de este tema pueden ser soluciones privadas o p blicas y lo que el vicepresidente del btf plante que la historia siempre ha prevalecido el cr dito sobre el consumo y no el cr dito hipotecario tambi n es cierto que el cr dito hipotecario compromete la cartera en mucho m s tiempo en muchos m s a os pero se debe implementar una pol tica adecuada para tierra del fuego porque tambi n convengamos que las obras y la construcci n son los mejores distribuidores de riqueza
5989479 esa construcci n traer una distribuci n y una activaci n del consumo que va a permitir que le ingresen recursos al estado
5989480 si a este panorama le a adimos que salimos a buscar un pr stamo o cr ditos por mil millones cuando la tasa media es de un 15 por ciento en el mejor de los casos y me remito a similares pedidos realizados por la naci n cuando sali a pedir dinero por bonos ya que este porcentaje de tasa es la tendencia a nivel mundial
5989481 seguramente no va a poder tomar cr ditos menor a esta tasa
5989482 y si es as por qu no se ponen a hacer las obras ya aunque no hagan mil obras se puede hacer 600
5989483 porque la situaci n es muy delicada y no estamos para tirar manteca al techo
5989484 no se si cada familia recibe buenos servicios por los 4 800 pesos que le corresponden
5989485 esto tiene que ver con un punto de equilibrio fiscal y ste a su vez estar subordinado a los servicios que debe prestar el estado en materia de educaci n salud seguridad justicia y las obras estructurales de la provincia el estado no se cre por s solo sino que fue creado por los ciudadanos para que brinde servicios en forma equitativa pero hoy resulta que m s del 90 por ciento se va en sueldos lo nico que se hace es pagar sueldos
5989486 tiene que haber equilibrio fiscal con efectiva prestaci n de servicios a la sociedad
5989487 esto se debe a que estamos atravesando un momento muy delicado con un marco de proyecci n de la inflaci n muy importante y todos sabemos el flagelo de la inflaci n dentro de la sociedad y c mo sta contrae a toda la actividad econ mica por otro lado tenemos toda esta situaci n provincial desde principio de a o de crisis econ mica y el desequilibrio fiscal que reconocemos que viene de arrastre de varios a os y de otras gestiones de gobierno pero ahora es la oportunidad para que se tomen medidas correctivas es preferible curarse en salud para evitar males mayores o se vaya agravando la situaci n
5989488 pero en general la sociedad tiene la sensaci n de que hay un deterioro importante en distintas reas del gobierno
5989489 the children were not living in the bin but had been using it as a cubby house and the car park as a play area
5989490 docs caseworkers are assessing if there are any ongoing concerns about the welfare of the children
5989491 we have trained hard for this challenge and we are now looking forward to put our strength to the test
5989492 the knowledge that our efforts will benefit the quality of life of renal sufferers has been a determining motivator to succeed in this endeavour we encourage the public to support us by lending their solidarity with a donation to the lifecycle fund
5989493 this submission from the dpp australias primary prosecutorial agency shows that the afp ignored the ground rules for obtaining early high level legal advice lawyer rod hodgson said
5989494 they apparently orchestrated a campaign to keep the dpp in the dark and feed snippets of misleading information for as long as possible
5989495 when the afp were running out of time they put enormous pressure on the dpp to give support for the laying of charges and even then on incomplete and misleading material mr hodgson said
5989496 rising inflation and the rbis attempts to combat it through monetary tightening are leading to fears of the investment boom in india cooling off
5989497 the relentless rise in the flow of fresh capital investments reflects india incs confidence in the continuation of buoyancy in the consumption demand
5989498 it is not a very significant burden to make them cancel their fresh investment plans or stall those under implementation
5989499 our close monitoring of projects through the cmie capex service shows an acceleration in the announcement of fresh investment
5989500 given all these matters i am satisfied that there are special circumstances
5989501 they also support a conclusion that there is no risk of flight
5989502 this is an application in which bail should be issued
5989503 the meme should be how many frigging links can i cram in one post
5989504 when our american friends tell us its the middle east which is the most likely area of proliferation and nuclear chemical and biological weapons theyre not
5989505 its asia that has the most potent latent capabilities to develop nuclear chemical and biological weapons
5989506 thats because of the advance of their economies and industrial base
5989507 japan goes nuclear only if it loses confidence in the american alliance
5989508 and if japan develops a nuclear weapon china would immediately proliferate a number of ballistic missiles and warheads and whats the betting south korea would develop a nuclear weapon
5989509 youve got no arms control or disarmament agreements worth talking about
5989510 there has been some effort to make it appear it was capable of exploding but it was found to be inert
5989511 it was general in nature and referred to the item being a bomb
5989512 we are certainly appealing for members of the public to come forward if they have information in relation to the person responsible
5989513 weve also said the green energy has to be in addition to victorias existing renewable energy targets and those two commitments make it very clear that it will be additional green power that is sourced to meet the governments commitments
5989514 and i think that shows the governments credibility in ensuring the impact of this plant is minimised
5989515 every time we make a commitment to build something like this that increases emissions we are going a step backwards
5989516 the government made the decision to go ahead with it so they are not going to come up with an ees that says its not a goer it was a fait accompli
5989517 no long term or irreversible damage to the environment from the project has been identified

5989528 hay una baja en el precio del petr leo del 12 por ciento y los combustibles solo han bajado 6 por ciento o sea aqu las petroleras se est n quedando con 10 d lares por barril y como nosotros en nicaragua consumimos 27 mil barriles al d a aqu hay alguien que se est echando a la bolsa 270 mil d lares mensuales
5989529 constituye una medida para garantizar la defensa de la soberan a nacional ante la negativa de colombia de retirarse del meridiano 82 desacatando el fallo de la corte internacional de justicia de la haya
5989530 si gastan miles de millones en la guerra en irak si gastan miles de millones en el plan colombia por qu no van a tener 32 millones para mejorar la salud de los nicarag enses
5989531 el presidente zelaya nos dijo que pospusi ramos esta protesta y que l no pod a hacer nada por evitar que ortega viniera que ya estaba comprometido nos dijo que dej ramos a un lado esta solicitud nuestra porque se iba a firmar un documento muy importante
5989532 pero una cosa es el alba y otra cosa es que haya en nuestro pa s la presencia de un agresor que est demandado ante la corte interamericana de los derechos humanos
5989533 porque como le digo el problema de la violencia para nosotros es una cuesti n de principios y aceptar eso ser a fortalecer la violencia contra la mujer que se vive en nuestro pa s
5989534 nosotros no lo ignoramos lo estamos respaldando y estamos de acuerdo y estamos informando a todas nuestras afiliadas que hay que respaldar ese acuerdo porque sabemos los beneficios que va a traer a los sectores pobres especialmente a las mujeres
5989535 pero naturalmente que asumiendo nuestra responsabilidad frente al compromiso de defender los derechos humanos de las mujeres decidimos condenar la presencia del presidente de nicaragua y es un derecho que nosotras como mujeres ciudadanas solidarias con las mujeres de todo el mundo especialmente de am rica latina hemos asumido
5989536 en los medios de comunicaci n hemos estado todo el d a desde ayer lunes y hoy hablando sobre este tema que nos parece que la gente debe estar informada sobre todo las mujeres para saber de qu se trata este asunto y ahorita estamos en una reuni n de equipo para organizar a las mujeres en los barrios y definir las cosas que vamos a hacer si acaso este se or viniera
5989537 para nosotras el acto en s abuso contra zoilam rica narv ez es condenable nosotras hemos estudiado el caso lo conocemos lo que zoilam rica vivi en sus a os de infancia y es realmente condenable bajo ning n concepto nosotras aceptamos una agresi n en contra de una mujer
5989538 mire haberse cobijado con la inmunidad y haber argumentado que este caso ya prescribi me parece que no es una posici n realmente honesta justa lo que nosotros pedimos es justicia para zoilam rica a nivel internacional
5989539 a ortega se le se al del delito de violaci n cuando era candidato se solicit que se le desaforara l no neg el delito sino que se defendi diciendo que la causa ya hab a prescrito
5989540 ni nos d bamos cuenta de que ustedes van a tener elecciones por esas casualidades de la vida no estoy enterada hasta ahorita que usted me dice pero nosotros retomamos este tema porque ya es hora de decir basta de no quedarnos calladas
5989541 y por qu no va a ir ortega cu l ambiente de protesta el ambiente de una se ora que dio una declaraci n no hombre sean serios
5989542 porque una se ora disidente y renegada de la izquierda que dio una declaraci n uy uy uy pues no hay raz n siquiera para pensar si puede ir o no el presidente
5989543 te cuento r pidamente qui n es gladys lanzas era de la comisi n pol tica del partido comunista de honduras cuando se dieron las conversaciones para la incorporaci n de la izquierda hondure a a la legalidad ella se opuso a su l der hist rico rigoberto padilla y lo consideraba traidor porque estaba hablando de integraci n
5989544 despu s en el partido comunista de honduras la tuvieron que sacar por indeseable
5989545 gladys lanzas no tiene ninguna convocatoria no la conoce la derecha no la conoce nadie y porque aqu dos peri dicos lo sacaron en ocho columnas uy uy uy pues no hay que ir adem s tienen diez a os de estar con el tema
5989546 five villages have been flooded and the residents have been evacuated
5989547 we think people may have been killed but we have not been able to verify the number
5989548 this is the first time for us to register revenues in multi billion numbers we are shifting from just a medium sized to a large and global company
5989549 the companies we just acquired are still gestating we can expect full blown performance in the remaining part of the year
5989550 aggressive merger and acquisitions require a lot of fund raising activities capital is not as readily available as last year when the macro economic environment was robust
5989551 we are still selectively looking at acquisitions but it is not our number one priority anymore

5989563 the federation council is ready to recognise the independent status of south ossetia and abkhazia if that is what the people of these republics want and also if there is a corresponding decision by the russian president
5989564 sellers are realizing that theres a lot of inventory out there
5989565 and if they want to sell their house they have to price it extremely competitively
5989566 a decent amount of the selling population has their houses unrealistically listed
5989567 sellers see that they have competition now they didnt have competition before

5989573 nuevamente la dirigente del magisterio se adelanta a la agenda del gobierno federal y ante la incapacidad de la dirigencia del snte de mantener las maniobras o recomendaciones para contratar discrecionalmente a los maestros asume una pol tica de gato pardo de pedir el cambio para mantenerse en el liderazgo

5989579 its very seldom were hoping for a hurricane but we are
5989580 i know people hate drought but when youre talking about a tropical cyclone relieving drought conditions be careful what you wish for
5989581 our biggest concern is complacency jacksonville has a history of being shielded from storm systems while we dont want anyone to panic we want everyone in the area to take this storm seriously
5989582 i just came in from the fields everything is burning up

5989586 why arent people more ashamed of our current administration and what they have done and if they are ashamed why arent they outreached
5989587 kids today are very cynical they dont think its important to learn about their constitution and their constitutional rights they think its just an old dead piece of paper in the interest of future generations in the interest of our world standing which has declined significantly i urge you to uphold this resolution
5989588 this is an easy thing for me as a regular ordinary citizen to know that what this man george bush has done is wrong

5989598 there was a strong industrial representation a weak ngo presence and virtually no community presence because ngos and the average person just dont have the resources to be involved effectively
5989599 its easy for ngo representatives to sit around a table with the polluters and the multi nationals and strike a deal saying we thought it was the best thing for the people
5989600 but we are the ones who get to return to our comfortable homes our comfortable lives we dont know best

5989761 running into him in cincinnati i checked into the six flags ramada and there he was playing in the lounge thats why i called you later to make sure it was him i could only tell by his voice which is strange because i havent talked to him in twenty years
5989762 well shes pretty with reddish blond hair but not his type in my opinion
5989763 well as i said they were very good they both sang the girl played the piano and daniel played the organ with both hands and he played the bass pedals and sometimes he played the trumpet with his right hand and he played the flute and the sax and the guitar and sometimes the girl played the guitar they were amazing
5989764 i remember the girl singing the man that got away she got a standing ovation of course she sang a lot of carpenters songs and daniel sang midnight hour and he sounded just like wilson pickett he also sang kenny rogers and engelbert humperdink but when he sang new york new york he brought the house down
5989765 no there were too many people and i couldnt stay until closing time
5989766 you know we dont hear much from daniel dorothy went out to illinois when he was out there
5989767 but i really couldnt spend time with him because him and the girl were living at his dads and i didnt want to run into him
5989768 jason with your dad gone and your mother in a nursing home you can consider sterling your home any time youre in the area especially now that youre in pittsburgh its not that far away
5989769 he had problems in the army and got some kind of a discharge i dont know what you would call it but i think it was about him saying something unpatriotic
5989770 well i dont know at the time but i know that later one he studied voice with a communist
5989771 he told me one time that he played a lot of jazz around l a and san francisco and you know what that crowds like

5989777 to dear ronnie your voice is silent but your spirit lives on
5989778 i was married to a lady i dont know how she put up with me for so long i wouldnt have put up with me
5989779 music maker and a dreamer of dreams and certainly no handshaker
5989780 my dad enjoyed life to the full and enjoyed quality in everything in conversation in food in cigars in wine in dress but he didnt have a huge amount of respect for money
5989781 he only thought of it as a way to make life bearable and enjoyable
5989782 that was a testament to his relationship with people the expressions of which have been made over the last few days
5989783 i was married to a lady i dont know how she put up with me for so long i wouldnt have put up with me
5989784 she kept me alive and she kept me in so many ways she was a great one for helping the lame ducks and there wasnt a lamer one than me
5989785 he was a great entertainer and gave enormous pleasure to so many throughout this island and the other island and everywhere else throughout the world

5989787 there are a number of us who are private pilots who still get flying time in some way
5989788 we know that predator is critical to the nations defense
5989789 so its not a one way door that you go into predator and thats where you are for the rest of your career
5989790 you go down the list and everyone has a different reason for it
5989791 maybe they wanted to be closer to home yet still serve in the warfight
5989792 i fly commercially on the outside so this is the opportunity to do a mission that affects whats going on with the war every day but i still get to fly

5989794 if you are running out of a critical resource then you want enhanced resolution at the lower end of the scale
5989795 higher than the question of our duration is the question of our deserving
5989796 i think i got my peaking right im just not as strong as these guys and this is the olympics these are the best sprinters in the world and like 20 25 making the final we havent seen that before
5989797 20 29 didnt even make it in athens 20 56 made the final but the event has moved on and hopefully i can move on again over the next few years and maybe next time can make the final
5989798 yeah i expected the other three to qualify and the last place to be between me chris williams jamaica and christian and he ran a stormer i couldnt believe it
5989799 ive hammered christian during the year but he ran a great bend and hes just got better with every race i think his injury troubles are finally behind him hes finding his groove again for the first time in years
5989800 hes found it just at the wrong time for me
5989801 ive clearly improved and come on another level this has probably come a year too early but it was a good championship for me
5989802 i knew 20 25 would probably make it and it did from both heats but i just didnt have that extra gear and i was moving up a class again
5989803 generally i think i was just a touch down most of the race it was just a tiny tiny fraction but i was fifth off the bend where id hoped to be fourth maybe and then tightened up
5989804 i had a great time out there i said id enjoy every minute of it because it doesnt come around very often theres 91 000 people there but you dont really see them until you finish
5989805 yeah i suppose so because how close can you be one place but i couldnt do any more ive improved and improved this year i ran 20 3 twice here and maybe next time i can run 20 2 twice
5989806 ive tried so hard and havent made it but im the number two european here a metre off the final against the best jamaicans and americans so i cant be too disappointed
5989807 i havent messed up ive just been a metre short
5989808 it would be an incentive for anyone with solid fuel but it can also happen with open fires
5989809 i think it is important to raise that awareness but i dont have the ability to lobby parliament but it would be a great help and very important for dads memory
5989810 i am very proud of him he was to the point but he would have had a lot of compassion and time for his family
5989811 i think it is fortunate that mrs hunter dodd appeared when she did and it may have had an even worse outcome had it not been for her intervention at the time that she did
5989812 there is a possibility if the weather had been bad you might have had some material falling down the flue and causing the blockage exacerbating the situation
5989813 we want to try and de clutter that area and create a public plaza
5989814 its already a great place for people to meet and were going to remove traffic and create a much more pedestrian zone with more and better street furniture
5989815 well move the bike stands to create space and well have to figure out where to put the horse and carts taxis and bikes
5989816 its a fantastic opportunity and it could be extended to college green and westmoreland street because were digging that up as well its a great opportunity to create a pedestrian spine through the heart of the city
5989817 st stephens green cant go back exactly as it was there will be some vents on the island but theyll be disguised
5989818 a lot of the trees in place need a lot of root space and were working with the office of public works to see what species can go back in we think 44 or 45 mature trees will have to be removed
5989819 a doctor from the airport was called when they landed and he had one of those mechanical stairs driven to the door that was at least half an hour in but they wouldnt let him get on
5989820 my wife and kids were on the flight theyd been off on a holiday in malta and when the plane landed at 3 45pm i got a message from them saying theyve landed
5989821 the next thing i get another message saying everyones been told to sit down and that the crew wont let them off the plane because someone at the back of the plane might have caught something
5989822 they were waiting there for over an hour and a guy even presented himself as a doctor but was told they wouldnt let him on
5989823 nobody told the passengers anything other than the child was sick at the back of the plane and they needed to be examined
5989824 everyone was left completely in the dark even the ryanair staff at the airport didnt seem to know what was going on and i dont think they were trying to pull the wool over peoples eyes they just didnt know
5989825 the child aboard the flight was suspected of having chicken pox and the delay period was to allow staff to verify with a doctor whether the child had passed the infection period
5989826 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
5989827 someone threw a glass and next thing we knew christy had hit the deck the music stopped and a scuffle broke out
5989828 i dont know if it was intentional or not but it had some force behind it it hit him square in the head it didnt smash but he was hit with the butt of the glass he was bleeding and cut
5989829 one of our band dave riordan gave him christy first aid the guards were called and the whole thing was stopped
5989830 we dont know what happened the club were only serving drink in plastic glasses and its hard to understand why someone would do it we dont know if it was a row between two people in the crowd that just spilled out
5989831 we chose ice hockey players because there is a lot of aggressive behaviour in the games and its usually an acceptable way of performing successfully we could also measure this aggression in terms of the number of penalty minutes
5989832 together these findings suggest that the sexually dimorphic facial width to height ratio may be an honest signal of propensity for aggressive behaviour
5989833 together these findings suggest that people can make accurate inferences about others personality traits and behavioural dispositions based on certain signals conveyed by the face
5989834 we propose that the physical features that become evident around puberty are a result of differences in testosterone and that testosterone may be responsible for determining the width to height ratio
5989835 the next thing is to see if people are sensitive to these differences in width to height ratio
5989836 its phenomenal that after most of the hype has died down people are still taking the time to go on to the websites and leave a touching message
5989837 katys family and in particular jill get a lot of comfort from the comments it makes them realise they are not the only ones missing her
5989838 we hope that our installations will bring about a net cooling of the area
5989839 if the meltdown is not stopped we hope that it will at least be slowed down
5989840 if you are trying to cool a glacier wind screens are a crazy idea
5989841 these are the main factors and that is why the covers are so effective
5989842 weve got lots of sponsors if all goes well we shall go ahead with something larger
5989843 we are a big team but we have gelled very well and its been a lot of fun
5989844 we will never be able to remove boots on the ground totally but technology like that on show here will mean that fewer soldiers will be in harms way
5989845 urban environments are where wars will be fought in the future and we need to make sure that we stay ahead of our enemies weve come a long way from the use of binoculars thats for sure
5989846 one year ago we needed one or two eyes to play against china now you need three

5989894 weve also said the green energy has to be in addition to victorias existing renewable energy targets and those two commitments make it very clear that it will be additional green power that is sourced to meet the governments commitments
5989895 and i think that shows the governments credibility in ensuring the impact of this plant is minimised
5989896 every time we make a commitment to build something like this that increases emissions we are going a step backwards

5989936 but consumers continue to be saddled with high levels of personal debt with house prices expected to fall at least 10 per cent in 2008 with rising arrears repossessions and inflation the future of the uk lending markets looks bleak
5989937 we had the commitments there but we didnt have the money in hand
5989938 with the rising fuel costs and the economy being what it is those were a couple of the contributing factors

5989955 its the toughest situation a bullpen can be put in and every reliever should crave it i know i do
5989956 i made a very below average pitch to an above average hitter and i paid for it it doesnt matter how many times you get a guy out the one time you dont stinks

5989972 his experience is his hole card youre going to have to find a way to beat him because he wont beat himself he has the ability to keep you in a game he knows what hes doing to me he adds more than just taking the ball every five or six days
5989973 great the guys got a lot to offer a hall of famer
5989974 hes a lot smarter than a lot of people smarter than anyone ive ever played with as far as setting up hitters is concerned
5989975 the thing about greg he keeps everything so simple people like to make things more complicated than they need to be you learn a lot the way he approaches the game
5989976 weve had people in the ballpark his last three starts
5989977 hes pitched very well hes got a chance to give us quality every time he goes out there he know how to pitch he knows how to attack a hitter
