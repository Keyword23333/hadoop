2920006 the complexity of setting up mobile applications on many phones is a great obstacle for most people so weve worked hard to make bluewhalemail childs play to setup

2920011 we had the break since the game against and cork had shown good form coming into the game in the first 20 minutes of each half cork certainly asked a lot of questions about us but we weathered the storm and finished both halves strongly
2920012 there was no way that we or any side can dominate a game for 70 minutes or for one half every team is going to have their spell of dominance
2920013 i finished very weakly on friday and i wasnt too sure about my game at all
2920014 i wasnt very hopeful going into the weekend but once i started holing some putts i started to get more confident
2920015 and the more i got into it the better i played
2920016 this was a very different win to the open last month i was very comfortable with my game at royal birkdale
2920017 i wasnt anywhere near as confident here because i just wasnt playing as well
2920018 i wasnt really sure what was up with my game but i got stuck in there and holed some putts at the right time

2920022 in 1971 occidental petroleum was reinjecting their production waters back into the ground here in the united states and elsewhere where they were operating so they had the technology it was just more expensive to do it in peru and no one was regulating them this is environmental racism
2920023 was in the peruvian amazon for over 30 years and has left the devastation and environmental destruction in our territory were here today representing the achuar people the people that have been affected by occidental petroleums contamination
2920024 occidental petroleum 30 years ago knew what they were going they made a decision they did it deliberately they contaminated our lands they contaminated our rivers our rivers are a source of life
2920025 we demand immediate clean up we will never be quiet about what occidental petroleum has done our spiritual leaders inaudible name are dying we are furious
2920026 the rivers run black in peru because this company chose deliberately in 1971 to begin dumping and continue dumping for the next 30 years as they turned a profit on peoples lives and the lives of animals and the environment
2920027 in 1971 occidental petroleum was reinjecting their production waters back into the ground here in the united states and elsewhere where they were operating so they had the technology it was just more expensive to do it in peru and no one was regulating them this is environmental racism they believe that the lives of ecuadorian of a peruvian is less than the lives of people here
2920028 i have a hard time believing that these gentlemen over here would actually stand idly by and watch children their are dying and accept the cancer and the lead poisoning without raising their voices
2920029 i think they must just not know and they must not believe

2920033 a lot of people focus on greener cars but a lot of us arent aware of there 250 million cars on the roadways today
2920034 a lot of people say well if we focus on green fuels that will make it better what we dont know is that over half of the environmental impact of the automobile is not just in the air we breath or what its spewing out its in the manufacture and disposal fifty percent of its impact is before and after we use it so we cant just focus on fuels fuels can be better but theyre not the solution a bout 27 tons of waste is produced to create one vehicle and an average vehicle is about one and half tons so were extracting all these resources to create this new sustainable vehicle so what c i c l e is really looking at is what if we just reduced the use and the dependence of what we have now if we just slow it down if we look at sustainable fuels for trucking and buses were really focused on what we can do to reduce our reliance on the automobiles
2920035 mark leno a california assemblymember did this calculation he said if 100 000 people in a city decided to not drive for just one trip a month they would save 4 000 tons of carbon dioxide from the air now 4 000 tons is about eight million pounds and thats just 100 000 people once a month for trip and when we look at those trips too 40 of those trips nationwide are under two miles a lot of the trips that we make are just oh i want a latte i want a movie oh i gotta go to the store i gotta pick up the kids these are the big polluting trips that we can make a dent in

2920039 the signify hosted service now handles everything and just keeps running so we can get on dealing with other important issues the system is easy to use is always available and simple to deploy manage and scale
2920040 with increasing pressure and competition lawyers and other legal professionals need reliable round the clock access to client information and communications
2920041 but while most law firms recognise that simple passwords are not secure many dont want the additional hassle or dont have the resources to run an in house two factor authentication solution thats why we are finding increasing interest in our hosted services

2920046 after the intervention of our leaders across the ijaw nation on the matter between the ssg and the group we decided to let our captives brothers go and we are about now releasing them to our traditional chiefs and leaders in arogbo
2920047 like we said before the latest action of mend was far from kidnapping saga or hostage taking but we have to let our brother ssg know that the whole ijaw nation is not happy with his action of arming young ijaw men to rise against their fellow brothers in mend as this will make mess of the whole struggle

2920059 when all the guys get hits the way we did the floodgates will open
2920060 this is a good stadium for hitting but when you go 8 for 11
2920061 i think the biggest thing is weve gotten better since then from a personnel standpoint obviously having patrick willis inside that exposes the guys next to you a lot
2920062 as far as football goes hes just a leader hes got that quality about him he knows his stuff
2920063 thats going to be one of the strongest inside linebacking corps in the middle
2920064 he wasnt getting as many repetitions as i know he would like to have
2920065 he has not said anything about it he has not complained i know that anybody thats played wants to play more so i felt at this time to give him an opportunity to hook up with another team and possibly play for somebody
2920066 its always pretty fun to be able to walk the dodgers off the field
2920067 for these guys that are in contention theres nothing better than to do that they did it to us in 04
2920068 the intensity that was here in this series and the crowd you could hear them even when we came in after the eighth the sense and feel in the dugout was hey we can do this theyre fighting and thats all you can ask
2920069 its a feeling of if we dont get something started were going to find ourselves in a long september just being so far behind that were not even playing for anything
2920070 we had an opportunity to make something happen with someone in front of us right in our own yard
2920071 were going to have to reach down and reach back its how you come back
2920072 the muffed fumbles and stuff like that it got me down
2920073 i talked to a couple of people and they were like you just need to get that swagger back
2920074 when you was at utep you looked at people like i know you cant hold me i know you cant mess with me so at times i really didnt have that but now im getting it back
2920075 everythings not new to him you could tell this offseason we started talking about it right at the beginning of our organized team activity days that he looked different he just looks confident and he is stronger and bigger so that helps him as well
2920076 theres basically one goal get to the end zone to take it to the house im going to try to run my hamstring off to get the house
2920077 as soon as lezak came off that last wall i started going crazy were a team
2920078 i just tried to go out and pitch well again thats it
2920079 a four seamer i didnt get it as much inside as i wanted it and he inside outed it he stayed with it and made a good catch
2920080 his fastball had a lot of late life to it
2920081 my whole body was out of sync it seemed that my arm was dragging on every pitch
2920082 it was about the third inning that i was able to make adjustment and feel comfortable
2920083 we worked hard to win this series which would have been our first in a while but we just couldnt do it
2920084 ball down the middle of the plate was able to get it to go out of the ballpark

2920087 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2920088 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2920089 with ata associates years of accident reconstruction and product liability experience it is a natural fit to apply our knowledge to the safety training industry in the venetian middle ages a codega was hired to guide you by lantern through the dark italian streets warding off assailants and offering comfort and protection that is what codega the company intends to do guide and protect learners through challenging environments
2920090 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2920091 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2920092 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2920095 sure compared to elance or guru com there is some sort of big brother feel
2920096 this harks back to the old fashioned idea that you have to keep close tabs on your people or they will steal you blind
2920097 lots of full time on site employees spend 20 per cent of the workweek on facebook or playing computer games are they being monitored this way
2920098 its like im sitting in the cube next to you
2920099 i dont mind if you want to look over my shoulder that might save us time and energy
2920100 even with a job at tim hortons daycare would take up almost my whole paycheque
2920101 we are pleased to have arcapita as our financial sponsor for purposes of pursuing an acquisition strategy of transportation and transportation related businesses in the truck rail and marine modes of transportation
2920102 we have assembled a very strong and talented management team with extensive transportation experience and a long track record of creating value in the transportation space

2920108 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2920109 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2920110 im very satisfied with the executive order i believe that the authorities of the secretary of defense are adequately preserved in this
2920111 was that i felt that the position didnt have enough power to do the job properly
2920112 trust each other and we spent a lot of time together working through a lot of these problems to be honest i think with a different cast of characters it probably could not have been done
2920113 shall oversee and direct the implementation of the national intelligence program and execution of the national intelligence program budget
2920114 i feel really happy to have this moment again in the first half i was relaxed and swam with big strokes i knew that the last five to 10 meters would be the decisive part so in the first part i wanted to keep my energy my race went as i had planned
2920115 as much as i do not like kitijima as a human being
2920116 before the race we all new the way the french had swum in the prelims that when they added their best two guys it was going to be tight race
2920117 they had talked a lot about it and we would just rather do it in the pool
2920118 i cant even explain it it was unreal ive been a part of the two teams at the last two olympics that came out behind and i think i wanted it more than anybody not just for myself but to show that we are the nation to be beat in that relay
2920119 wir wissen dass viele kunden auch au erhalb der usa daran interessiert sind den kindle zu kaufen und dementsprechend wollen wir den kindle auch in anderen l ndern zur verf gung stellen
2920120 more than anything im relieved before the race i felt like i was going to vomit i was so nervous then as i walked out i felt this amazing sense of calm come over me more than anything i wanted to walk away with no regrets
2920121 i wait on him hand and foot his mother spoiled him and now i spoil him too
2920122 i knew that hed be a good father but not this good he is very focused he even gets up when ruby has a feed at night

2920139 she was having some trouble she just wanted to talk
2920140 our second quarter revenues grew in line with our expectations and we saw strong demand particularly for ultrasonic solutions however our expenses this quarter were higher than our original expectations due to a number of factors beyond our control these included the continued weakening of the us dollar against the israeli shekel as well as higher material costs as i had planned and discussed last quarter we have now taken a number of steps to reduce our expenses and as we move into the third quarter and beyond we expect to realize a lower expense level
2920141 looking ahead and based on our current backlog and pipeline we are on target and maintain our expectations of revenues between 25 26 million for the year we do expect to return to operating profitability and expect to reach an operating margin by year end of around 8 percent
2920142 the real estate market is going to be difficult for a couple of years it will be bad because the projects will be slower but it will be a better opportunity for people willing to invest but the valuations are more reasonable now
2920143 we have a group of people who can execute property development from a to z they will acquire land develop capability deliver projects in housing and retail formats quality and aesthetics will be a major component
2920144 india has the advantage of being vast and presents dynamic opportunities we decided to start business from zero instead of buying into existing ones
2920145 the real estate market across india is witnessing a downturn and the situation is no different in pune either where there has been at least 15 to 20 slowdown a figure equivalent to the all india statistics
2920146 in pune as compared to other cities a large number of bookings that take place are from investors that has slowed down and cancellations too increased from the investors side thereby making it one of the cities with highest number of cancellations
2920147 it cannot be quantified but a lot of cancellations took place not only in the investors but also material side
2920148 several pune based builders have however already started taking steps by not selling properties to investors
2920149 lots of announcements of new properties were made with the it and ites boom but that has not resulted in the equal number of homes being built moreover many people are playing it safe and waiting for the market to change before they invest
2920150 if the situation improves within 18 24 months it is good otherwise it could go worse unlike the earlier slowdown in the 90s the banking system does not have the ability to bail out the industry
2920151 im not going to show what i can do until tomorrow everyone is swimming scared theyre all wondering why is hansen swimming out in lane 7 i had a dream and called my brother sean to tell him that i won the gold medal from lane 2 thats where ill be in the final i won my first world championship in that lane im comfortable in that position

2920169 darling belinda i know i only saw you last night and will see you again in a few days but there is something i wanted to put in writing i want to tell you how much i love and admire you
2920170 belinda that is a great dog he spent part of the winter with me
2920171 belinda i dont know what you were talking about goofy wolfed his supper as soon as i arrived and has dragged me round the entire neighbourhood
2920172 im afraid i was misled in my first diagnosis because goofy is trying to pretend hes all right in order to come home to you its bravado he is much sicker than i originally thought you asked if it was time i think now or in the next few days it is
2920173 darling belinda i know i only saw you last night and will see you again in a few days but there is something i wanted to put in writing i want to tell you how much i love and admire you
2920174 belinda that is a great dog he spent part of the winter with me
2920175 belinda i dont know what you were talking about goofy wolfed his supper as soon as i arrived and has dragged me round the entire neighbourhood
2920176 im afraid i was misled in my first diagnosis because goofy is trying to pretend hes all right in order to come home to you its bravado he is much sicker than i originally thought you asked if it was time i think now or in the next few days it is
2920177 everyone is proud it felt great all the flags people cheering it was a great game
2920178 we sent a real strong message out there tonight hopefully we did to let people know were coming
2920179 we feel were the best team in the world and the gold medal will solidify that
2920180 so its nice that we did other things to win
2920181 i asked my teammates to explain it to me and they said the song was so difficult they dont even understand it
2920182 hey i still love my country this is basketball its not world war iii or anything
2920183 i could have gone home sat in my recliner and watched the olympics on tv like everybody else or i could come out here and take part
2920184 the decision when you put it in those terms is really pretty easy
2920185 this right here the olympics is for love love of the game love of country
2920186 you want the best athletes the best in their trade thats what the olympics are about
2920187 the olympics are about the competition and the unity and the friendship its not about arrogantly showing your medal count
2920188 i think the history with the united states and russia is what adds a little bit of gasoline to the fire
2920189 but that was a long time ago and were in a different generation now
2920190 if i have to forge the trail and take the heat thats fine
2920191 do you think you performed your fifth dive as well as you should have
2920192 it doesnt matter what event womens or mens theyre definitely beatable theyve got to know that going in and that adds extra stress as well it will be an interesting show they wont be in the middle of the line
2920193 the only thing i can do is overcome the pressure and hope the pressure can be a motivation
2920194 i think the question over whether this capability works has been settled
2920195 the question is what kind of threat how large a threat how sophisticated a threat the us faces
2920196 we provided a lot of information before it took place
2920197 it wasnt just people signing the petition with their names it was people leaving comments and full paragraphs i had a physician saying he was the director of an er and wanted to get an iphone for everyone in his department
2920198 there are just a lot of passionate people out there who wanted to have medical programs on the iphone
2920199 steven really helped drive the enthusiasm among the medical community for getting epocrates available on the iphone
2920200 we were really persistent and proactive to work with the record companies making them investors with imeem
2920201 no one has done that before in a legal way
2920202 in terms of the distribution they have a very positive platform
2920203 they have created their own network and can also attract other users from different social networking sites
2920204 imeem wont be a widely profitable model unless they have other ways to distribute their service
2920205 people came to imeem so quickly because they had the music they want but they can go other places as well
2920206 as the industry changes we are looking for more different models for growing bands
2920207 its really hard to get people to spend money on music but going to sites like imeem is a good way to learn about the band before you buy tickets
2920208 if they were promoting our artists and we would be giving them content it would make sense to have some kind of relationship with them
2920209 big brands are willing to pay higher rates to reach customers and ad rates are actually higher than people realize
2920210 over time as long as sites continue to provide value for advertisers the rates are going to be sustainable
2920211 i love ben curtis a lot and i love the fact hes made the team

2920217 for him to swim the fastest split ever thats got to excite him and then to catch the world record holder
2920218 michaels quest is completely in the hands of michael at this point
2920219 he knows when to back off in races but he gave it all he could in that 100 free
2920220 20 year old kid trapped in a 47 year old mans body
2920221 from the beginning of third day we realized that we needed to have someone to speak into our lives as individuals and as a band through the years we have had many people pastors and friends travel with us but of all those people nigel james has been the most important he has allowed us and reminded us to be men of god first and as a result our music and ministry have reflected that nigel has kept us accountable to each other to the church and of course to our lord he has helped us to grow in our faith and has reminded us to stay focused on our calling and on what third day is really all about
2920222 how did you get the job of third days road pastor
2920223 for just as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts higher than your thoughts
2920224 at another paramount theme park third day talked me into going on the top gun ride with them a frightening experience
2920225 wow these third day guys must be incredible even their guitar tech is a mighty man of god
2920226 leading a bible study with third day today supposedly didnt think newsboys bus would arrive at the venue in time got here with twenty minutes to spare washed and ate only to find all the guys in third day still asleep
2920227 for the kingdom of god is not a matter of talk but of power
2920228 but we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all surpassing power is from god and not from us
2920229 since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be destroyed let us be thankful and please god by worshiping him with holy fear and awe for our god is a consuming fire
2920230 to be a force to be reckoned with means a lot this year has just been phenomenal its just crazy
2920231 i cant believe we dont win a race in three or four weeks and were in a slump

2920233 with one less guy there are more repetitions to go around everybody has a chance to shine
2920234 its like the six flags or elitch gardens for the hockey player
2920235 its about doing it over and over the right way
2920236 the big thing with elite athletes is to continually challenge them you have to get out of the box youre never going to get better if something is easy and we make it challenging and fun
2920237 it develops your skills a lot better and gives you a better chance to compete against kids from minnesota and michigan
2920238 one indian is equal to 10 japanese ten indians are equal to 1 japanese
2920239 it was looking like sergios day and i just wanted to hang around and get some opportunities
2920240 i knew what i had to do i was playing catch up and had to take on the shots on the back nine that would mean the difference between winning or losing
2920241 im a great believer in making it your own responsibility to win or lose in a major
2920242 you know the good thing about it is i feel good out there i felt like i played good i definitely feel like i played well enough to win but unfortunately it didnt happen thats pretty much all i can ask
2920243 they deserted me then those guys were having such a good battle every hole it seemed like those guys were making something it was fun to hear and a lot of fun to play out there in a championship like this
2920244 i cant tell you whats going to happen but i know ive worked my butt off in the offseason in training camp in the organized team actitivities
2920245 i feel like i belong here i feel like this is where im supposed to be theres pressure but when youre really focused on what you have to do and the job you have to get done you dont even think about it
2920246 when theyre young and they dont have anyone to follow it is hard for them to learn
2920247 they have to be taught so a lot of it is by trial and error for them
2920248 we each only had one so theres not too much evaluation on that
2920249 but i felt good about it its just good to get the first kick out of the way in a game
2920250 this is an isolated incident that had nothing to do with anything other than what can happen in any big city around the world if it had been some other random tourist we wouldnt even know anything about it maybe
2920251 so of course she got on the plane anyway and ill be happy to have them here you know youve just got to live your life you cant live in fear or anger about what happened
2920252 bad things happen in fort wayne ind where were from every day but we still go to coney island downtown we still go get gas still go to wal mart thats how you kind of have to live your life
2920253 they have told us not to do anything like that
2920254 you know at the olympics it could be anything it could be because you guys want an interview it could be a problem with tickets or logistics or practices we didnt know not until we got our therapy done and whatnot and saw the usoc people show up and the head of usa volleyball we knew something was wrong
2920255 we had lots of questions being only a couple hours since the incident they didnt have a lot of answers thats where most of the frustration came in were trying to make decisions in the next six hours people are supposed to fly here should we tell them to come not come was it something related to usa athletes or usa volleyball or a random act of violence which we now know obviously it was
2920256 we have no reason to believe that the assailant targeted the victims as american citizens
2920257 darling belinda i know i only saw you last night and will see you again in a few days but there is something i wanted to put in writing i want to tell you how much i love and admire you

2920265 the track record of delivering on production growth has been poor
2920266 i think russia is going to do what it wants no matter what foreign investors think
2920267 people will still be investing in russia no matter what the market is just too important to be neglected
2920268 if russia had any kind of safe haven status a month ago it doesnt now
2920269 obviously its unfortunate that it had to go to this
2920270 but in reality it will probably have a minimum impact on the economic life of russia

2920364 in july 2008 we entered into an agreement with apotex to settle that litigation subject to certain conditions
2920365 the global markets are responding well to the cooling off in oil prices and there is at least no immediate fear of interest rate hikes now
2920366 with most of the results now out in japan and the united states theres a temporary easing of worries about earnings while lower oil is helping to relieve worry over inflation
2920367 but this is just temporary relief worries about financial institutions in the united states are likely to crop up again and with hedge fund results coming out next month investors will grow nervous once more
2920368 the dollar has been strengthening due to a deterioration in economic data outside of the u s coupled with low oil prices
2920369 if oil were to start creeping higher again in the absence of clear fundamentals it would raise the risk of a partial reversal of recent moves
2920370 worsening economic prospects especially for the domestic economy are persistently strong

2920372 the established authority is the first of its kind in the history of uganda prisons it is one of the reforms in the uganda prisons service brought by the 2006 prisons act
2920373 the government of uganda is committed to the disarmament exercise and promoting good governance
2920374 could you please help me explain in my local language that
2920375 when you move to the countryside people are still surviving on one meal a day i wonder where he got the figures we should not use data from the city to determine the economic growth
2920376 you dont win the tour on bread and water alone
2920377 fortunately the commission chairman has told me that they are ready for the task
2920378 they have to ensure that there are enabling laws to guide the election
2920379 the commission has no control over all the players some events that occur during an election are beyond its control
2920380 every ugandan has a role to play in the process of eliminating all sorts of conflict
2920381 your action of chairing the said national council meeting of august 1 2008 contravened sections 25 and 26 of the party constitution rendering all its transactions null and void
2920382 this election came as a surprise because it was not part of the agenda for the meeting and in conducting it many party constitutional requirements were not adhered to that is why i am hesitant to accept the results
2920383 he is very confused when the party is moving well he is not seen in the party activities and only comes in when there is controversy i dont know what his intensions are
2920384 untrained law enforcement officers cannot render effective work of enforcing compliance with the division policies
2920385 on our way to court he asked for sh20 000 to set me free
2920386 they stopped me claiming i was hawking without a permit they tried to drag me onto the pick up i made an alarm and people came to my rescue
2920387 using their political influence as division heads chairpersons ask the assistant town clerks in the divisions to employ their people as causal workers
2920388 when these people later penetrate the system they start acting as kcc staff some of them make their own uniforms
2920389 that could be one opinion but recruitment of workers is not the work of politicians assistant towns clerk are the ones concerned with the workers and their duties
2920390 we have had a number of complaints over enforcement officers our concern now is how to get rid of them
2920391 all members of parliament from zanzibar and workers from the isles in the union government should return home since they do not represent any country until it is established otherwise by the relevant authorities
2920392 budget comes with 4 5 percent tax levy hike average homeowner would pay 115 more to operate schools
2920393 we will sue the police for contravening the constitution by denying the citizens the right to demonstrate
2920394 the fuel that was left in the engine was enough to start it
2920395 we were a little late getting out and suddenly the engine stopped we opened the storage cupboard and found there was no fuel
2920396 we could have got out as far as the dock entrance with the tide going we would have been gone
2920397 i think its quite a big problem and we also have the problem that were never always sure how big it is because of under reporting not many people want to report it to police
2920398 but if you have your outboard stolen why not tell us you have your serial number we can out that on our computer and that information will be available nationally but if you dont report it well never know
2920399 onze selectie is momenteel erg krap bezet daarom hebben we vincent nodig

2920412 our online business has grown dramatically over the last 12 months
2920413 we always knew that there is a huge difference in flavour between supermarket shelf coffee and high quality freshly slow roasted coffee it seems that the increase in use of domestic coffee making equipment combined with the growth of internet shopping had driven a lot of coffee lovers to our previous online store with this in mind we commissioned the development of a new high quality website that was better able to cope with growing customer demand
2920414 we hope our online presence will develop and change over time in response to customer feedback
2920415 we currently freshly roast on demand over 25 top quality world coffees which our customers can easily purchase at the new store we also have a fledgling coffee articles section that should expand over time as well as other coffee related features
2920416 a greater awareness of quality coffee is also a factor in the growth of this business
2920417 if the legislation holds i believe we can expect two developments first there will be heightened activity in the period up to october 1st as affected homebuyers seek to lock into homes before they get sidelined and arent able to second we will see an appreciable decline in buyer activity and home sales as a result of down payment assistances elimination after october 1st buyers who could have purchased homes will have to wait or give up their search
2920418 we could see a 10 or greater decline in our already suffering housing market that potentially moves us away from a market that is recovering to one that is stinging taking this one step further i dont know how much more the broader economy could handle if a similar result took place across the united states
2920419 regardless of the side of the debate one is on the market reality is that wholesale elimination of the down payment assistance option does present a risk to the phoenix housing market its been an important enabler and i hope there is a compromise solution that congress and the president will take up before we see down payment assistance go completely away
2920420 its a great area and the building has the beauty and charm of century old brick soaring wood beam ceilings and ten foot tall industrial sized windows its got a real industrial chic flair and should fit our company culture well were close to the art galleries and restaurants and its a real dynamic urban atmosphere

2920441 the event has attracted massive publicity and as such we anticipate that the local police and security bureau will have beijing well locked down so that general security risks are likely to be mitigated and therefore not a major concern for the general public attending the events
2920442 we have recently seen a large backlash against china from various factions protesting about chinas human rights record who may well attempt to use the mass media coverage of the games to publicise their cause and attempt to disrupt the event should any such incident occur it is possible that attendees may be caught up and as such should be on the look out for anything they instinctively feel is not right or suspicious
2920443 consider the fact that such large crowds of visitors unfamiliar with beijing will attract pickpockets fraudsters and other petty criminals some popular scams to be aware of are offers of taxi services not from authorised taxi pick up points or requests to have a drink with a friendly local in order to help him improve his english skills

2920445 the objects we pick up and use in our daily lives from cameras can openers and computer keyboards to bread knives cheque books and tape measures are designed for right handed people and we left handers have to adapt and muddle along
2920446 international left handers day was launched 16 years ago by the left handers club and one of the reasons behind it is to encourage manufacturers to design left handed versions of their products in order to make our lives that bit easier
2920447 although there is a wide range of invaluable left handed products available via the left handed site we want to see far more choice on the market after all left handers make up 10 of the population so theres a big demand out there
2920448 we are seeing a lot of interest in our expanded line of eco friendly cards our selection of unique and custom designs is printed on a variety of recycled papers fsc certified papers and rainforest alliance certified stock cardsdirect is also printing this years holiday cards catalog on fsc paper as we are serious about doing our part to care for the environment
2920449 normal markets possess all four of these features clarity conviction cash and closings
2920450 today were lucky to have one even in the depths of the rtc crisis we had motivated sellers and opportunistic buyers who could find cash they closed on some unbelievable long term investments now everyone is foggy headed we have reluctant emotional sellers and buyers are acting like carrion beetles
2920451 lenders have increased pricing to the point that nothings getting done private equity groups are loaded with cash but why invest today when prices could be lower tomorrow tenants meanwhile are at a standstill retailers are scrapping plans to expand even closing stores and who wants to commit to more office space
2920452 and that can work for both lenders and developers for now theres nothing we can do about clarity but there is cash for high quality transactions and conviction is up to the individual investors who make money in this environment will be the ones who get three of the four cs theyll secure cash and because of strong conviction theyll see their deals through to closing

2920469 especially at a time like this when hugh has put in so much time and effort into getting us to this point our hearts and our thoughts and our prayers go out to their family
2920470 hes sorely missed on the sideline by the players the coaches and myself
2920471 id much rather be sitting on the bench telling him what i think he should be doing and having him say i dont think so rather than where i am right now
2920472 wed like to thank everyone who has kept our families in their thoughts and prayers throughout our difficult time
2920473 we send a special thank you to the people of beijing the people of new zealand and of course the people of america we have been lifted up by the outpouring of support and love weve received from around the world
2920474 the long list of people who have offered their assistance kind words and prayers to us has been incredible
2920475 this letter cannot do justice in acknowledging the love and support weve felt
2920476 he gave us a little bit of reassurance to move on
2920477 to try to focus on what we came here to do weve all invested so much of our lives as he has it was great to hear his voice we just have to try to trust what he says
2920478 the best thing way we can honor them at this juncture is the only thing that we can do
2920479 and thats to go out and compete every day and play hard every day and enjoy and love the game of volleyball
2920480 its going to be lousy monday evening because the moon will be almost full and will wash out all but the brightest meteors
2920481 but the perseids are the most reliable meteor shower of the year so after the moon sets it should be a nice show
2920482 what i recommend is to find a location where a building or trees are near the western horizon to help block out the bright light from the moon then youll see a little more

2920517 financial planning should be an integral part of the divorce process the earlier the financial advisor becomes involved the less likely the situation will escalate out of control
2920518 until recently the attorneys and mediators did it all themselves financial and emotional counseling along with the legal work
2920519 today attorneys understand and appreciate more than ever the value we bring to their practices
2920520 they can concentrate on the legal work and allow professional divorce financial planners to handle the complexity of providing financial solutions that work on a short term basis and long term as well
2920521 despite these cutbacks in 2008 spending the smb decision makers were actually more optimistic about their implementation of uc applications in the future
2920522 in our 2008 survey u s smbs expected higher attach rates in 2012 for six out of the eight uc applications compared with our 2007 survey results
2920523 both u s and international smbs are optimistic about their progression to the more advanced phases
2920524 these smb decision makers clearly believe in the potential value of uc applications but many are expecting their ipt and uc apps vendors to help them identify the best opportunities for realizing this potential value
2920525 give the providers what they what two physicians share ways their facilities have improved provider satisfaction
2920526 as we continue to squeeze our health care dollars trying to do more with less the next great opportunity is the enhancement streamlining and integration of the entire system through investments in information technology
2920527 internet technology will help us share important patient information with the healthcare team reduce medical errors to improve patient safety and enhance the patient experience

2920533 when we first looked into finding a web hosting service provider we were completely stumped the sheer number of web hosting service providers and available plans made it hard even for us to make a decision about which one to choose this site was made with the intent of making the whole process a lot easier for you than it was for us
2920534 part of what makes our sites so successful is the fact that we arent afraid to tell people who dont have a clue what theyre really getting out of the service
2920535 no this provider doesnt have a money back guarantee but they will refund any time for unused months of service details like that
2920536 we want people who visit the site to have an enlightening experience whether they know something about web hosting or not
2920537 we try to help people be able to make an informed decision about the web hosting service they choose
2920538 companies introducing new products in a fast paced industry need to move quickly to educate potential customers that education includes not only features and benefits but also budgetary pricing so customers can quickly understand if it is within their organizations budget prospects dont want to spend a lot of time researching a new product unless they think they can afford it echoquote gives them that budget information in seconds
2920539 echoquote helps us convert a larger percentage of casual web site visitors into solid sales leads thanks to its ease and simplicity
2920540 i am very excited about this promotion and the opportunity to help those in need
2920541 we very much appreciate the overwhelming response from our vendors desire to get involved as well we are hoping to make a significant contribution and we appreciate our key partners which are helping to make this happen

2920544 the main banks continue to dominate business banking with seven out of ten respondents indicating that their primary relationship is with them despite various measures to encourage transparency and competitiveness in business banking it seems as though smes remain a soft touch for the mainstream banks when it comes to business deposits whether you are a self employed service provider in the professions or a small enterprise the chances are that you will have surplus funds languishing in an account on a paltry interest rate with smes now under greater pressure than ever moving their business deposits to rabodirect is a quick and easy way of adding to the bottom line the alternative is to have your cash inaccessibly tied up with banks that are already profiting substantially through overdraft and current account charges this is particularly relevant at a time when the average waiting period for payment from creditors is 67 days
2920545 we are thrilled that circus circus reno has invited us to help them in their fundraising efforts
2920546 its a great program because it fills three needs at once

2920548 it really gives companies a unique way to raise thousands of dollars for a great cause weve had an overwhelming positive response from this program so far
2920549 frozen sperm banks have been available for over thirty years egg freezing and thawing has been much more technically challenging nevertheless research has progressed and various options for egg freezing and banking have now arrived
2920550 frozen eggs offer women options in deciding when they wish to conceive whether with their own eggs or with donor eggs
2920551 some women have diseases such as cancer earlier in life and must delay childbearing in addition cancer treatments can destroy eggs around the world many women have chosen to bank their eggs and or ovarian tissue for future use others have opted to use donor eggs
2920552 many of our patients who use donor eggs are only in their thirties
2920553 they are often upset because no one informed them previously that ovarian aging is a serious and common problem
2920554 freezing eggs give women and couples the time and convenience of using their eggs when they are ready to get pregnant liberated from the financial personal and ethical dilemma presented with frozen embryos
2920555 egg donation is a highly successful treatment option for women who may not be able to get pregnant with their own eggs but are still able to carry a pregnancy however the process of selecting the right womens eggs often presents challenges
2920556 patients frustrated by years of tests and failures greatly value the speed and convenience of frozen eggs and will seek the procedure in greater percentages
2920557 the subprime mortgage debacle which quickly morphed into a national homeowners crisis has also led to widespread disillusionment with the financial services industry even as american consumers have scrambled to keep ahead of plummeting real estate values and soaring energy food and health care costs the government accounting office found that in 2007 banks charged their retail customers 36 billion in fees while bankers had hoped for a stampede of unbanked into their branches what theyve actually witnessed has been a stampede out of those branches that is being led by their most desirable customers however there are kilowatt lit bright spots for banking industry bank customers may be dissatisfied with the bank branches tellers and customer service representatives but they are both energized and enthusiastic about mobile banking and their online banking experiences the challenge for banks to benchmark and implement best practices both in the u s and abroad even as bankers assess new products and go to market strategies they find the emotional and transactional disintermediation of their most profitable customers a continuing and daunting challenge as banks consider retooling their check clearing and overdraft policies the pricing of their products and mandate bank wide standards of respectful customer service to compete against the self sufficiency of the unbanked and underbanked they must carefully craft products and strategies meaningful to fully banked wounded and wary american consumers and yes even as all these challenges are on their plates bankers must monitor best in breed nonbank financial players targeting their best and most profitable customers

2920566 here i hit some of the wildest golf shots ever hit on a golf course on friday but i knew i had the ability to win if i got a chance in the end it was a lot of sheer willpower that won it
2920567 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
2920568 you have to get focused and give it a go
2920569 if a couple of things had gone differently we would have been talking differently
2920570 the good thing about it is i felt good out there i definitely feel like i played well enough to win but unfortunately it didnt happen the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
2920571 well guys lets be honest here most of you are expecting good playing time my son will be getting most of it his playing time was the main reason i signed up to be the coach
2920572 hey that paper we all signed about sportsmanship and the priority of youth sports being to teach and learn life skills well i didnt even read it i just had to sign the bottom line and i was in this is all about me having a winning season
2920573 the reason i signed up to be your coach again this year is because i recruited some new players who cares if we got them fake birth certificates i am not going to lose to coach johnson again i am going to prove to him and all the parents that i am the better coach this year its all about me
2920574 you guys are horrible come on youre making me look bad

2920577 i wanted to coach because i never got to achieve what i wanted in sports heres my chance to live my dream if you need to cheat hey im not the one wholl turn you in
2920578 ok i have to be honest with you i dont know anything about this sport but i checked it out online and im good to go
2920579 the real reason i yell at the referees is that its what the big time coaches do on tv and i think it looks pretty impressive
2920580 lets get matching shoes and gym bags so everyone will be impressed and wish they were on our team
2920581 youre kidding me right all it takes is a snow cone and youre happy again we just lost the game how can watermelon crushed ice make you feel better i want you to go over every mistake over and over again in your minds the same way i do

2920586 the problem is devs need to be really honest about the topic blaming piracy for a move to the consoles is fine if its really true but if its just an excuse to cover up a really badly made game or one that nobody had machines that ran thats just silly its easy to discount everything pirates say as justifications for theft but if someone tells you your games over priced buggy and the drm is a nightmare then its madness not to listen to them

2920682 in our earlier study areas of stress were largely located at the outer suburban mortgage belts where car dependency is high
2920683 in this study we have seen the number and geographical range of vulnerable households creep inwards as fuel costs and interest rates rise
2920684 worse the deficits in urban infrastructure and services meant the more vulnerable households had less ability to adapt to higher fuel costs by taking public transport
2920685 across australias cities public transport is bursting at the seams during peak hour which gives clear evidence people will use public transport when it becomes just too costly not to
2920686 public transport use in sydney had steadily declined between 2000 and 2005 but the sharp rise in fuel costs forced commuters onto trains between 2005 and 2007 the number of train journeys jumped by 11 million
2920687 state governments nationwide are debating measures such as underground loops and light rail which is great but will only assist inner urban residents who are already the least vulnerable in society we need to get new trains and buses into our outer suburbs
2920688 since world war ii australias cities have been planned on the presumption that cars running on low priced fuel would be the dominant means of transportation
2920689 the australian senate estimates peak oil to occur by 2030 so a broad comprehensive plan to reconstruct australian suburbs to reduce petrol reliance must begin now
2920690 the number and range of households struggling to cope was spreading inwards from the outer suburbs
2920691 i must have missed the scene where jason bourne was stacking shelves
2920692 come on over to the slightly darker but much more fun side
2920693 never say i didnt try to throw you a life line
2920694 it is difficult to talk about parallels between norilsk and tnk bp
2920695 but i agree with you that a conflict of such nature is destroying the company in the short and medium term
2920696 however if we defend our position in the longer term two years or more it will be beneficial for the company and its shareholders
2920697 norilsk nickel is a company which consolidates the industry our consolidation effort will require cooperation with the state
2920698 steven spielberg and david geffen may announce as soon as this week a deal with reliance ada group to set up a new studio and split from paramount pictures sources familiar with the deal said on sunday

2920705 that money will be used only for the steeple absolutely
2920706 our bookkeeping is very stringent here and the accounts are isolated
2920707 i believe the republican leadership council supports an agenda the majority of americans already support

2920713 we dont need another politician in washington who puts self interest and political expediency ahead of problem solving

2920715 i put my country first then and will continue to put country first
2920716 while theres no doubt senator mccain has served his country with honor the agenda hes supported over the last eight years has not served the nation as well
2920717 i dont think its about john mccain its about making obama different foreign other
2920718 these people are running a bad version of the last campaign 2008 is not 2004
2920719 i said at that time i would much rather lose a political campaign than lose a war senator obama took a different path
2920720 when we didnt work as a team they broke us down we were a team and we had leaders

2920729 my wife was born at davidson sic monthan air force base
2920730 the single growth meter is going to be water we may get to a point we have to figure out ways we no longer grow

2920743 somewhere along the line i lost it a little bit who knows where it went

2920745 im just having fun playing again not pressing so much
2920746 i know were below 500 but it doesnt feel that way at this time last year it felt like we had only won 20 games or something but this is such a good group of guys its fun
2920747 thats always been my thing i just need to take a little pressure off myself and just go after guys i think it might come to my approach where i care too much and im trying to do too much and carry a huge load its not that hard im going to go back out there tonight and get ready for my next start but im just going to take a different approach next time and just have fun with it a little bit i feel like im pressing a little too much
2920748 now im going to face guys two or three times and you just cant pump heaters all day long
2920749 its something that i just have to forget about and really just stop caring as much i have to stop being at 99percent and maybe drop it down to 85 until i have to kick it back up its a learning process
2920750 i mean should i discuss basic anatomy physiology and differences thereof the chapter talks about drug and alcohol abuse how deeply should i go into that it also discusses contraception abortion and various human sexuality issues should i discuss those at all and if so how much
2920751 why people say that the god of the old testament is different from the god of the new testament is beyond me the means of salvation is by grace through faith the old testament people were saved looking forward to the cross of christ shown in all the blood sacrifices offered with a clean motive and the people from the cross forward are saved by looking back to the cross of christ by faith
2920752 also i think that traditional clergy laity distinctions have more to do with tradition than scripture
2920753 regarding clergy laity distinctions yes i guess that is a
2920754 but then again if what was fated did not happen then was it really fated
2920755 the first key in communication between two people is understanding how each other is using the terms he she is using and proceed thusly

2920862 oh what tangled webs arise when first we start to subsidize
2920863 the multibillion dollar annual government subsidies that domestic ethanol has long enjoyed
2920864 as a free trade advocate he also opposes the 54 cent a gallon tariff that the united states slaps on imports of ethanol made from sugar cane
2920865 it takes more than a calorie of fossil fuel energy to produce a calorie of corn

2920867 we hear it at weddings at the super bowl big bad voodoo daddy in 1999 with the brian setzer orchestra its a great american fusion that crosses genders cultures and generations
2920868 we think of ourselves as a theater not a dinner theater
2920869 i want to create and pay my bills as long as i can spend all day at the theater ill be happy

2920873 its more of a team unity thing nick and i ran it
2920874 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2920875 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2920876 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2920877 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2920878 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2920879 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2920880 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities and balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2920881 to be a force to be reckoned with means a lot this year has just been phenomenal its just crazy
2920882 i cant believe we dont win a race in three or four weeks and were in a slump
2920883 i never could get the runs in the right spots
2920884 i needed to stay with him to be close enough to try to make a move in a braking zone we never could get close enough to get an opportunity
2920885 i hope i can give the wood brothers a shot in the arm that they need to really get the momentum to move forward
2920886 all banks are going through kind of a tough time and so are we interim president and ceo barry backhaus said in an interview last week
2920887 you always expect once in a while some years to come along that dont work out and this is one of them
2920888 i knew it was going to go down i just didnt know the bottom was going to drop out said kobs who bought 210 shares after the bank went public in the 1990s over the years she plowed her dividends into buying more stock
2920889 quiet period mandated by securities regulators prior to release of such a report vantus leaders last week declined to discuss financial details but backhaus said the banks performance is starting to turn around

2920908 he went off and voted with minority leader harry reid on the democratic substitute and i wrote him the now famous letter
2920909 i would like to apologize to you for assuming that your private assurances to me regarding your desire to cooperate in our efforts to negotiate bipartisan lobbying reform legislation were sincere
2920910 im embarrassed to admit that after all these years in politics i failed to interpret your previous assurances as typical rhetorical gloss routinely used in politics to make self interested partisan posturing appear more noble
2920911 that was one incident where he thought i had undercut him i had a completely different view of it
2920912 we had to take tough votes sometimes against the majority of our own party in order to preserve the coalition
2920913 when colleagues disagree on an issue the notion that its cause for attack is mistaken i felt very strongly that the guest worker program was not in the best interests of the country i voted against it he voted for it i respect sen mccains right to take positions different than mine what i dont do is abuse his integrity for doing so
2920914 we can disagree on issues without trying to tear down the other persons reputation or attack his character
2920915 this is a person who has engaged and energized millions of americans who had never been engaged in the political process
2920916 a fast fair and cost effective dispute resolution mechanism under which providers may submit disputes to the plan
2920917 in the same breath that theyre said to be apolitical theyre said to be a celebration of human rights and theyre said to be a sporting festival we hope that can transcend mere sporting festivals
2920918 i think when we talk about the crisis in darfur we talk about the millions of innocent people that are suffering there and we talk about the positive role that china could play should they choose to and the rest of the international community i mean these people have been failed i think at every level
2920919 chinese authorities have in the past cracked down prior to big international events
2920920 the first plan was to try to return his serve
2920921 he started to serve i think very slowly and i did very good returns i broke very early in the first set and after that i start to play my game i dont give him any chance to break my serve i play unbelievable
2920922 hes playing confident tennis and it seems like hes playing without a care in the world right now and you see that happen
2920923 i didnt know if i was going to play much less make a final
2920924 i probably wouldve taken that at the beginning of the week
2920925 i couldve played really well and im not sure it would have mattered
2920926 in the tiebreak i did unbelievable shots unbelievable points and that was the difference
2920927 everybody is going to talk about how big it is but he can hit it both ways
2920928 he hits this way and this way kind of equally and he can hit it from inside out and running to it which is a good thing for him bad for the rest of us
2920929 i always get a kick out of when everybody acts shocked when young players start winning matches like it hasnt been happening for the last 100 years
2920930 i think the biggest thing is these guys are huge i remember i was kind of big once upon a time as far as tennis standards

2920933 nach der erfolgreichen akquisition der cenes und auf der grundlage unserer bereits unter beweis gestellten entwicklung und partnering expertise ist es unser ziel paion weiter erfolgreich voranzubringen und den wert unseres gest rkten und risko optimierten portfolios zu steigern
2920934 im hinblick auf die nahe zukunft ist hier als werttreiber insbesondere cns 7056 hervorzuheben
2920935 es war wahrlich kein perfektes wochenende f r mich ich muss an meinen starts arbeiten denn da liegt derzeit mein gr tes problem mein team hat mir die volle unterst tzung daf r zugesichert meine rennen waren eigentlich ganz gut in der tabelle konnte ich an jeremy van horebeek wieder vorbei gehen leider ist steven frossard nun siebter weshalb ich auf dem achten rang bleibe
2920936 ich habe immer noch probleme mit meinen z hnen ich habe mich davon aber nicht ablenken lassen und an diesem wochenende alles gegeben ich denke meine ergebnisse sprechen daf r und ich glaube dass ich gezeigt habe was m glich ist wenn ich wieder gesund bin
2920937 die geschwindigkeit und das ding mit der steilkurve das ist rodeln
2920938 durch die fliehkr fte klebt man quasi an der bahn man erlebt ein einmaliges gef hl das s chtig macht
2920939 nun wird jeder erkennen dass wir viel mehr sind als eine skihalle
2920940 man entwickelt auf diesen strecken schon ein gef hl f r die geschwindigkeit und man merkt wie man seinen k rper sogar ein bisschen anspannen muss
2920941 aber wir wollen die trasse ja auch durch unsere skihalle f hren und da haben sich einige unerwartete schwierigkeiten ergeben
2920942 die statischen berechnungen und auch die ma nahmen des brandschutzes brauchen mehr zeit als gedacht
2920943 die veranstaltung war rundum gelungen von den bedingungen auf dem wasser ber die organisation an land hat alles sehr gut geklappt besonders gefreut haben mich die begeisterung und das gro e interesse der vielen zuschauer ein toller austragungsort f r einen dwc
2920944 meine eltern haben es vorgeschlagen und ich fand es gut
2920945 wenn es mir mal nicht so gut geht h rt frau glemser das an meinem spiel
2920946 er schafft es dem instrument so viel gef hl und so unterschiedliche kl nge zu entlocken das bewundere ich
2920947 wir wollen kostrom bewusst aus der nische holen und durch den g nstigen preis allen verbrauchern den umstieg erm glichen
2920948 mein plan ist aufgegangen mit einem starken start konnte ich mich vorne behaupten anschlie end musste ich die f hrung gegen daniel verteidigen das war ein hartes st ck arbeit
2920949 ich bin sehr zufrieden vor allem nach meinen verpatzen rennen in hockenheim wo ich nicht punkten konnte
2920950 endlich gab es f r mich mal wieder eine champagner dusche auf dem podium ein tolles rennen mich freut besonders dass ich das tempo der spitze mitgehen konnte
2920951 das hat unglaublich viel spa gemacht ich bin mit dem mini challenge virus infiziert
2920952 die hanse sail rostock ist erwachsen geworden als gr tes allj hrlich stattfindendes traditionsseglertreffen weltweit ist die hanse sail nicht nur f r rostock und unser land die wichtigste veranstaltung sie hat sich auch als zuverl ssiger partner f r die f rderung der traditionsschifffahrt im ostseeraum erwiesen crews aus 13 nationen sowie ein millionenpublikum aus dem in und ausland haben die herzliche gastfreundschaft der rostockerinnen und rostocker gesp rt so bleiben erinnerungen an unvergessliche augenblicke auf see und an den kaikanten an den b hnen und entlang der vergn gungsmeilen ich danke allen die zu diesem tollen erfolg beigetragen haben
2920953 wir haben ein gro es fest erlebt die 18 hanse sail rostock wird in wenigen stunden die flagge f r 2008 einholen mit 230 schiffen aus 13 nationen kulturellen attraktionen und bunten m rkten war die hanse sail 2008 ein ereignis das lange in guter erinnerung bleiben wird
2920954 ich dachte erst ich habe die gorch fock vor mir
2920955 der hanse sail markt im stadthafen wurde sehr gut besucht
2920956 bei den h ndlern variieren die zahlen nat rlich je nach angebotener ware aber die fahrgesch fte waren gut ausgelastet und der bier und imbissbereich lief sehr gut
2920957 die kosten insgesamt steigen und das kaufverhalten der besucher verschlechtert sich
2920958 vor allem die hohe frequenz an den b hnen belebt die veranstaltung und nat rlich auch die umliegenden st nde
2920959 im mai 2009 kommen alle koggen nach kampen zum mittelaltertreffen
2920960 se han sellado y restaurado varios puntos de vertido incontrolado se han construido puntos de clasificaci n y separaci n para rcds residuos de la construcci n y demolici n y se han realizado restauraciones paisaj sticas de los puntos de vertido incontrolado de rcds
2920961 es hat gro en spa gemacht gegen starke konkurrenz hier in most zu fahren immerhin waren insgesamt fast 40 fahrzeuge am start darunter f nf ehemalige autos aus der dtm
2920962 ich muss in meinem job sehr viel reisen da bleibt nicht viel zeit f r einen festen freund
2920963 ich wei schon dass die m nner die mir sagen dass sie mich heiraten wollen es nicht ernst meinen
2920964 ich mag den klassischen gro en dunkelhaarigen typen ein bisschen wie george clooney
2920965 ich steh nicht auf billige anmachspr che und wenn ein typ mich bedr ngt bin ich gleich weg das schlimmste was ein mann tun kann ist nach meiner telefonnummer zu fragen und mich dauernd anzurufen und nicht aufh ren zu reden
2920966 es ist oft der einzige weg den druck abzubauen der sich angestaut hat
2920967 ich trinke nicht besonders viel ab und zu mal ein glas rotwein oder gelegentlich eine margarita aber ich war noch nie richtig betrunken dazu kommt noch dass ich sehr gern tanze aber leider ein hoffnungsloser fall bin
2920968 salsa oder tango tanze ich nur allein in meinem schlafzimmer ich tanze so mies dass sogar meine freunde sagen ich solle lieber beim tennis bleiben
2920969 als kind stolperte ich dauernd ber meine f e ich war total unsportlich
2920970 ich habe beim zug am startseil nicht genug kraft aufgebracht
2920971 ich kann es nicht glauben f r mich wird ein traum war dass ich deutschland bei der em vertreten darf ist eine gro e ehre f r mich
2920972 wie es sich f r eine ordentliche rockband geh rt verziehen wir uns wieder auf die b hne
2920973 palm centro has the power of a broadband smartphone at the price of a standard 12 key phone
2920974 a correct world view is having an intellectual and moral center that allows one to distinguish between right and wrong
2920975 a politician who bases positions on polls and clamoring interest groups rather than the national interest is a person without a core
2920976 grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and the bombing outside of south ossetia
2920977 my administration has been engaged with both sides in this trying to get a cease fire
2920978 100 focused on solving this peacefully we respect georgias territorial integrity and we expect russia to do the same
2920979 would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2920980 this situation could be resolved peacefully so they have held that door open
2920981 this statement ambassador is absolutely unacceptable particularly from the lips of the permanent representative of a country whose actions we are aware of including with regard to civilian populations in iraq afghanistan and serbia
2920982 we have no plans to insert money into either of those two institutions
2920983 given that fannie mae and freddie mac are solely involved in housing thats their sole business and given the magnitude of the housing correction weve had its not a surprise to me to see those losses
2920984 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products
2920985 what makes it even more impressive is the fact that its a summer film and its taking on all competitors and prevailing in such a profound way
2920986 the 40 million for us was just like wow we couldnt be happier
2920987 everything about this movie has just played out really well
2920988 i know i love the idea of the back nine of a major on a sunday
2920989 i love it so much that im actually disappointed im seven months away from the next major and i dont know what im going to do
2920990 i love the feeling of knowing that its going to come down to the back nine its going to come down to who can do it under pressure in the last nine holes
2920991 obviously things like that will take time to sink in
2920992 at the moment im just enjoying the pga win for the pga win
2920993 i kind of felt like i had won the pga at that stage
2920994 obviously i was trying to win but thats it its not disappointing
2920995 when you give it your best and the end result is not what you wish for its hard but you feel good
2920996 the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
2920997 the speech refers to the social development of not just traditional family groups but also relationships including triples obviously alluding to polyamorous relationships
2920998 we were always concerned that the civil unions legislation would signal a move away from recognising and promoting marriage as the preferable and best environment for children to be raised however this speech would suggest that we are on a slippery slope to recognising any form of relationship including polygamy and polyamory
2920999 labour is redefining parenthood in a way nobody ever considered and based on a rights and anti discrimination culture we may soon be legalising incestuous relationships
2921000 marriage between a woman and a man should be given special status and encouraged by the state not weakened and compromised as is now happening marriage is an important social good with a smorgasbord of positive outcomes for children and adults alike
2921001 its very surprising it appears that the spanish anti doping controls didnt detect anything in their tests back in spain before the athlete traveled out
2921002 we dont know how many tests she underwent but obviously she didnt pass the last one were examining the case

2921005 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2921006 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient
2921007 i was shocked when i saw how much money came flooding into my paypal account
2921008 if youve trusted my judgment through the years please trust my judgment now mitt romney is the right man for america
2921009 frankly my focus is on the caucuses here in iowa i think mike is more concerned about the caucus in los angeles
2921010 i figure its the only way i can be in south carolina and nevada at the same time but in reality mike huckabee did it before in iowa and he won so maybe itll do the same thing for me
2921011 they say of some temporal suffering no future bliss can make up for it not knowing that heaven once attained will work backwards and turn even that agony into glory
2921012 the heavens declare the glory of god your love is strong
2921013 both of our hands are equally skilled at doing evil
2921014 all along i thought i was learning how to take how to bend not how to break how to live not how to cry really ive been learning how to die
2921015 launched an absurd project to impose democracy all over the world
2921016 the us has a strange idea of democracy they first interfered with the bosnian situation bombed yugoslavia then afghanistan and then iraq
2921017 the us must understand that democracy cannot be introduced by force by the army
2921018 while we always sought to help the bulgarians the serbs the montenegrins we would have done better to think first of the belorussians and ukrainians with the weighty hand of empire we deprived them of cultural and spiritual development in their own traditions the endless wars for balkan christians were a crime against the russian people the attempt to greater russify all of russia proced damaging not only to the living national traits of all the other ethnicities in the empire byt was foremost detrimental to the greater russian nationality itself the aims of a great empire and the moral health of the people are incompatible holding on to a great empire means to contribute to the extinction of our own people
2921019 inspired by american classics and finished with a modern edge and fresh spirit
2921020 its important they are able to go to work in our community and fill the need
2921021 the community had a lot of feedback and that is what weve used to design our program

2921027 i have been training a lot with my brother to achieve this win
2921028 the main rules have not changed since the beginning of the competition 10 years ago we have 6 men or women sitting inside the sauna on each round and the winner is the last one to leave
2921029 there are no world records we cannot control all the factors like the temperature of the sauna or the water thrown into the stove
2921030 we did a little conga line as a team and everybody just loved it we gained some fan support just like that
2921031 they play this dutch music so we just started dancing with them during the rain delay it was a big scene
2921032 this is going to be interesting just because the culture is so different
2921033 the bus was probably three to four times the size of a regular transit bus
2921034 we scrubbed and mopped and swept for six hours in the press room
2921035 it feels like a carnival or a festival going at all times bands playing mariachis going its more than just baseball
2921036 the rest of it was like old ruins blown out old stuff with no windows or anything they raised some cain and got us moved to a better hotel in downtown havana
2921037 the elevator took 30 minutes to go up two floors it makes you appreciate america that much more the fans were great it was packed every game they appreciate baseball it was really nice to see that kind of stuff if you made a nice defensive play theyd stand and give you an ovation
2921038 we experienced some extremely bad rain and thunderstorms like right in the middle of our games which is pretty unusual
2921039 the funny thing was we played right through it they didnt call the game so we just had to play through it its extremely tough to throw with a wet ball to have to do that for a couple of innings was very challenging it was a good experience you get to experience how other countries rules are and how they play the game i wasnt going to complain
2921040 essentiellement sur la prospection et lexploitation de r serves de minerai de fer et de mangan se
2921041 if you want to lose your money bet on sonny
2921042 i had the referee check the gloves and it wasnt the gloves and some people say it might have been the alcohol they were rubbing on listons shoulders but it wasnt that
2921043 what it was was the monsels solution the cut man joe polino used its very caustic it burns the tissues it closes the cut turns the area black its banned now
2921044 i stuck my pinkie in my fighters eye stuck it in my eye and it burned like hell thats what it was
2921045 the kid wanted to talk to the ref because he felt something bad was going on but i didnt want that so i grabbed him by the wrists and stood him up before the 10 second buzzer and i told him to run
2921046 to never get involved with a fighters personal life or his religion had a fighter once he was complaining about his wife and i said thats women he went back told her angelo sided with him and that was that he split with his wife split with me
2921047 and then i took willie pastrano to fight chick calder in scotland we look it up we go to a catholic church to pray he gets his picture taken with a catholic priest theres no way we get a decision unless ive got a gun that was protestant territory
2921048 the west end is a world class destination with 3 5 million visitors every week and these cheap and tatty signs have no part in its future
2921049 visitors expect and enjoy the buzz of the busy streets around oxford street and covent garden but they do not want to fight their way past these signs cluttering up the pavement or see them disfiguring a beautiful conservation area
2921050 we are heading out on two expeditions each close to a month long to map the full length of the cayman trough
2921051 it is the worlds deepest volcanic ridge and totally unexplored
2921052 we are hoping to find several different types of vents along the ridge
2921053 some of the vents will be very similar in depth to the vents we already know about and because the conditions will be alike we might expect very similar animals
2921054 the deep ocean is our planets largest ecosystem if we are going to use its resources responsibly then we need understand what determines its patterns of life
2921055 now that we have access to intermediates that were not previously available people will want to do careful studies on their pharmacological activity and we were getting yields of 100 to 200 milligrams per litre which is respectable for potentially valuable molecules with relatively simple optimisation of the fermentation you could obtain 10 or 100 times more than this
2921056 its very exciting that plant alkaloid pathways are starting to be reconstituted in microbes very importantly smolke has also shown how this strain can be used to discover new enzymes that catalyse biosynthetic transformations
2921057 we are now hoping to extend the pathway both ways to get a broader range of intermediates downstream including the end products and to be able to start with simpler substrates upstream
2921058 the system will also allow us to start producing non natural alkaloids by using enzymes from different sources and in combinations that do not occur in nature
2921059 usually it takes three men and two months to build any type of ship but this time we needed at least five to 10 builders to work on it over eight months to make it ready it was a hard but enjoyable job
2921060 the most difficult part will be circumnavigating around the cape of good hope where many shipwrecks are testimony to the difficult conditions there
2921061 you can get big waves of 20 metres or more there it is a dangerous area and well be there in december and january

2921107 here i hit some of the wildest golf shots ever hit on a golf course on friday but i knew i had the ability to win if i got a chance in the end it was a lot of sheer willpower that won it
2921108 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
2921109 you have to get focused and give it a go
2921110 if a couple of things had gone differently we would have been talking differently
2921111 the good thing about it is i felt good out there i definitely feel like i played well enough to win but unfortunately it didnt happen the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it

2921118 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2921119 they were confused as to why an american boy not more then nineteen years of age would want to come to an old place of worship i told them that i was a jew and i wanted to be by a place that belongs to my people to show them that we would always be there and be strong when i got to the shul and saw the disrepair it was in at the time i broke down crying
2921120 i never dreamed that i would be walking in what had been a synagogue in such great disrepair in the heart of the soviet union to now have it glistening and glowing with new jewish life

2921249 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2921250 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2921251 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2921252 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2921253 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2921259 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2921260 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2921261 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2921277 there are huge differences between obama and mccain you wont get your pure progressive candidate unless you live in vermont and can vote for bernie sanders and even he doesnt support impeachment
2921278 so wake up already and realize that you have two choices vote for obama who is far from perfect or do anything else but realize that by doing so you are helping mccain to win and that includes just bashing obama without offering constructive criticism
2921279 as anticipated early this year the group expects conditions to remain challenging for the remainder of 2008 characterised by a slow down in corrugated demand growth and broad based cost inflation

2921290 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2921291 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2921292 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2921293 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2921294 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2921295 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2921296 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2921297 who are open to doing something on the production side
2921298 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2921299 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2921300 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2921301 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2921302 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2921303 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2921304 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2921305 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2921306 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2921307 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2921308 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2921309 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2921310 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2921311 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2921312 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2921313 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2921314 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2921315 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2921316 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2921317 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2921318 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2921319 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2921320 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2921321 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2921322 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2921323 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2921324 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2921325 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2921326 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2921327 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2921328 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2921329 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2921330 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2921331 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2921332 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2921333 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2921334 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2921335 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2921336 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2921337 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2921338 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2921339 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2921340 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2921341 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2921342 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2921343 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2921344 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2921345 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2921346 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2921347 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2921348 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2921349 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2921350 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2921351 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2921352 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2921353 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

2921359 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2921360 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2921361 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2921362 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2921363 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2921364 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2921365 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2921366 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2921367 as a es da federa o da r ssia n o colocam em risco apenas a vida dos cidad os da ge rgia mas tamb m de convidados estrangeiros de alta hierarquia
2921368 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2921369 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2921370 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2921371 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2921372 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2921373 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2921374 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2921375 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2921376 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2921377 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2921378 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

2921384 its that old saying if you are good enough you are old enough and he is good enough
2921385 he has been absolutely killing it in the under 20s lately and we have seen already this year guys who have been stand outs in that competition jumping up and making an impact straight away at the senior level
2921386 the thing about him is he is very calm and very composed he doesnt get rushed and like a lot of the young guys coming through these days he is really confident and has no problem getting in there and taking charge
2921387 i am still just tossing up whether or not it is too early
2921388 hes pretty nervous hes been nervous just coming up and training the fact is he is only a boy so he is up here having the time of his life at the moment
2921389 im not worried about him being targeted or anything he has the speed and the footy smarts to look after himself and there is no doubting his ability i just want to sleep on it and well see after the team meeting in the morning
2921390 obviously sergio followed it up with a great shot but i had the opportunity to get the putt in first
2921391 i knew if i holed this i probably would win the pga if i missed sergio would probably win so it was down to that and i hit a lovely putt
2921392 at birkdale british open i was quite assured of what i was doing here i really didnt know
2921393 i wasnt happy with how i was swinging the club this week in terms of my focus or maybe dehydration or tiredness but something had me a little bit off stride
2921394 my co ordination wasnt quite there my game was going downhill very quickly once i got to the weekend and holed a few putts it really was a question of adrenalin keeping me going
2921395 its a bit like the greg norman story at birkdale where norman finished third
2921396 its a great story but you cant let yourself get drawn into it youve got to be very selfish in this situation when youre on the course
2921397 i had to convince myself not to get into this sentimental thing of maybe its his turn maybe he deserves it maybe its his day
2921398 the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
2921399 i feel like i have played well enough to win probably more than two majors throughout my career unfortunately it hasnt happened but that doesnt mean im not on the right track

2921408 last week mcintyre trumped him with a tome entitled the death of irish republicanism published as the irish and british governments commissioned a report from the international monitoring commission imc designed to ascertain if the ira army council is still in existence
2921409 mcintyre a former ira commander who served 18 years for murder and then did a phd in republican history is right
2921410 mcintyre paints a picture of a republican leadership who were reformists from the outset being secretly protected groomed and eventually steered into stormont by the british forces they claimed to be fighting
2921411 it has not been unconditional surrender and it has been infinitely better than continuing to fight a futile war for the sake of honouring irelands dead yet producing only more of them but let us not labour under any illusions that the conditions were good

2921430 the planning commission had drawn up a detailed plan for investment of about 500 billion in infrastructure during the 11th five year plan the government should release status on project implementation and enumerate the reasons for delays in implementation which in turn could facilitate measures to speed up the implementation of large infrastructure projects

2921433 let there be no doubt in your minds that the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilize this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america
2921434 dont allow the fruits of the victory achieved through the sacrifices of the mujahedeen fighting in afghanistan iraq and the tribal belt of pakistan to be hijacked by the politicians who sat passively while the girls and boys of the red mosque perished and burned
2921435 these are the same politicians who follow the tenets of an alien western democratic system and judiciary and exploit islam to fulfill their own greedy aims

2921558 its mean spirited state employees did not cause our political crisis and they should not be held hostage
2921559 yesterday the governor sent some of his computer experts to try to help him comply with the law
2921560 hes not the kind of person who just goes out don quixote style and attacks the windmills
2921561 before the executive order controller john chiang was just the name that appeared on our paychecks
2921562 by standing up to the governor for what is right he has become an instant hero to thousands of state employees and other working people
2921563 what were really trying to do is help the family
2921564 we want this to be a bright welcoming place where people feel comfortable and where they can enjoy their time with a family member and not have to worry about cleaning and cooking and all of the things involved in care
2921565 many of these residents dont have families close by to take care of them

2921574 a metaphor for the loss of eden for the sorrows of dispossession and exile for the declining power of the arab world in its dealings with the west
2921575 against barbarity poetry can resist only by confirming its attachment to human fragility like a blade of grass growing on a wall while armies march by
2921576 i thought poetry could change everything could change history and could humanize and i think that the illusion is very necessary to push poets to be involved and to believe
2921577 but now i think that poetry changes only the poet
2921578 i am still not a poet and sometimes i regret i chose this way
2921579 i was very strongly influenced by al mutanabbi and the mahjar poets emigrant poets such a kahlil gibran and modern arab poets such as qabbani al sayyab
2921580 garcia lorca pablo neruda yeats and today derek walcott is probably my favorite poet i also like the polish poets especially symborska

2921589 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2921590 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2921591 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2921592 i know that its not possible that this child could be mine because of the timing of events
2921593 ive never paid a dime of money to any of the people that are involved
2921594 ive never asked anybody to pay a dime of money never been told that any moneys been paid nothing has been done at my request so if the allegation is that somehow i participated in the payment of money that is a lie an absolute lie which is typical of these types of publications
2921595 published in a supermarket tabloid that is absolutely not true
2921596 i cannot make any sense out of that when i went to this meeting youve already asked me about uh i was not wearing a t shirt i was wearing a long sleeved shirt with the sleeves rolled up i dont know who that picture i dont know if that picture is me it could well be it looks like me i dont know who that baby is i have no idea what that picture is
2921597 i dont know if the picture has been altered manufactured if its a picture of me taken some other time holding another baby i have no idea
2921598 i was not at this meeting holding a child for my photograph to be taken i can tell you that

2921605 weve become a locally significant nature center and we hold programs anywhere from sun valley all the way down to long beach and into gardena
2921606 weve just become known as the place to go for natural history in the area and native plant gardening instruction
2921607 so weve grown at such a rate we felt like the best way to realize our potential is to start up a foundation and help fund the programs that are not funded by the city of torrance

2921626 i dont know how people define major media coverage whether the network evening news that comes on before wheel of fortune is covering what were doing the american people know whats happening and the american people are with us i saw that with my own eyes when i was home in indiana people stopping me on the street stopping me at the state fair coming up to me at gas stations saying keep doing what youre doing its working

2921633 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities

2921638 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2921639 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2921640 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2921641 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2921642 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2921643 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2921644 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2921645 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2921646 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2921647 fashion is not something that exists in dresses only fashion is in the sky in the street fashion has to do with ideas the way we live what is happening

2921650 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools

2921652 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2921653 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2921654 the u n secretary general is profoundly concerned over mounting tensions in the abkhaz zone of conflict
2921655 precision strikes against military infrastructure in order to prevent georgian aircraft and military attack on our peacekeepers
2921656 we want to force the georgian leadership to peace and what we see right now on the ground is that georgian troops not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armor and increased attacks on tskhinvali
2921657 my administration has been engaged with both sides of this trying to get a ceasefire
2921658 for his governments restraint offers of cease fire and disengagement of georgian forces from the zone of conflict in the south ossetian region of the country

2921705 asking questions of presidents has always been a huge responsibility
2921706 she feels that if she doesnt ask the question it wont get asked
2921707 her parents couldnt read or write and here is this woman who moved to washington where she didnt know anybody and made a life for herself
2921708 she tells very specific stories and has great insight about life and presidents
2921709 when i walked the streets of washington with her there were always people following us wanting to say something to her
2921710 helen represents something beyond who she is and people are aware of that
2921711 thats a great moment showing the kind of relationship journalists then had with presidents the access
2921712 it takes a nation of millions to hold us back
2921713 its the kind of show you have to bring something to you cant just come and sit back and let it happen you have to bring your memories you have to bring your 1993 self
2921714 when you first mention it to artists a lot of them their initial reaction is whats wrong with our new stuff

2921717 after every single record ive finished ive said in my own head or to other people wouldnt it be great if we could just go out and perform it top to bottom
2921718 as i perform the songs i had the time and focus to really think about what i was thinking about when i wrote that song
2921719 i have such a huge catalog now that i dont get to play a lot of the songs
2921720 and i miss a lot of them we only have so much room in the set i loved the idea because it kind of satisfied my need to get all those songs out again

2921732 i dont have to worry about listening to beatnik poetry or some political ideology that makes me want to vomit
2921733 conservative doesnt mean you belong to a certain political party
2921734 it caused me a little bit of a problem but people should get over it
2921735 the price he paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2921736 and now he embraces the failed bush policies over the last eight years politics that helped break washington in the first place and that doesnt exactly meet my definition of a maverick
2921737 it was always going to have to be a part of our campaign for the general election
2921738 sure hes been in washington 26 years but hes always been a reformer always worked across party lines sacrificed his own political interests to do so
2921739 so we were always going to have to tell that narrative because some people know it but not everybody
2921740 he can point to areas where he broke with the bush administration where he broke with his own party
2921741 that part of the maverick image probably isnt going away
2921742 the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008
2921743 john mccain has changed hes taken the low road leveling false negative and misleading attacks against barack obama
2921744 arent just red herrings distracting the working class from economic struggles rather theyre at the root of working class insecurity
2921745 the architect of a working class conservatism that would shape american politics for the next quarter century

2921756 do not be distressed because of the lad and your maid whatever sarah tells you listen to her for through isaac your descendants shall be named
2921757 and of the son of the maid i will make a nation also because he is your descendant
2921758 what is the matter with you hagar do not fear for god has heard the voice of the lad where he is
2921759 arise lift up the lad and hold him by the hand for i will make a great nation of him

2921843 its just the ups and downs of the season in the league
2921844 you cant lean on what you did in the past youve got to keep building each and every year you never know what the stats are i dont try to look into the stats or anything i just try to go out there and give it my all
2921845 these players expect you during the course of the game to make calls according to what you see
2921846 if you know it dont be afraid being a safety that position tells you that you have to dictate even though you might feel uncomfortable because the guys on the outside the cornerbacks might be older than you if you know what the call is and its what its supposed to be you have to be strong in your convictions to know that were going to do it this way and this is how well play the guys will respect that and i think hes understanding that
2921847 you cant hold a team like that down forever we had a couple of bad breaks you lose a ball in the sun in the first inning it could be a different game
2921848 whoever you are for i have always depended on the kindness of strangers
2921849 but i feel like im starting to kind of prove myself that i can handle the nerves so hopefully maybe you guys will ease up a little bit
2921850 people say dont worry about it think of it as just another meet well its not another meet
2921851 you just have to say im going to go out there and try to have my best swim if it ends up i get a gold awesome
2921852 getting a bronze does still leave me a little bit hungry for something a little bit higher
2921853 do you prefer silver does that mean you prefer a silver medal
2921854 i was like my earrings have nothing to do with the medal i want i honestly want the gold
2921855 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts
2921856 she beat me to wall but im proud of myself because i swam a smart race
2921857 this morning bob bowman had said the french was saying some stuff talking a little bit of trash
2921858 his last 50 meters were absolutely incredible and he had a perfect finish
2921859 i wanted to go 1 45 and without my messed up finish it would have been that
2921860 its fine i just wanted to save as much energy as i could for the relay
2921861 like i said plaxico burress has to take care of plaxico burress
2921862 i have to make all the right judgments as far as my health before i go out there on the football field
2921863 some sectors had previously expanded in a rough manner efforts to shut down small inefficient plants in favour of big scale ones have yielded results

2921875 delete all empty source folders after the source files are moved
2921876 people have gotten on my lane line and sucked off of me so i figured this is the one opportunity in my whole career to do that
2921877 jason finished that race better than we could even ask for i was fired up going into that last 50 i was like aw this is going to be a close race jasons last 10 or 15 meters were incredible
2921878 i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional out there
2921879 i knew i was going to have to swim out of my mind
2921880 i dont know how i was able to take it back that fast because ive never been able to come anywhere near that for the last 50
2921881 i knew i had to accelerate but it got harder
2921882 i saw katie and thought lets just try to catch her
2921883 but i got a bronze yesterday and a silver this morning if i keep climbing at this pace ill be happy
2921884 ive just had a really off year on a really important year
2921885 i just feel like thats not the last youre going to see of me im going to bring it back and i wont be done until i at least have a legitimate shot at those world records again
2921886 thats a hell of a swim and he is a true champion
2921887 natalies just so good at racing and planning out her races so i just expect nothing but fast fast swimming tomorrow morning
2921888 its exactly where i wanted to be going into the finals im happy with that i just need to recover and focus on my final
2921889 if after this war a situation is allowed to develop in the world which permits rival powers to be in uncontrolled possession of these new means of destruction the cities of the united states as well as the cities of other nations will be in continuous danger of sudden annihilation
2921890 all the resources of the united states moral and material may have to be mobilized to prevent the advent of such a world situation its prevention is at present the solemn responsibility of the united states singled out by virtue of her lead in the field of atomic power
2921891 in certain circumstances find itself forced to resort to the use of atomic bombs
2921892 then in certain circumstances find itself forced to resort to the use of atomic bombs such a step however ought not to be made at any time without seriously considering the moral responsibilities which are involved
2921893 we can propose no technical demonstration likely to bring an end to the war we see no acceptable alternative to direct military use
2921894 if loving you is wrong i dont want to be right
2921895 if you really want to know about the mind the spirit and life itself read scientology the fundamentals of thought it will put you on the right path
2921896 let me tell you something wax enthusiastic and youll feel so a being causes his own feelings its the joy of creating uh
2921897 guys you have it all wrong were not like that i know thats your thing but get your information correct because somebody might believe that shit you know
2921898 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins
2921899 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians muslims mormons or jews
2921900 we never heard a peep out of isaac in any way until we did scientology he wants a different standard for religions other than his own and to me that is where intolerance and bigotry begin

2921906 four years ago we werent getting no cheers from nobody
2921907 this year we had chinese fans with us we had u s fans with us and im pretty sure we had a couple of other little countries out there too
2921908 we fought our hardest we tried to make it a good game i think we lost to a strong team
2921909 its good to get out here and get a game under your belt
2921910 we didnt play our a plus game today we played pretty good but we have a lot of room to improve
2921911 the fascinating thing is i didnt have a golf swing
2921912 i couldnt get to the clubhouse quick enough i felt tired possibly i was dehydrated whether that was causing it or not at least it was something tangible i could pin it on it gave me the belief that i could get it right and come back
2921913 i knew if i could just hang in there id get my opportunities
2921914 there was no backing off im a great believer in making what happens your own responsibility some days its not going to go your way you have to be prepared to handle that too
2921915 if youre going to finish second i guess qualifying is a victory in itself
2921916 i feel like i can help i think itll be good fun
2921917 i felt like i gave it my best harrington obviously played a very good back nine things just happened to go his way i dont regret anything i did out there
2921918 ive said before some guys get a little bit fortunate either because theyre playing well or someone comes back to them unfortunately it hasnt happened to me thats the way it is sometimes
2921919 i played nicely on a tough sunday at a major im pretty happy about that i just finished a little bit short ill go back home with my head held high and keep working on it it doesnt mean im not on the right track its just a matter of time
2921920 ive probably been the leading player in europe for 6 years
2921921 and i probably still get asked am i the leading player in europe so this is a good situation to be in its a big step to move up and start competing on a different level
2921922 ive still got phil mickelson who tied for seventh seven strokes back and tiger ahead of me in the world rankings i dont necessarily pay attention to what theyre doing i do believe i can improve its a long way to catch tiger but im putting a lot more things together im making things happen thats the only thing i can ask of myself
2921923 imdi bis numaras yapmayal m sahne arkas na gidip gelmek fuat i in zor olur son bir ark al p gidelim izninizle
2921924 we wouldnt be able to go and watch them as the train station will not sell us any train tickets so i dont really care
2921925 the slogan is now about a safe olympics and of course in the chinese way of doing things they impose more restrictions
2921926 and even if they are just buddist monks religious forces are always regarded by the chinese government as one of the political threats to the regime
2921927 they always come to ask us where have you been and who have you talked to
2921928 people say things will get better after the olympics but im not so sure
2921929 what happened today is important not only for bolivians but for all latin americans
2921930 i dedicate this victory to all the revolutionaries in the world
2921931 try to go ahead with the fight against poverty or it could just entrench the situation further
2921932 thats a 3 8 degree of difficulty and the reason its such a high degre of difficulty on that dive is because its so hard
2921933 that is directed at producing imminent lawless action and is likely to produce such action
2921934 i dont think this is an encouragement to engage in any illegal action
2921935 i think its more of the nature of a political statement we think it should be legalized
2921936 we just wanted to raise the social awareness to something that affects a lot of people
2921937 the teaching is genuine and real its biblical its cultural its relevant
2921938 andrew combines natural talent with a sophisticated understanding of the game i think im pretty good about giving him information and feedback in all aspects of the game i also try to keep him in the right mental state for success
2921939 bills one of the elite coaches in the united states
2921940 hes not excitable hes good under pressure and thinks rationally hes cool exactly the same in the ninth inning with the bases loaded as he is at the top of the first
2921941 wherever he coaches sailors exhibit distinct performance improvements his experience patience and clarity motivate sailors to reach within themselves for new levels of achievement
2921942 the trials were great preparation for dealing with the pressure of the olympic regatta
2921943 the challenge now is sailing against a fleet comprised of the best laser sailors in the world
2921944 sailing is not a 10 second sport its a marathon
2921945 bill has a dry sense of humor when pressure cooker situations come if you cant have fun in those moments youre simply not going to perform bill provides a sense of normalcy
2921946 the laser class has more competitive depth than any other fleet at the games there are at least 15 guys who could medal
2921947 most of the guys ranked ahead of him will be at the games if you had to pick a favorite it would probably be australias tom slingsby the world no 1 and two time defending world champion
2921948 from a coaching perspective this changes what you emphasize in training and your role on race day
2921949 the length of the races puts a premium on boat speed so we end up spending the majority of training time working on speed during competition you are much farther from the action than in college sailing you collect information for your sailor like wind and current readings and provide general support
2921950 i like the medal race it creates a lot of excitement
2921951 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage

2922008 the global oil price may be sliding but the weakness in the aussie is capping any falls in petrol pump prices
2922009 the australian dollar has fallen by almost 10 cents since its highs to around 89 us cents wiping out 10 cents of potential gains at the pump
2922010 there is no doubt that oil companies are cutting fuel prices however the lag period for the fall in prices needs to be questioned
2922011 the national average price should be much closer to 1 40 a litre by now rather than the 1 50
2922012 from june 1 till 5 30 pm today the total seasonal rainfall recorded at panjim is 1805 7 mm

2922014 the minister informed me of the request by a small number of papuans who had been granted protection visas in australia of their desire to explore the possibility of returning to papua
2922015 this of course is a matter for the papuans concerned and a matter between them and indonesia
2922016 there was a time in the relationship between australia and indonesia when such a discussion would have potentially caused great difficulties
2922017 because australia and indonesia are neighbours and partners and friends like family like neighbours there may from time to time be issues where you have difficulties or a small disagreement
2922018 we deal with these things in a business like manner we take it in our stride
2922019 which in the case of papua for example and generally respects indonesias territorial sovereignty over indonesia
2922020 i explained that this is the part of the latest trend that many papuans who have been living overseas want to return to papua
2922021 there were about 700 of them some living in papua new guinea
2922022 so this must be the reflection of good conditions in papua in terms of security and economic development
2922023 when it comes to terrorists who have been convicted and are subject to the death penalty australia does not as a policy make representations on their behalf
2922024 we understand the concerns expressed on the situations of their nationals
2922025 to me that was a strong indication of her love she is a fabulous person
2922026 very very very happy to report her condition is upgraded
2922027 theyre not at the point where they want to discuss the specific nature of the injuries
2922028 we are extremely grateful for the outpouring of assistance and generosity that we have received and hope to convey our appreciation to everyone who has supported us and kept us in their thoughts and prayers

2922037 this is one of the better trainings that ive attended in my many many years as a dispatcher

2922040 how would you like to discover amazing techniques to leave no child behind
2922041 lots of guys from bombay were at all three marches so whats this about us not participating its just that i think we wanted to do this a bit differently and no why cant we be different this way we can have our cake go for any of the other three marches and also have our own where other cities can participate this time we have large contingents coming from pune surat baroda bangalore ahmedabad delhi and kolkata
2922042 sure there are class community and other differences at least bombay handles it honestly i know there are diferences in kolkata delhi and bangalore too and they flare up quite frequently on the net here we sit down and thrash them out across the table there is a saying in hindi when there are so many vessels close together they do make noise
2922043 come on bombay is different it is the most corporate and business like of all indian cities do you think any other city would have thought of pink gandhi topis for the march it also shows indias pluralism

2922051 jason was good he got through the whole game which was exciting
2922052 his skills and touch at the start of the game were a fraction off because he has been out for ten weeks but he worked hard for us
2922053 when you get beaten by 20 goals it is hard to find the footy and hard to keep your composure and to keep working for the team but he did that which was great for us
2922054 we have match committee tomorrow but you would probably think he would need another game at vfl level
2922055 i was speaking to him this morning and he pulled up pretty sore he hasnt had a hit around or body contact for a long time so it takes an effect on you the week after
2922056 for him to get over his soreness and then get up and be right for another game i think he will need one more week but we will wait and see what happens
2922057 tommy worked hard but i would like to see him work harder

2922062 we played the old laws for a long time and i guess it had become trying to perfect what you were doing there now its a whole new ball game
2922063 once everyone gets used to these rules it might be like the old ones but for us its our fifth game under these laws and its the same for the south african coaches once weve had 20 under our belt we will have a pretty good idea of whats going on
2922064 i think its a different level of fitness its more of an aerobic fitness than explosive you still need explosiveness too but you need a better aerobic base
2922065 the balls in play a third of the time more than it was so guys have to run further in the same amount of time thats put another emphasis on the game
2922066 there is a lot more kicking and catching and kicking into space and ensuring you kick when you are in the right positions so there is a lot more research into that sort of stuff for the coaches
2922067 it may be more skilful i think its getting used to it it may be a more skilful game for 15 guys on the field in terms of them all being able to catch and pass and that sort of stuff
2922068 going into this game we will be the underdogs weve seen that home turf counts for a lot in this competition and they the springboks have a great record in south africa
2922069 yes and no its good in that everyone gets the opportunity to rest up but not so because you lose momentum
2922070 they have had rugby and game time and thats an advantage
2922071 the key thing for us is we prepare in a genuine fashion if your preparation is honest and bone deep then you are going to be ready

2922086 frente a esta situaci n ten amos dos opciones quedarnos a esperar pasivamente que los precios se ajusten a la realidad del pa s lo cual en alg n momento iba a ocurrir o salir a recomprar con el objetivo de mostrar que podemos pagar y vamos a hacerlo
2922087 la posibilidad de apelar a esta estrategia no es casual sino causal ya que surge de la robustez que evidencian las cuentas p blicas desde 2003 el ahorro fiscal acumulado en el ltimo lustro nico per odo de cinco a os consecutivos con excedentes anuales superiores al 3 por ciento del pbi en m s de 100 a os es lo que permite al gobierno tomar una medida que redundar en indudables ventajas fiscales

2922107 bajo controles de calidad que llevan a tener una producci n con los m s altos est ndares
2922108 de 7 a 21 todo un grupo familiar incluso ni os de cinco a diez a os
2922109 viven en condiciones infrahumanas de higiene y alimentaci n oblig ndolos a trabajar a todos los integrantes del n cleo familiar inclusive a los menores siendo el nico remunerado el jefe de la familia
2922110 en los siguientes controles que realizamos encontramos que m s personas trabajaban en las galpones eso demuestra que hab a trabajo infantil
2922111 yo a la ma ana ten a que mantener seco el guano y a la tarde juntar los huevos y adem s fumigar el galp n
2922112 ten a una p rdida y me sent a muy mal y no me dejaron salir de la granja para ir al hospital y reci n cuando estaba medio muerta me llevaron al m dico
2922113 como no me alcanzaba el tiempo para hacer todo la capataz viviana vallejos me retaba y cagaba a pedos y me dec a que me ayuden mi se ora y mis hijos
2922114 los chiquitos trabajan porque no alcanza el tiempo para terminar con todo el trabajo
2922115 los que van a la ma ana a la escuela trabajan de tarde y los que van a la tarde al colegio laburan a la ma ana porque si ellos no trabajan no se llega a cumplir con la producci n que exigen
2922116 cuando nos enferm bamos no nos dejaban ir al hospital y nos daban una bolsita de pastillas de colores en la oficina de la capataz
2922117 cuando tom s esas pastillas no ten s hambre ni sue o y segu s trabajando
2922118 al agua le ponen un qu mico que te quema la piel cuando lo toc s para que no se tapen las ca os de las tuber as de los bebederos de la gallinas

2922122 la elecci n del presidente fernando lugo es un rev s que no se esperaban en el vaticano despu s de esto ser a mejor que conozca lo que realmente est pasando en paraguay y am rica latina
2922123 estado vaticano porque no hizo una evaluaci n de la verdadera situaci n pol tica en paraguay
2922124 la candidatura pol tica de un obispo ser a un motivo de confusi n y de divisi n entre los fieles una ofensa al laicado
2922125 el vaticano muchas veces act a por razones de poder y en t rminos de poder me llam la atenci n la voltereta que dieron con lugo desde una condena muy dura que m s tarde tuvieron que abandonar y retractarse
2922126 yo no puedo decir lo que pasa por la cabeza de los cardenales del vaticano el vaticano es un barco muy grande y hay de todo all dentro pero parece que ellos cre an que lugo iba a perder por eso mandaron a un nuncio como orlando antonini que lleg hace diez meses con los tapones de punta contra lugo esto me parece que es resultado de una visi n errada de lo que est pasando deber a servir de lecci n
2922127 de qu puede servir la victoria de lugo en roma
2922128 hay una serie de asuntos que la iglesia podr a cambiar y no est dispuesta a hacerlo por ejemplo el celibato y esto de lugo puede ser un comienzo en el vaticano tienen miedo de que haya una desbandada con el fin del celibato lo cual es absurdo el caso de lugo est diciendo tambi n que la funci n del nuncio apost lico no es imponer rdenes de roma a las iglesias locales como hizo antonini
2922129 la victoria de lugo supone un resurgir de la teolog a de la liberaci n
2922130 no porque no estaba muerta ella estaba all en la vida cotidiana de la iglesia latinoamericana con menos fuerza es cierto pero viviendo cada d a lugo no es un te logo como el brasile o leonardo boff que acaba de visitar asunci n l no est trayendo una novedad teol gica no lo veo como una referencia te rica el puede ser un comienzo de cambios que est n conectados con la iglesia porque hay otros cristianos en la regi n diciendo ac tambi n tenemos los problemas de la tierra de la miseria urbana como en paraguay tambi n tenemos l deres como lugo
2922131 creo que lugo es la encarnaci n de algo que nos puede estar diciendo que estamos pasando la p gina hay que quitar un libro y poner otro est naciendo otra poca como lo dicen te logos como leonardo boff la iglesia necesita ir a la vanguardia del cambio porque si no se quedar en la retaguardia
2922132 la capacidad de la izquierda para atraer a las capas medias y a sus representantes pol ticos
2922133 de una recuperaci n ideol gica ni de un mito liberal capaz de oponerse exitosamente a la revoluci n sino de una utop a
2922134 es democr tica cuando adem s de elecciones partidos pol ticos divisi n de los tres poderes de la rep blica respeto a las voluntades de mayor as y minor as instituye algo m s profundo que es la condici n del propio r gimen pol tico o sea instituye derechos y esa instituci n es una creaci n social de tal manera que la actividad democr tica se realiza como un contrapoder social que determina dirige controla y modifica la acci n estatal y el poder de los gobernantes
2922135 la sociedad democr tica no est fijada a una forma para siempre determinada sino que no cesa de trabajar sus divisiones y diferencias internas de orientarse por las posibilidades objetivas la libertad y de transformarse por la propia praxis por eso la democracia es aquella forma de vida social que crea para s misma un problema que no puede cesar de resolver porque a cada soluci n que encuentra reabre el mismo problema esto es la cuesti n de la participaci n

2922178 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2922201 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2922202 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2922203 what the bolivian people have expressed with their votes today is the consolidation of change

2922247 im going to be in a band no selena gomez stuff

2922249 i basically want to make music that is fun and that parents and kids can jump around to and have a good time to
2922250 i will be singing and im learning drums and playing electric guitar
2922251 i would like to try it and kind of switch it up
2922252 when i do the tour and stuff i would like to do maybe a section on the piano or on guitar or on drums
2922253 you know the jonas boys and people like are my friends so i definitely would not copy or do anything that they did theyre really good obviously at what theyre doing so im going to let them have that but its also just kind of fun to learn things
2922254 its the start of something that can be great weve been waiting for years for this moment
2922255 i dont know how many people were watching the game but it was an honor to play in it
2922256 we were all excited and anxious this game was over the top
2922257 but we have a saying back home that when youre good you play for the name on the front of your jersey instead of the name on the back our guys all play for the name on the front of their jersey

2922260 i thought i was still ok because theres four par 5s over the last 11 holes at ecc and id played them like 10 under for the tournament entering the day
2922261 then i hit a bad drive but made a good swing on my second shot to get it up around the green and made a really nice up and down for birdie then i hit it three feet above the hole on no 9 it was huge when that putt found the middle
2922262 i decided to hit a cut 8 iron below the hole and hit it just perfect
2922263 it left me 10 feet right below the hole and i just knew i was going to make the putt right edge and firm i was really feeling it then eagles make you feel like you can control everything
2922264 i knew i took the lead with the eagle at 10
2922265 id been having a tough time for a while this summer but i gotten it straightened out a couple weeks ago working with my brother jason
2922266 i wasnt going to allow myself to lose after that i wasnt just feeling it as much as i was allowing myself to play by feel like i did when i was younger i had gotten too mechanical for a while i had been trying so hard i was going backward jason got me out of my head
2922267 then he goes 3 2 while im going 6 3 and thats a four stroke swing he did what you have to do to win a golf tournament
2922268 i almost holed out my third shot at 17 and it spins off the green and then paul gentry hit my ball on 18 that extra wait didnt help i was just thinking anything under par might be good enough though
2922269 but i made the bogeys too i was right there on 13 and didnt realize it i was 3 under for the day 1 under for the tournament and had 180 yards to the green with my second shot
2922270 but i snapped it into the hazard and made double bogey that was it i thought it was over at that point because you dont expect kyle to struggle down the stretch
2922271 i cant be angry though i didnt play well for the first three rounds and then had one good one thats golf

2922286 dublin where i used to live and hull could not be more dissimilar
2922287 in dublin there are posters of famous irish writers on every pub wall and postcards of them in every corner shop whereas in hull larkin felt able to do his own thing without anyone bothering him there can be something very liberating about that
2922288 irish poetry may seem a lot more globalised today than in the 1970s but emigration and diaspora have always been at the centre of irish identity anyway vincent buckley is a good example to someone of my generation his book memory ireland is at first glance a strange and even shocking kind of document he visits ireland during the ira hunger strikes of the 1980s and cant understand why irish poets arent writing poems in praise of the hunger strikers i remember this striking me as incredibly out of touch with political reality
2922289 i owe that book to australia in a very real sense
2922290 it begins with a series of sonnets addressed to the gothic 19th century irish poet james clarence mangan one of the principal inspirations for which were a d hopes
2922291 literally hull is one of the flattest cities i know very handy for cycling around though as larkin liked to point out but since you mention derek mahon it was mahon who used to say that the housing estates of protestant belfast represented one of the final frontiers for irish poetry with its very strong ideas about what was and wasnt proper material so for me the thought of making irish poetry out of the industrial estates and backstreet pubs of east yorkshire was a huge challenge
2922292 one of the defining conditions of poetry in the uk today is status anxiety why dont people read poetry like they do fiction is it elitist how can it be more accessible english poet geoffrey hill said that accessibility was all fine and well for a public toilet but not so important if youre writing a poem i prefer to think of it in terms of availability what appealed to me about putting poems on beer mats was that a drinker could either read the poems or ignore them as they saw fit i like the idea of poetry being a part of the landscape of our everyday environment without having to sell itself short
2922293 id like to think im more interested in discovering the places i go to in their own right and hereby authorise anyone in australia who finds me in a state of born again irishness to put me on the first banana boat home

2922365 the point about a single is it needs airplay so you get the album too its the commercial radio factor that decides a and b

2922433 this is clearly the most significant episode of violence in xinjiang for many years
2922434 there is an uptick in militant violence in xinjiang due to the olympics
2922435 the target of etim is actually the beijing olympics but it is very difficult for them to attack the games because of the security measures
2922436 what the latest attacks show is that there is significant coordination of these attacks by etim forces in pakistans border regions
2922437 thats the mistake china has often made in the past they respond with methods that strengthen the hand of the violent by increasing militant sentiment

2922439 weve got 24 hours to sit and have a think sit with the leadership group and address the energy and effort areas
2922440 i think thats probably the surprising thing weve built ourselves up to this point pretty well and been pretty happy with the results weve had
2922441 but to get to this point and to come out here in the fashion we did it was surprising and disappointing

2922500 in other words people who dont need a president can afford to vote for obama because hes exciting represents change etc
2922501 the mother that had to cut back on groceries because of rising gas prices the guy i met who couldnt fill up his gas tank to go on a job search
2922502 obama could use a little more empathy and a little less lecture
2922503 im hoping obama would be a better steward of the economy but im undecided
2922504 i dont like mccain mccain is bush and weve already had this one you know what i mean
2922505 base are independent leaning voters concerned by overspending in washington
2922506 obama can battle mccain in appealing to those kind of voters very well
2922507 mccain hes be a good military leader but i dont know as far as running the economy
2922508 its hard to say at this point whod handle the economy better
2922509 we need change so whoevers going to make the biggest change
2922510 i identified myself and the chaps reaction was what on earth do you think ive done
2922511 the numbers there are just overwhelming just an astounding number of people theyre trying to keep track of
2922512 the met is absolutely brilliant at the big set pieces
2922513 if you cant trust the police in times of crisis then who can you turn to
2922514 the metropolitan police has always struck me as iconic of english society
2922515 it merges absolute professionalism discipline and hard careful work with a kind of organization that creates disorganization services arent sufficiently interconnected
2922516 our disadvantage is that weve got twice the geographic area and weve got some other functions as well were a combination of the nypd and part of the u s secret service and part of the fbi
2922517 it sometimes can be detrimental to some of our responses when we work within these portfolios
2922518 terrorists are actually engaged in serious criminality as well so there is that crossover that takes place and theres often debate around which unit is responsible
2922519 the police need to remain focused on what theyre supposed to be there for which is about making london safer
2922520 twenty per cent of our last academy class was foreign born
2922521 scotland yard is pretty much still lily white they have a different reputation within the population as a result
2922522 we have independent advisers who are community representatives jewish turkish black faith lesbian gay bisexual transgender
2922523 policing is like being on a river bank next to a fast flowing stream
2922524 you have the choice of pulling them out of the water or going upstream to find out whos throwing them in theres a lot of debate about where is the limit of the police mandate because we could go very far upstream

2922571 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2922572 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2922573 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2922574 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2922575 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2922576 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2922577 its the already high water bills in the south west that have driven the popularity of water meters here
2922578 the average metered household pays just under 400 a year while the average household still working off rateable value pays getting on for 700 south west waters draft five year business plan will say that gaps likely to widen further as the number of switchers grows
2922579 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2922580 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2922581 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2922582 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2922583 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2922584 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2922585 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2922586 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2922587 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2922588 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2922589 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2922590 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2922591 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2922592 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2922593 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2922594 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2922595 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2922596 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2922597 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2922598 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2922599 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2922600 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2922601 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2922602 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2922603 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2922604 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2922605 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2922606 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2922607 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2922608 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2922609 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2922610 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2922611 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2922612 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2922613 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2922614 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2922615 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2922616 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2922617 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2922618 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2922619 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2922620 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2922621 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2922622 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2922623 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2922624 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2922625 has dissolved his management arrangement with benny medina and has re engaged his mother jonnetta patton as his manager
2922626 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2922627 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2922628 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2922629 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2922630 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2922631 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2922632 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2922633 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2922634 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2922635 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2922636 and then you cross the border and think these people need some help here
2922637 midler herself needed none in fine voice and especially sharp humor friday though it should be noted the concert began a shameless half hour late
2922638 we are in a tough pool and have to win every game so i am definitely happy to win this one
2922639 i had barely settled into my coaching box when we scored the first goal it showed we were not nervous
2922640 i cant be happy when we missed so many goals it is unacceptable at the start of the tournament we had seven penalty corners and wasted all of them
2922641 it makes it difficult for us now but we will fight all the way
2922642 i am not surprised we had problems getting into the game at the start
2922643 we have a young team and for many of them it is their first olympics so a bit of nervousness was natural but once we settled down we just got better and better
2922644 maye we should not have lost by such a big margin but this is the first time they are playing at the
2922645 the u n secretary general is profoundly concerned over mounting tensions in the abkhaz zone of conflict
2922646 precision strikes against military infrastructure in order to prevent georgian aircraft and military attack on our peacekeepers
2922647 we want to force the georgian leadership to peace and what we see right now on the ground is that georgian troops not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armor and increased attacks on tskhinvali
2922648 my administration has been engaged with both sides of this trying to get a ceasefire
2922649 for his governments restraint offers of cease fire and disengagement of georgian forces from the zone of conflict in the south ossetian region of the country
2922650 the vice president told president saakashvili that russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community

2922653 do you ever imagine how easier your life would be if you werent a faggot
2922654 yes but youre a guy you like other guys that makes a banana in a fruit salad
2922655 im a woman a lady who desires the company of men
2922656 a woman that needs to shave her face regularly look im not twisting your nipples on the issue of faggotory im merely questioning what you think life would be like if you were actually born a woman
2922657 i dont know have never given it much thought why are you asking me such a stupid
2922658 my profession is far more simple than i make it out to be someone dies horribly and i come and clean it up trauma scene sanitation yay me im a nanny for dead people but do you know how many other people are involved when a person dies take a loner for example the type than people dont know is dead until the smell of their rotting body pushes into the hallways of the adjoined apartment block the neighbour reports it the police investigate the ambulance removes the body the landlord contacts us and we restore it good as new people die every day it happens now take for example a double homicide suicide out in the countryside that isnt reported for months similar process
2922659 you ever think that this was never meant to be a perfect world a perfect life a perfect anything you remove crime you remove the police you remove illness and disease you remove medical care accidents dont happen and neither does the fire department we all get along and the armies of the world dissolve then what what exactly are we meant to do in a perfect world there might have been a point where we were meant to get it right but it just feels like were at a point of no return
2922660 your worship i would like to submit a toxicology report to the court it is genuine and any questions of its authenticity can be referred to my doctor one dr sean williams of great repute and stature he is a big man tall and handsome straight teeth the kind of man id bring home to fuck my sister
2922661 mr winters this report is an analysis of you is it not
2922662 it is indeed you will see there that i am positive for cocaine amphetamines mdma weed and lsd though i dont recall consuming the acid mustve been a hell of a trip i also have sedatives pain killers barbiturates opiates and alcohol shit i even have traces of motion sickness tablets
2922663 your worship im a drug addict plain and simple i sanitise traumatic scenes of carnage for a living and when im not doing that im getting high im drunk right now and i have a handful of uppers and downers in my pocket there is no doubt im a train wreck recent records alone show that i had a speed induced heart attack that lead to a car accident im an idiot an addict but im no murderer just a foolish young man caught between coincidence and loss
2922664 the oxycodone that you obtained from the pharmacist was prescribed to you by your physician
2922665 thats correct the car accident left me in quite a bit of pain and dr williams diligently explained to me what would happen if i were to have the pain killing medicine interact with say lsd probably why i cant remember shit about that episode look heres the deal i lost my best friend to suicide and her daughter lost her mother but gained a father namely me i knew her mother for years and never once did she mention that id fathered a child with her which is still a questionable fact so forgive my sporadic drug use but ive got a lot shit on plate at the moment
2922666 you dont see the irony in using drugs to clear me of drugs
2922667 imagine youre a fireman turning up to a burning building its too late to do anything all you can do is watch it burn you have two options go into rehab or kill it with fire
2922668 i will have your polluted blood transfused with fresh blood and in the process inject a very long lasting opiate blocker this means that even if you do shoot any kind of opiate into your system you will likely overdose before you feel a thing
2922669 in my many years practising ive never had to suggest it but then again ive never met someone so toxic you need to understand the risks cody you may very well die you may not wake up something may go wrong this is a very delicate procedure that is rarely put to use and there is no guarantee you wont still have to endure the symptoms of withdrawal even while youre unconscious

2922672 that was fantastic it wasnt just about the games it was what happened around the games that was really cool
2922673 i think you will expect a lot right through that is the beauty of this competition
2922674 everyone can beat everyone on their day it has really made this competition there are some really good match ups and i think that is good for the game
2922675 i think it is still doing its job in providing for the next group of players coming through
2922676 obviously we have lost a lot of experienced players and that makes the competition probably not as good as it has been in that sense because the quality of players has changed
2922677 the word staycation can be wonderfully appealing in a city like san diego there are so many things to do here and we are just a short drive from the l a orange county and inland empire areas we have it all here at the hard rock hotel including luxury accommodations awesome restaurants a spa nightlife and an ideal location its everything you would fly to places like vegas or miami to experience

2922684 la parte reazionaria del discorso del comico lo sfott c una grande differenza fra il teatro sfott e il teatro di satira il teatro di satira sempre morale basti pensare al timore al panico che hanno avuto sempre i potenti davanti ai problemi della satira perch la satira in molti casi ha determinato la presa di coscienza della gente soprattutto delle classi inferiori ha fatto capire di avere il potere di ribaltare le situazioni di avere il coraggio quindi temuta qual la differenza che esiste fra fare satira e fare sfott allora posso dire a un giovane attento che giocare esclusivamente sulla pura caricatura legata a un personaggio anche a un uomo politico che grasso piccolo magro magari ha la gobba magari si intartaglia non realizza niente questo fa fare soltanto una risata fine a se stessa ma se non c la dimensione morale se tu attraverso la satira non riesci a far capire il significato opposto delle banalit dellovvio dellipocrisia soprattutto e della violenza che ogni potere esprime e porta addosso ai minori ebbene il tuo ridere vuoto proprio lo sghignazzo ventrale e non quello dello stomaco e dei polmoni
2922685 the well has now been completed as a potential futureproducer
2922686 so far there are still few industries less affected to the extent than other industries
2922687 but as china move up the value added chain and continue to offer attractive price points imports growth rates which we now have seen may in the near term could grow at a more rapid pace
2922688 this will not be a cakewalk for us we have very strong competitors
2922689 but i believe with the caliber of the staff we have that we will be successful at the end of the day in producing for this country the vaccine we need
2922690 we are confident that our vaccine is a leading candidate to be selected as an advanced anthrax vaccine our company is proud of our proven track record of delivering critical biodefense countermeasures to the u s government
2922691 were not able to say who actually provided a proposal other than that we did have multiple offers and they look pretty good
2922692 they will be evaluated for technical merit over the next several weeks then we will enter into negotiations and were looking toward contracts by the fall
2922693 so if one doesnt make it others will still be going forward
2922694 and ultimately we would like to have enough for 300 million people
2922695 were buying all that they can make until we have more vaccines available
2922696 you have to keep track of everyone and make sure theyre receiving all the doses theyre supposed to its not what youd call the optimum vaccine strategy
2922697 it is a single protein a recombinant version of the rpa consequently it works with only three doses instead of six and those three doses can be given over 60 days instead of 180 days

2922718 this particular air force exercise is important because india is included among some very important allies
2922719 this is definitely an extension of an arc that has been mapped out since 2000 and it really signifies that what india and the united states have is a strategic relationship
2922720 pyongyang through its state run news agency the korean central news agency has consistently and passionately criticized such ventures accusing the united states of harboring hostile intentions toward north korea
2922721 beijing would likely remain reticent about such training since it does not see itself as directly and imminently affected by such activities

2922762 after concerns from local residents about the environmental impact of lighting columns a decision was made to remove them
2922763 i have had several emails letters and phone calls about the lights and while people have queried the cost most communications have complimented the council on the swift action and removal of the street lamps
2922764 at the time we accepted that there would inevitably be extra cost involved in the removal of the columns however we felt it was a price worth paying to maintain good relationships with our residents the columns are being re used elsewhere in the project
2922765 we must stress that we carried out the work with the very best intentions of improving road safety and the fear of crime and putting lighting into an area that has increased pedestrian usage at night
2922766 the money could have been used to improve the lower promenade instead of unnecessary street lamps the residents were not consulted about them they just appeared one day
2922767 everyone was appalled by what happened we really could not believe they could do such a thing to the stray

2922769 unfortunately it means you taking the rap for the associates who you have not named they are too cowardly to stand up and say we were involved

2922784 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
2922785 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2922786 even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
2922787 unlike big time soul crooners of the time he sang in a calm cool style prefacing songs with spoken
2922788 who is the man that would risk his neck for his brother man

2922791 its definitely a rest of my life kind of thing
2922792 i feel good about winning nay great and now i feel the weight of my sisters and brothers of air on my shoulders

2922795 it really fueled me i hope i gave them back what they gave me it was nothing short of awesome and im proud to stand in the shadow of hot lixx

2922824 i sincerely hope my medal changes the face of indias olympic sports
2922825 for me life will go on as usual but i sincerely hope olympic sports get a leg up its not a priority back home and i hope more focus is paid to these events

2922834 thats the best ive ever done in my whole life
2922835 our solid performance reported at the end of the first quarter has continued throughout the first half of the financial year
2922836 we have seen a strong operational performance on the outsourcing contracts and the direct property investments portfolio and this has left us in a good cash position at the end of the first half
2922837 especially at a time like this when hugh has put in so much time and effort into getting us to this point our hearts and our thoughts and our prayers go out to their family
2922838 hes sorely missed on the sideline by the players the coaches and myself
2922839 id much rather be sitting on the bench telling him what i think he should be doing and having him say i dont think so rather than where i am right now

2922841 we send a special thank you to the people of beijing the people of new zealand and of course the people of america we have been lifted up by the outpouring of support and love weve received from around the world
2922842 the long list of people who have offered their assistance kind words and prayers to us has been incredible
2922843 this letter cannot do justice in acknowledging the love and support weve felt
2922844 he gave us a little bit of reassurance to move on
2922845 to try to focus on what we came here to do weve all invested so much of our lives as he has it was great to hear his voice we just have to try to trust what he says

2922850 the way we think about media and influence companies are still struggling to find effective metrics for deciding who are the influential players
2922851 to enhance relationships improve the reputation of their businesses drive customer awareness of their online activities and solicit customer comments and feedback
2922852 standard internet measures like search engine ranking and website traffic as being more useful in determining their organizations own influence than audience awareness or bottom line results the popularity of the quantitative criteria was particularly intriguing because the benefits of conversation marketing have been widely touted to be brand awareness and customer satisfaction

2922892 no question what happens today the senate vote will be fresh on the minds of our leaders

2922919 i hit a good tee shot and good second shot which i thought was going to give me a good birdie chance at 18 and i messed up the bunker shot

2922929 grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and the bombing outside of south ossetia
2922930 my administration has been engaged with both sides in this trying to get a cease fire
2922931 100 focused on solving this peacefully we respect georgias territorial integrity and we expect russia to do the same
2922932 would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2922933 this situation could be resolved peacefully so they have held that door open
2922934 this statement ambassador is absolutely unacceptable particularly from the lips of the permanent representative of a country whose actions we are aware of including with regard to civilian populations in iraq afghanistan and serbia
2922935 i see the country full of confrontations i hope we find a way to be together

2922939 bob bowman had said that the french team was saying some stuff talking a little bit of trash
2922940 it fired me up more than anything else we were all fired up
2922941 before the race we all knew the way the french had swum in the prelims that when they added their best two guys it was going to be a tight race they had talked a lot about it and we would just rather do it in the pool they pulled that time off without their best two guys
2922942 i knew it was going to come down to the end and i was hoping to be ahead but i never lost hope
2922943 i dont know how i was able to take it back that fast because ive never been able to come anywhere near that for the last 50
2922944 i gave it everything i had possibly but they got me on the end i feel like i should have got my hand on the wall first
2922945 its just been a really tough year for me obviously losing the 200 breaststroke at trials kind of affects your confidence a little bit i felt good going into the race tonight but obviously everybody brought their a game everybody swam really really well those times are the top times in the world this year
2922946 i kept it in broken english so that he could understand me
2922947 the price he paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2922948 and now he embraces the failed bush policies over the last eight years politics that helped break washington in the first place and that doesnt exactly meet my definition of a maverick
2922949 it was always going to have to be a part of our campaign for the general election
2922950 sure hes been in washington 26 years but hes always been a reformer always worked across party lines sacrificed his own political interests to do so
2922951 so we were always going to have to tell that narrative because some people know it but not everybody
2922952 he can point to areas where he broke with the bush administration where he broke with his own party
2922953 that part of the maverick image probably isnt going away
2922954 the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008
2922955 john mccain has changed hes taken the low road leveling false negative and misleading attacks against barack obama

2922959 die situasie is soms s oorweldigend dat ons nie weet wat om aan misdaad te doen nie ons het die afgelope 15 jaar nie noodwendig die regte besluite geneem of hulpbronne doeltreffend ontplooi nie ons moet nou op ons tande byt
2922960 dit sal tien jaar duur net om die agterstand in toksikologiese ontledings uit te wis
2922961 dit beteken net 15 van die polisie se totale werkmag fokus daarop om misdaad op te los di stelsel ly aan n gebrek aan suurstof en is die nagevolg van onvoldoende beleidsbesluite
2922962 dit sal die land tot 300 keer minder kos om di mense se borgtoggeld te betaal as om hulle in die tronk te hou
2922963 dit bogenoemde statistieke toon hoe disfunksioneel ons strafregstelsel is ons het nie genoeg speurders om misdaad te ondersoek nie en die howe is ondoeltreffend
2922964 die stryd teen misdaad is hopeloos verlam deur verkeerde beleidsbesluite onprofessionele personeellede en n reuse gebrek aan hulpbronne en aanspreeklikheid die strafregstelsel is ondoeltreffend

2923099 how do you feel about what you did would you do it again under similar circumstances
2923100 ive thought about this a lot being almost 60 its impossible to not have lots and lots of regrets about lots and lots of things but the question of did we do something that was horrendous awful i dont think so i think what we did was to respond to a situation that was unconscionable
2923101 they served on a board together when obama was a state senator ayres donated 200 to obamas campaign in 2001 they sat on a panel together in 2002 called to be introduced to some of the more influential liberals in the area by the state senator he was preparing to succeed alice palmer
2923102 the difference here is that bill ayers hosted an event for senator obama at his home when he was running for state senator
2923103 i can tell you that neither linda evans or susan rosenberg hosted an event for her and i think thats why the question becomes relevant
2923104 im sometimes asked if i regret anything i did to oppose the war in viet nam and i say no i dont regret anything i did to try to stop the slaughter of millions of human beings by my own government
2923105 secret law and the threat to democratic and accountable government
2923106 secret law and the threat to democratic and accountable government
2923107 no one disputes a presidents ability to withdraw or revise an executive order
2923108 but modifying or even throwing out a published executive order without any public notice is a way of secretly changing the law and since the executive order stays on the books congress and the public are misled about what the real law is this bill is an important step toward stemming the growth of secret law in the executive branch
2923109 the bush administrations relentless efforts to conduct government in secret have undermined the rule of law and too often betrayed the trust of the american people
2923110 this measure will help restore the rule of law disciplined by the balance of power established under the constitution
2923111 secret law and the threat to democratic and accountable government
2923112 secret law and the threat to democratic and accountable government
2923113 more than any other administration in recent history this administration has a penchant for secrecy
2923114 these examples are the topic of much discussion and concern and appropriately so
2923115 the notion of secret law has been described in court opinions and law treatises as repugnant and an abomination
2923116 the recent release of the march 2003 john yoo torture memorandum has shone a sobering light on this practice
2923117 this entire memorandum was classified and withheld from congress and the public for years on the claim that it contained information that could not be disclosed without harming national security
2923118 another body of secret law is the controlling interpretations of the foreign intelligence surveillance act that are issued by the foreign intelligence surveillance court
2923119 these interpretations are as much a part of this countrys surveillance law as the statute itself
2923120 the administrations shroud of secrecy extends to agency rules and executive pronouncements such as executive orders that carry the force of law
2923121 now none of us disputes that a president can withdraw or revise an executive order at any time thats every presidents prerogative
2923122 and that gets us to the heart of the problem
2923123 secret law and the threat to democratic and accountable government
2923124 they thought they were free the germans 1933 1945 university of chicago press
2923125 was the ever widening gap after1933 between the government and the people
2923126 this separation of government from people this widening of the gap took place so gradually and so insensibly each step disguised perhaps not even intentionally as a temporary emergency measure or associated with true patriotic allegiance or with real social purposes
2923127 you will understand me when i say that my middle high german was my life
2923128 one had no time to think there was so much going on
2923129 the dictatorship and the whole process of its coming into being was above all diverting
2923130 to live in this process is absolutely not to be able to notice it please try to believe me unless one has a much greater degree of political awareness acuity than most of us had ever had occasion to develop
2923131 how is this to be avoided among ordinary men even highly educated ordinary men frankly i do not know
2923132 uncertainty is a very important factor and instead of decreasing as time goes on it grows
2923133 but the one great shocking occasion when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you never comes
2923134 and one day too late your principles if you were ever sensible of them all rush in upon you
2923135 43 i think it was a jew was tried before him in a case involving but only incidentally relations with an
2923136 resistance protest criticism complaint all carried with them a multiplied likelihood of the greatest punishment mere lack of enthusiasm or failure to show it in public was defeatism you assumed that there were lists of those who would be dealt with later after the victory goebbels was very clever here too he continually promised a victory orgy to take care of those who thought that their treasonable attitude had escaped notice and he meant it that was not just propaganda and that was enough to put an end to all uncertainty
2923137 once the war began the government could do anything necessary to win it so it was with the final solution of the jewish problem which the nazis always talked about but never dared undertake not even the nazis until war and its necessities gave them the knowledge that they could get away with it

2923145 it also said that if all points are met with jammu will still feel discontent since their is a political disparity
2923146 the god who holds you over the pit of hell much as one holds a spider or some loathsome insect over the flame abhors you and is dreadfully provoked
2923147 therefore god has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy and whom he wants to he hardens

2923149 today was so different from the other day when we played in the heat instead it was a battle against humidity but thats the magic of this sport you have to change your game all the time
2923150 its hard to keep your concentration when all this is going on we just try to hang out with our friends and talk about other stuff keep away from the news its very sad theres a war during the olympic truce
2923151 me gustar a dedicar m s tiempo a mi hija jubilarme vivir mi vida como el resto de las personas porque el deporte es una vida dif cil muy sacrificada no es la vida real lo dejo s hoy lo dejo
2923152 me gustar a nadar m s r pido pero el tiempo que he logrado es bueno he podido nadar 1 00 50 por la ma ana y no es lo mismo un europeo que unos juegos ol mpicos en pek n hay un nivel muy alto y al principio de la temporada pensaba que iba a ser muy complicado clasificarme para los juegos siempre hablo de lo que me gustar a lograr era muy complicado llegar a la final porque ten a que fallar mucha gente pero sacando mi marca he acabado bastante contenta
2923153 estar toda la temporada por debajo del 1 minuto y 1 segundo es estar a un alto nivel
2923154 hay mucha gente que se ha quedado fuera de las semifinales o de la final por reservarse la gente est tan asustada que nada muy r pido en las eliminatorias y en las semifinales despu s del europeo tuve una peque a lesi n en el hombro y sigo teniendo molestias eso me ha hecho cambiar un poco la t cnica y ahora no voy tan suelta

2923158 these people especially women have done a great job in feeding us and earning the country foreign exchange we should help them modernise their activities to increase their productivity
2923159 i always hear some farmers lamenting that they are jobless farming is good and we should take pride in it
2923160 we appeal to those who trained in agriculture to become farmers
2923161 the rest of the team needs to start playing in a way that will bring them success
2923162 im sure they will do well but we have to look at the quality of the service we have to support them better
2923163 long been skeptical of including labor and environmental rules in trade deals
2923164 web sites have begun to accept that people want more ways to interact with them than by just clicking around and filling in forms
2923165 its about trying to stay relevant as people get used to traveling through a more fluid web
2923166 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
2923167 it was an opportunity to go over to china and do something that has probably not been done in the past go to china and do some comedy
2923168 there were days when we got promising news and days when we got not so encouraging news
2923169 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
2923170 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
2923171 there were moments where you were just being watched very closely
2923172 we still did what we wanted to do but i was hurrying it up saying come on come on lets go it was a subconscious thing
2923173 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2923174 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2923175 and i wanted zac efron but you know what everyones going to have to live with a little bit of disappointment

2923179 as long as any profits go to charity it is fine it has been done by other people before
2923180 im quite confident that i could raise 250 000 in profit to give to charity
2923181 this can make a life changing difference to someone i really hope it goes to a struggling family who really need it
2923182 whoever wins this will become very well off overnight i hope it will bring a lot of joy to someone and to the charity i have chosen to donate the profits to
2923183 you know love dont mean nothing really im not a fan of love people fall in and out of love every day let the lights go off and see how much they love you dont let anything be on that table at 5 oclock in the evening and see how much she loves you let that car keep breaking down and see how much she loves you i really believe out of 27 years of being with my wife that we went through that transition that we like each other and i think thats the most important thing i truly like her shes my friend you know and i wouldnt trade her for nothing in the world
2923184 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2923185 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
2923186 the main source of support for the u s economy in recent quarters has been the strength of net exports
2923187 but the world economy has fallen off the edge of a cliff
2923188 im really proud of her adlington im proud of both of them to be able to watch an olympic gold medal for great britain
2923189 the medal around my neck was my motivation i couldnt see anyone past katie
2923190 i didnt know what was going on over that side of the pool so i saw katie and it was just lets try and catch her and keep with her and thats what i did
2923191 i dont think either of us expected it especially two british girls on the podium and especially gold and bronze
2923192 that race was just completely different we did go slower than we did last night in the heats and it was just about racing and we did that
2923193 i dont think either of us are natural front end swimmers we dont do the 100 free so we are just naturally suited to the back end of the race i dont think either of us panics if in the first 100 were a little bit behind
2923194 its a great result to get on the podium its just amazing im so happy for both of us and its great for british swimming
2923195 theres different swimmers the 800 is completely different event but im really confident going into it and its just about the next two days and getting some recovery and rest and getting ready for it
2923196 this is definitely the best british team weve ever had and we just keeping getting stronger and stronger and weve proved that were a nation to look out for now
2923197 perhaps after italy france and mexico break through this barrier we could consider putting southern american barbecue on the table
2923198 although humans have been cooking meat in some form or fashion since the taming of fire in the american south it has truly become an art form
2923199 yes french cuisine has made a very important contribution to the world of gastronomy but it is not fair to say it is the only cuisine that is important nor is it fair to say that one countrys food is better than anothers
2923200 with 166 food specialties recognized by the european union italy clearly beats france in second place with 156
2923201 although frances regional cuisines are blurring the sad reality is that virtually all the cuisines on earth are also endangered
2923202 i hope that unesco some day will make people more aware of how national and regional cuisines around the globe are being bastardized
2923203 weve come a long way from where we started just offering an inventory of about 5 000 hotels based in asia then we expanded those numbers to 33 000 and finally to over 80 000 to include hotels across the world were so excited that our success has led us to add even more hotels across the world to our inventory making travel to just about anywhere in the world possible with our site

2923215 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2923216 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a cease fire and termination of hostilities
2923217 not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armor and increased attacks on tskhinvali

2923228 kom nou mee naar binnen we hoeven niks te doen
2923229 je hebt toch niks aan me dus ik kan net zo goed gaan
2923230 ik hou van je en ik wil graag weten wat er in je mooie hoofdje omgaat
2923231 al sinds de dag dat ik je ken voel ik dat er iets is
2923232 ik houd van je en ik wil bij je blijven maar je maakt het me soms zo verdomd moeilijk vertel me alsjeblieft wat er gebeurd is
2923233 kom binnen lieverd ik heb al thee voor ons gezet
2923234 het spijt me zo lieve aafke maar ik moet vandaag helaas afscheid van je nemen
2923235 ik wil niets liever dan onze vriendschap voortzetten maar ik trek het financiel niet meer god wat schaam ik me om dit toe te geven
2923236 ik zou het allemaal niet zo erg hebben gevonden maar we blijken zelfs geen geld meer te hebben voor kerstcadeautjes voor onze kleinkinderen
2923237 aafke je bent zo lief helaas zal het echter niet werken als je het geld naar me overboekt zal de bank het meteen inhouden onze schulden zijn te groot geworden
2923238 is er dan geen enkele oplossing ik wil je niet kwijt annie
2923239 er is misschien wel een oplossing maar dan vraag ik wel heel veel van je
2923240 als we nou samen naar de bank gaan en jij geeft me contant geld dat hoeft natuurlijk niemand te weten dan koop ik een nieuwe auto en kan onze bijzondere vriendschap blijven bestaan
2923241 ellen is erachter gekomen dat ook rogier voor haar is gevallen
2923242 die meid is echt losgeslagen en ze heeft geen enkel respect voor het huwelijk
2923243 het wordt tijd dat we ingrijpen dit kan zo niet langer
2923244 wij staan niet langer toe dat die slet er met onze kerels vandoor gaat ze helemaal gek maakt om ze daarna weer af te danken
2923245 mijn rudolf is nog maar een schaduw van de man waar ik mee trouwde zij heeft hem tot waanzin gedreven en nu hij bij me terug is verwacht hij van mij dat ik me wat sexier ga kleden
2923246 mijn felix kwam met hangende pootjes bij me terug hij zag toch wel in dat zij niet alles was
2923247 ik heb hem laten boeten voor zijn fout geloof me hij zal het echt nooit meer in zijn hoofd halen om achter mijn rug om met een ander te scharrelen
2923248 ja sorry ik bemoei me natuurlijk weer eens met zaken die me niks aangaan maar ik zag je daar liggen en je leek zo down
2923249 je hebt zeker ruzie met je vriendje daar kon ik ook altijd zo wanhopig van worden nog steeds eigenlijk mannen
2923250 hier droog je tranen geen vent is het waard dat je om hem huilt
2923251 nou dat jij alle mannen in het dorp gek maakt enzo
2923252 lieve lieve lisa je moet niet alles geloven wat ze zeggen er zitten altijd meer kanten aan een verhaal later als je groot bent zul me wel begrijpen
2923253 ik moet weer verder lisa laat je niet gek maken
2923254 kom op prinses ik wil graag weten waar mijn meisje zich mee bezighoudt
2923255 felix laat dat kind toch ze heeft nou eenmaal de leeftijd dat ze niet meer alles met haar papa wil delen
2923256 lisa je vader heeft vanavond een vergadering en ik moet ook weg dus annet komt vanavond op je passen
2923257 mag ik dan wel op jullie kamer televisie kijken annet kijkt alleen maar stomme programmas
2923258 maar je gaat wel gewoon om negen uur naar je eigen bed
2923259 je weet waar de chips liggen frisdrank staat in de koelkast neem gerust waar je zin in hebt maar stuur mij wel om negen uur naar bed
2923260 ze is verdwenen gisterenavond moest ze werken in de videotheek maar daar is ze nooit aangekomen ze hebben haar fiets gevonden in de bosjes maar van claire ontbreekt elk spoor ik weet het omdat mijn vader bij de politie werkt
2923261 he lisa zo zie ik je nooit en zo ineens twee keer op een dag
2923262 zit dat vriendje van je je nou nog steeds dwars ik zei vanmiddag toch al dat geen vent dat waard is
2923263 het spijt me claire maar ik moest wel ik kon toch niet toestaan dat je ons gezin naar de verdommenis zou helpen papa hoort gewoon bij ons
2923264 well i hope youre kicking yourself in the ass i would like to have seen that
2923265 well i guess youre not likely to load anything embarrassing on you tube anytime soon
2923266 the pictures taken by me are not worse than those by the professionals because i know the most charming beijing 20 years ago
2923267 en je minder favoriete merk was ook uitverkocht ze hadden alleen nog houtkorrels
2923268 i think everyone knows what my feelings for this club are and i consider it a great honour and a big challenge to bring in exciting young players both from other clubs and through an already impressive scouting network
2923269 i have vast experience and a strong belief in how the game should be played a belief that i am delighted to say owen coyle shares
2923270 you dont get the finished article with youth or even at 14 15 or 16 years of age but i think you can still see players attitudes to the game and how they handle disappointment
2923271 if we can identify the right type of player then i feel we can only help take the club to the next level
2923272 martin will look at all age groups of youngsters from five through to mid teens
2923273 now that we are building up links with america northern ireland and other countries it will be his role to uncover the players for tomorrow
2923274 although we have full time staff in there and a wide network of scouts we believe martins expertise will be invaluable
2923275 the approach to youth development in the modern era is far different than it was perhaps 25 years ago when in many way burnley was a role model
2923276 the club is reacting to that and while we are making a 2 5m investment in our gawthorpe training facility we also need a model for the future
2923277 we are in talks and thats where we stand at the moment
2923278 im settled here so it is just down to myself and the club im very positive about it so hopefully we can get something tied up by the start of the season
2923279 brad friedel has been an excellent goalkeeper at this football club and people have been saying to me how are you going to fill his boots
2923280 but im not coming here to be brad friedel im coming here to be paul robinson and i want to show people what i can do
2923281 its no secret i had a rough ride for six months at tottenham but i never doubted my own ability
2923282 certain situations didnt work out ideally for me but this is a fresh start for me and im just looking forward to it
2923283 i dont think theres anything that can hurt me any more i can play without fear
2923284 everybody has a dip in confidence and form and circumstances didnt help last year
2923285 but its helped me develop as a player and as a person ive had everything from winning the carling cup to being left out of the team in the space of five to six weeks and the stuff with england as well
2923286 i was ready for a new start and a new challenge this move has helped me find the fire and ambition that i knew i had but maybe drained out of me over last season not by choice
2923287 ive still got things to prove i want to start playing well on a consistent level and get back in the england team im 28 and ive got 42 caps and i intend to add to those
2923288 i was linked with a lot of clubs this summer but as soon as blackburn were interested i knew where i was going this is great club and i intend to be here for a long time
2923289 i think this is a great opportunity for me and if you look at the league blackburn finished higher than tottenham last season
2923290 go back and tell your company that you cant change your pricing whenever you gosh darn thats not really how i said it feel like it you need to post you rates customers dont trust you
2923291 if you want to be ready for 2010 you have a lot of work to do let me tell you
2923292 this isnt a charity youre running a business you need to look out for your customers because they are your bread and butter

2923294 the rest land transfer its revocation and everything else be treated as null and void
2923295 we are working on a solution which will resolve the issue amicably and i am sure we will do that soon
2923296 the union home minister did respond to the issue of muslims being targeted in jammu and the economic blockade he assured that law and order would be strictly maintained to prevent communal violence regarding the economic blockade he patil said that the government would take all necessary steps to keep the highway open at all costs not only between jammu and srinagar but beyond jammu even in punjab
2923297 we are laying emphasis on the supply of essential commodities like medicine mutton and other stuff in kashmir and we will make sure that the road is not blocked
2923298 we will not let fruit growers suffer losses we will take all necessary steps if they are unable to send their fruits to the market we will ask people in the government to buy it from them here the police and the crpf will buy it or we will buy it and give it to school children
2923299 if the losses still continue we will pay them compensation as we do in other parts of the country
2923300 this is what everybody has told me from jammu to here and it is a good thing
2923301 we will have to look for a solution for the land issue a solution which will not have any negative impact on kashmir or jammu
2923302 those opposed to the amarnath land transfer were questioning jammu and kashmirs status as an integral part of the country
2923303 jammu and kashmir is an integral part of india whoever raises questions on this issue will have to pay for it
2923304 this is not a question of amarnath or a shrine alone they are saying it is okay that you have alloted land for vaishno devi in jammu but how can you allot land in kashmir
2923305 shyama prasad mookerjee during his struggle 55 years ago for cancelling the visa system for those visiting the state had promised people that he would either get the permit system abolished or sacrifice his life we seem to have turned a full circle today
2923306 now the population of the bangladeshi migrants has reached to about threerore the bjp is of the view that in the whole of northeast a national register of citizen should be created and create identity cards for them the indian government should speak to its bangladeshi counterpart to form a process to detect the illegal migrants and deport them
2923307 i hope it will not be done and it should not be allowed they should not take that route it is wrong for them and us also
2923308 yatra was not affected by the protests and no harm was done to any yatri in kashmir
2923309 otherwise witnessed an erosion in its credibility in recent years
2923310 loss to the tourism industry which had witnessed an unprecedented arrival of tourists prior to the crisis
2923311 the disruption of the national highway in jammu and punjab should not be repeated
2923312 safe passage must be provided to merchandise and transporters moving from the valley to the rest of country and vice versa
2923313 exploited by both factions of the hurriyat there will be an attempt to march to muzaffarabad by fruit growers which may lead to further complications besides attempts by separatists to catch attention of the international media
2923314 land revocation order has hurt the religious sentiments of the hindus of the state the agitation has assumed the dimension of a mass movement manifestation of perceived discrimination with the jammu region for the last 60 years
2923315 there is a very urgent need to find some solution to the vexed issue which will be acceptable to the people of both the regions
2923316 follow the detailed programme given by the hurriyat sponsored action committee against land transfer

2923522 ya karena sebetulnya prangko bekas lebih butuh perawatan yang sedikit khusus dibandingkan dengan yang baru tapi sama saja karena keduanya juga harus dirawat sebaik baiknya mari kita lanjutkan kalau prangko yang masih baru dan yang belum terpotong potong sebaiknya dilapisi dengan plastik pembungkus dulu baru diletakkan dalam album tapi sebaiknya prangko yang baru dan prangko yang bekas diletakkan dalam album yang terpisah nak
2923523 untuk prangko yang bekas ada baiknya kita rendam dulu prangko itu dalam air dan diamkan prangko itu hingga bagian belakang prangko yang tertempel oleh kertas terlepas setelah lepas angkat prangko itu lalu letakkan diatas koran
2923524 eitts tapi kita juga harus hati hati dalam melakukan langkah yang tadi karena pada saat itu prangko akan sangat mudah robek dan ingat bagian yang diletakkan kekoran itu hanyalah bagian bawah prangko yang tadinya tertempel kertas amplop lalu pastikan prangko tersebut tidak basah alias kering
2923525 kalau prangko itu disimpan dalam keadaan basah otomatis bagian yang basah tadi bisa mendatangkan jamur dan jamur itu akan mudah menyebar ke prangko yang lain sehingga koleksi prangkomu bisa rusak terakhir yang perlu diingat taruhlah album prangkomu itu pada tempat yang kering dan terjaga dan jangan di tempat yang lembap ada pertanyaan

2923859 from that day on daddy said he wouldnt play games in
2923860 so whatever happened my father was not proud of he didnt want to discuss it
2923861 not just because he was an all america football player daddy left a modest estate but mother was very very comfortable we always lived comfortably but he took care of my mother me and my family
2923862 i heard my father say many times if the only thing his obituary said was that he was an all america football player then the last 40 years of his life were in vain
2923863 hopefully you have discovered that he was a good citizen and a good businessman

2923881 my eyes theyre not natural did you see the teacher when i stated my name
2923882 were all different the ministry guarantees our differences when were born
2923883 for not seeing me as so different for not being afraid
2923884 it was okay i wonder what the stars look like
2923885 they told us havent you studied a star before theyre just gases
2923886 i mean from space i wonder what they look like in space
2923887 i would like to travel some day i want to see what the stars look like in person not just in the visuals
2923888 the only people who see stars in person are the military they would never let a learner travel from world to world what would be the point we can see anything we want on other worlds because of the nets and the other learners i even had a class once where we shared a lesson with another world
2923889 youre right of course but id still like to see the stars like the captains do it would be beautiful
2923890 can i help you oh hi tommy i wasnt expecting you this soon
2923891 no problem no problem i got your email just a bit ago but ive got the form around here somewhere
2923892 ah yes its been in my family for many generations
2923893 tell me tom i remember you doing quite well in my class whats your major
2923894 dont get me wrong tom i have nothing against it its just not a very career oriented major now is it
2923895 no i know what youre thinking listen this might sound a bit odd but what do you know about time travel
2923896 i suppose it would have to start on the assumption that time is a banner that can be left behind and then rejoined
2923897 um i dont know why are we talking about this
2923898 would you like to know what i think about it tom
2923899 im sure youve read a couple sci fi novels in your short life yes
2923900 which theory do you subscribe to in literary temporal theory then do you believe that we can go back in time and change things or do you believe that you can only travel in one direction what do you accept as rationalization in literature for stories about time travel
2923901 i suppose ive never gotten why people believe that you can go back in time and affect things i mean if michael j fox went back in time to this parents high school reunion it means he always would have gone back in time he already did it theres no way he can affect the future because while its present for him its also earths past and has already occurred
2923902 of course not we only have evidence for time as a singular stream scientifically its pointless to theorize about other assumptions along lines of multiple dimensions
2923903 okay tom heres my stumper how come in books or movies where they travel back in time theyre almost always able to land in the exact same place they left just in a different time
2923904 well think about the location of the earth in our solar system if you were to travel 3 months into the future without changing where you are physically you wouldnt end up on earth youd be floating in space the earth would be a quarter further on its journey around the sun
2923905 youre making the same mistakes we made when determining our place in the cosmos tom the earth isnt flat or the center of the universe nor is it the center of our timeline if you moved through time without moving your physical placement youd miss our atmosphere by quite a bit
2923906 so youd need some way to both travel through space and time is what youre saying
2923907 well i suppose if theres something as improbable as a machine that can move through time it might as well be able to do both
2923908 its not possible we can already move energy from place to place instantly and at some point scientists will figure out a way to move things of substance molecules fragments of bacteria and eventually objects and people
2923909 let me finish scientists will eventually succeed in moving things instantly from place to place but it can never interact with a separate dimension like time
2923910 so what youre telling me is that we can teleport but not while were traveling through time
2923911 what does it matter even if we can figure out how to teleport which i will admit seems at least feasibly possible in current scientific debate we will never be able to travel through time and yet youre hung up on the fact that we can only travel through time not both time and space thats nuts
2923912 why are we even talking about this how did we get on this subject
2923913 heres the deal tom this is the permission form for you to take a guided readings course from me and ordinarily thats what the course would be but im going to change things up a bit
2923914 instead of reading youre going to meet once a week with me to discuss topics of this nature
2923915 youll have to define possibility for me but yes i think youll think of them as possible
2923916 mondays at 3 are best for me and i think that fits into your schedule doesnt it
2923917 yeah thats fine how long will we meet an hour
2923918 yup just one hour a week but i have a feeling that it may feel a little longer than that
2923919 oh absolutely fine my dear yesterday i washed and fed three lepers who suffer from tinea capitis the fungal scalp infection
2923920 web 2 0 is a knowledge oriented environment where human interactions generates content that is published managed and used through network applications in a service oriented architecture
2923921 until the statistical evidence shows that there has been a swing insurance companies will still rate women differently from men
2923922 it feels to me like a real song of the moment here and now in the summer of 2008 its a bit controversial and makes people think
2923923 its always a bit of a shock to hear that you have a no 1 record but i always felt that the blend of the song and the artist was so strong that we stood a good chance of having a hit
2923924 net sales grew by 14 4 y o y to rs 6928 4 crore against rs 6056 8 crore in q1fy08 the sales growth was on the back of 3 65 y o y growth in volumes and strong growth in the realizations of 10 y o y
2923925 we recommend a buy on the stock with a target of rs 634 arrived through the sotp process at the target price the company would be trading at 11x its fy09e eps of rs 57 47 representing an upside potential of 60 from current levels these calculations however do not take into account the recent jlr acquisition which we believe would be strongly eps accretive as we are awaiting the numbers for jlr to be disclosed by tata motors to evaluate it
2923926 tata chemicals is for very patient people and as long as it holds above the rs 290 levels there is a possibility of an up move which could see minor resistance emerging at rs 370 or rs 375 i would recommend a buy ironically only above this threshold once it overcomes with very heavy volumes and the investor commitment shows signs of stepping up so at this point in time if you have it in your portfolio by all means you can hold it but if you are looking at deploying money fresh in the stock you should wait for it to go up before the stock is clearly intending to begin a new up move from here and till then you should wait and watch on the sidelines

2923932 currently sadbhav trades at 16 ttm eps of rs 47 i e almost at par to its industry peers however its order book is just 2 77 its ttm sales of rs 955 5 crore concerns also remain over slower order book growth in last year and rising interest costs as bot projects normally have greater funding requirements we maintain our neutral rating on the stock

2924003 some countries like to use new sanctions but these political efforts and psychological propaganda will eventually be fruitless
2924004 a full fledged adjustment phase has begun for the euro
2924005 he president saakashvili is in big danger of losing the cachet he built up for himself in being pro western and the restraint he has often shown in the face of provocation by russia
2924006 i dont think he can count on the us cavalry riding in
2924007 you dont bring in to nato a country that has this sort of trouble
2924008 it might be a signal to the russians saying that the 2014 sochi olympics will not go the way russia wants if there is no progress on the settlement
2924009 to re establish the authority of russian controlled negotiating and peacekeeping formats to capture georgian controlled villages in south ossetia and to dissuade nato from approving a membership action plan for georgia
2924010 the russians want a more direct confrontation with the west and i hope the bush administration has the wisdom not to give them that satisfaction

2924013 maybe by the end of the year you will see prices at the local market easing when the new stocks get out the warehouses into the local market

2924015 but the market is getting less tight and prices are easing which is good news for importers here
2924016 asia sellers have indicated that they will increase exports soon and it will take a month or two before this takes place
2924017 but im afraid the shortage in the market will reach its peak during ramadan then things will get much better
2924018 masdar is introducing the cdm mechanism to the hydro carbon based fertilizer industry in the gulf region

2924020 since the launch of the first comic book entitled ajaaj we have been busy exploring the various forms of production that will help us raise the profile and values of our superhero we worked very closely with a number of veterans to create a world class intellectual property strongly based on our cultural values and our national identity and at the same time enable it to stand up to competition
2924021 i am very proud to be working with such a groundbreaking theatrical show which involves a state of the art flying system that allows people and props to fly across the stage the show also incorporates computer graphics with live actors creating this illusive effect that will captivate the audiences senses the costumes and props are all made in the uae with a standard that can easily compete with that of hollywood
2924022 more than 900 exhibitors from over 50 countries and 30 national pavilions are set to occupy all 12 halls of the abu dhabi national exhibition centres 55 000 square metre venue at the february show key participants include the united states britain italy france russia turkey and other main defence producers
2924023 we are now talking about 900 companies but the number could increase in the next few months as more firms could confirm their participation this show is the largest in the region and has become one of the biggest defence exhibitions in the world
2924024 such events actually support the image of the uae as a platform for new technologies the thousands of delegates who come to these events also have the chance to see the uae and this will also promote the country as a good and rich tourist idex attracts more than 40 000 visitors who also take time out and go sight seeing in the uae idex serves the organisers adnec abu dhabi and the whole uae
2924025 idex will also incorporate the gulf defence conference which is regarded in international academic and military circles as a top forum on defence strategies and technologies it will also include live demonstrations on land air and sea
2924026 at this point in time we do not have specific information on what our exhibitors are going to be displaying or what products will be launched during idex
2924027 but given our past experience we expect many companies to use idex 2009 as the launch pad for a range of sophisticated weapons also with the events defined focus on technology we expect the latest technologies to be unveiled at the show
2924028 the marina facilities have also been enhanced and we expect a broader range of naval craft will be able to participate in the displays the delegation programme has also been enhanced to ensure that exhibitors and visitors can gain more from their presence at the show
2924029 idex has clearly become one of the largest shows in the world it has grown steadily and occupies a premier position among defence shows it has established credentials and is highly regarded by professionals in the defence industry
2924030 idex is seen worldwide as one of the most important marketing opportunities for the worlds defence industry contracts worth more than us 545 million dh2 billion were closed during the previous edition of idex including us 380 million dh1 4 billion worth of deals signed by the uae armed forces
2924031 the entire mice segment of the industry derives substantial benefits from major shows such as idex all variety of service providers including hotels restaurants benefit greatly from this show all in all the event plays a significant role in building the image of abu dhabi in particular and the uae in general

2924123 the clippers made it very difficult for me to get over here with the medical insurance and them not wanting me to go
2924124 they lied to me a couple times i didnt appreciate it

2924133 and it will be a treasure for the rest of my life
2924134 the one thing they do with all of their athletes is drive them into the ground with training the strongest survive if you dont theyll find another to come and do it
2924135 i mean they dont do little things like block out good airline seats for them when they travel they can all be in middle seats in coach for all they care and thats how yao travels with them whatever happens with his injuries theyre going to insist that he keeps playing for them
2924136 it felt like a storybook when he hit that shot

2924150 there exist valid grounds to cite jake macasaet for indirect contempt
2924151 macasaet has absolutely no basis to call the supreme court a court of thieves and a basket of rotten apples
2924152 there are a few which are rotten t hat makes the whole basket rotten
2924153 protect ing immediate litigants and the public from the mischievous danger of an unfree or coerced tribunal

2924209 this particular air force exercise is important because india is included among some very important allies
2924210 this is definitely an extension of an arc that has been mapped out since 2000 and it really signifies that what india and the united states have is a strategic relationship
2924211 pyongyang through its state run news agency the korean central news agency has consistently and passionately criticized such ventures accusing the united states of harboring hostile intentions toward north korea
2924212 beijing would likely remain reticent about such training since it does not see itself as directly and imminently affected by such activities
2924213 we will learn how our allies operate in response to similar threats
2924214 it will allow us to build observations to eventually learn those lessons about what it takes to integrate talk fly with employ deploy and sustain air power with places like india korea and france
2924215 not only are we cutting down quite a bit on the amount of paint and materials needed for these types of repairs but often when i look at them i cant even tell where the dent was
2924216 in general the auto body repair industry is way behind the times
2924217 companies are doing things the way they have been done for many years and its not really an industry that has focused on environmental responsibility
2924218 we feel like we are the educators and people are happy when they find us because they feel like they are making the right choice for the environment
2924219 bumperdoc is reducing the amount of materials needed and often eliminating typical auto repair waste altogether

2924226 the credit reporting industry has been seeking since to my knowledge the early 1970s to move towards whats sometimes called positive reporting and sometimes called comprehensive reporting and theyre both gloss words which essentially mean significantly more intrusive reporting and data holding about individuals
2924227 we needed to have a process that involved consultations with all relevant parties at the table in order to thrash out the details

2924241 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2924242 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2924243 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2924244 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2924245 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2924246 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2924247 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2924251 distracted the erosion of attention and the coming dark age
2924252 yet were connecting in thinner more faceless ways we experience fewer visits fewer telephone calls fewer contacts all around except e mail were subsisting on this diet of snippets and glimpses of each other socially
2924253 if were having feelings with someone else that we need to confront
2924254 many times well resort to an e mail rather than take the risk of picking up the phone and calling its a very egocentric act its dumping and it gets really misunderstood

2924259 report compare is an invaluable asset for our test team
2924260 a typical regression test on our applications would produce hundreds of reports it just wasnt feasible to manually check through all of these subsequently when an error was picked up it took huge amounts of research time to run through the reports trying to figure out why it was wrong the worst case scenario though would be the financial implications of something we didnt catch going out the door it really was an unacceptable level of risk that we were at pains to minimize nothing on the market sufficiently met our needs report compare will reduce corporate risk and allow us to improve the quality of our applications

2924262 banyak kedai makan dan restoran terpaksa ditutup kerana selalu sangat berlaku gangguan bekalan air ini membuatkan kedai banyak yang kosong tak boleh berniaga sebab bagi kedai makan air merupakan keperluan utama
2924263 bila masa ada air yang kecil dan terputus putus itu pula kami terpaksa tadah 24 jam tapi biasanya tak cukup juga jadi terpaksalah punggah air dari tempat lain kerana masalah air ini juga kebanyakan peniaga tidak tinggal di sini tetapi terpaksa berulang dari tempat lain
2924264 disebabkan kes air yang kritikal ini ada yang mengambil kesempatan menggunakan lori ambil air dari sungai pahang dan menjualnya secara tong bagi kami peniaga kedai makan ini tidak ada pilihan lain terpaksa beli juga kerana kedai makan inilah sumber pendapatan kami
2924265 sebab itu saya minta jba dan wakil rakyat serius sikitlah ambil perhatian masalah asasi peniaga di sini kami minta atasi segera masalah meruncing ini kalau tidak kami boleh gulung tikar
2924266 saya dengar pulak cerita tidak lama lagi satu projek bandar baru melibatkan pusat perniagaan akan dibina di pekan awah ini tidak lama lagi kalau sekarang ini masalah utama ini tidak diselesaikan bagaimana pula bila bangunan kedai bertambah nanti
2924267 saya sendiri telah membeli kedai ini daripada pasdec holding sejak 1990 tapi bila semak balik nilai harga bangunan ini tidak meningkat seperti kawasan lain sekarang ini kebanyakan kedai juga kosong bukan tidak ada yang nak sewa tapi tak jadi atau keluar semula kerana masalah bekalan air ini
2924268 kami juga kesal dengan sikap adun yang nampak kurang mengambil perhatian walau pun aduan telah dibuat tidak terhitung banyaknya

2924270 masalah gangguan bekalan air menyebabkan aktiviti harian keluarga dan masyarakat termasuk pengurusan jenazah kerap kali terganggu kami faham mungkin air tidak mencukupi kerana pertambahan jumlah penduduk tetapi kenapa tidak dipertingkatkan kerana bekalan air itu berbayar bukannya percuma
2924271 kami membayar bil air setiap bulan tetapi perkhidmatan yang diterima penduduk amat mengecewakan

2924285 cpi inflation is expected to be higher in the short term at around five per cent in the december quarter reflecting the effects of higher petrol prices and the recent correction to estimates of financial services inflation before declining thereafter
2924286 nevertheless prices remain around 60 per cent above the average level in 2007 reflecting a combination of strong demand from developing countries a muted supply response and the depreciation of the us dollar
2924287 it is expected that the annual rate of cpi inflation will rise further in the september quarter in part due to the effect of higher petrol prices over the year
2924288 this extended period of high inflation is a reflection of the extent of price pressures evident in recent quarters
2924289 the june quarter data suggest that aggregate inflation may be levelling out but is yet to show an sign of easing
2924290 demand pressures in the economy now appear to be easing and the forecasts project a significant period of slower growth which will result in a moderation of capacity pressures
2924291 but even allowing for that both the cpi and underlying measures suggest that inflation has remained high
2924292 if the recent easing in demand is not as long lasting as the forecasts envisage or if the stimulus to domestic activity to the terms of trade causes demand to be stronger than expected the easing in inflation could be more modest than forecast

2924332 im more concerned about the exploitation of young women than where this type of activity was taking place
2924333 we are opposed to the abuse of young women in the sex trade and this is not the type of activity we want to see in hotels
2924334 it is a matter for the hotel about what goes on behind its doors but more and more women are being exploited and something has to be done about it
2924335 we have additional security procedures in place to try to prevent this type of activity and restrict non guests gaining access
2924336 our staff are extremely vigilant and this problem is very rare but should we suspect activity of this nature would ask a guest to leave
2924337 the police are on to people like me and my friends and we are worried about them
2924338 but they wont stop the business or keep us away from belfast because business is just so good in this town
2924339 there are dangerous people out there but we stay in the hotel because they are usually safe

2924351 you are coming with us to tskhinvali you are not going back i promise you
2924352 why do this why do this to us we are just ordinary people we havent harmed anyone
2924353 you can see nobody wanted to help us the un and the americans they all sat there while we got bombed it was the russians who saved us one more day and this whole place would no longer exist and nor would any of us
2924354 that is human flesh the georgians had not given us time to bury our dead when they attacked
2924355 there are volunteers here from all over the caucasus and russia
2924356 stop asking your questions i havent slept for six days
2924357 look at that the georgians fired the ammunition but it was provided by the british and the americans

2924361 a man who issued orders to commit war crimes which resulted in thousands of deaths of peaceful civilians cannot be viewed by russia as a partner
2924362 we have started operations because we saw the georgian attack on south ossetia and knew abkhazia would be next
2924363 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2924364 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2924365 its no longer possible to listen to georgia talk about a peaceful solution in south ossetia or abkhazia or offer us autonomy georgia has shown its real face

2924371 this particular air force exercise is important because india is included among some very important allies
2924372 this is definitely an extension of an arc that has been mapped out since 2000 and it really signifies that what india and the united states have is a strategic relationship
2924373 pyongyang through its state run news agency the korean central news agency has consistently and passionately criticized such ventures accusing the united states of harboring hostile intentions toward north korea
2924374 beijing would likely remain reticent about such training since it does not see itself as directly and imminently affected by such activities
2924375 we will learn how our allies operate in response to similar threats
2924376 it will allow us to build observations to eventually learn those lessons about what it takes to integrate talk fly with employ deploy and sustain air power with places like india korea and france
2924377 we think whoever stole it might come back and try and take the male or well get a ransom demand for the female
2924378 we believe this may have been a targeted burglary of a shark that is extremely rare in the uk
2924379 the victim is desperate for the fish to be returned and we urge anyone with information about the burglary to contact us
2924380 due to the unusual type of shark it will be difficult to sell in this country
2924381 ive been involved in conservation issues in the philippines and indonesia where a lot of fisherman use cyanide to kill sharks
2924382 the big problem is not on the beach its whats happening in the seas
2924383 these jellyfish near shore are a message the sea is sending us saying look how badly you are treating me

2924386 at the time i was shaken up a bit but now im just trying to think clearly
2924387 were out of toilet paper and there are about 70 people lined up to use the bathroom
2924388 theres an empty place next to me wherever i go
2924389 i died on nov 15 2007 when you killed my husband charles george stoecker
2924390 i get asked all the time have you heard from him no i havent heard from him and i dont expect to hear from him
2924391 we continue to work closely with marc and we havent encountered any major impediments
2924392 the major issue we confront is honestly one of capacity and how do you provide additional service without degrading the service you already have
2924393 thats when they do a lot of the maintenance of their tracks
2924394 theyve been trying to work with us but theyve also been saying here are our issues
2924395 we have tried to get someone in there independently to see if theres anything we can suggest
2924396 its going to help with reliability and its also going to help with capacity
2924397 were trying to speed up some other things were trying to get coaches sooner
2924398 this is one tool to help them have access to justice
2924399 the way the immigration system is set up its very difficult for people to get their day in court and to have access to due process
2924400 they dont automatically have an attorney and so for many of them its very difficult
2924401 in order to attend to every raid which is our goal were going to need to have a lot of contributions
2924402 weve also received over 175 000 in requests for bond releases across the country
2924403 we need to raise 300 000 to 500 000 a month just to begin to meet the demand this effort needs a crisis response
2924404 we certainly dont have any problem with private efforts to make sure that illegal immigrants have fair hearings
2924405 but we think that the money would be spent more in the national interest if it were used to assist illegal immigrants involuntarily returning to their homelands
2924406 i would like to see the people responsible for this arrested
2924407 my daughter was a victim just like my grandson she didnt willingly decide im going to kill my son its not like that somebody made that decision to not feed that child and my daughter had to follow instructions
2924408 it had one of the largest draws in the country

2924428 we knew it was going to be quick world swimming has really shot up in the last nine months our time would have won world championships last year
2924429 i woke up at 5 30am and went for a walk and had a big breakfast for the first time in my life i ate rice for breakfast

2924433 ok then i want you to do some deep breathing but be careful only hyperventilate slightly because if you faint underwater it would be tragic when i raise my hand we will both take our final breaths then i will dive into the water and you will follow me to the akwangtqua and into the tzvaleubhoi
2924434 well i mean you should be able to hold you breath in a natural way umm ok lets do a practice run do some deep breathing and hold
2924435 i felt dizzy i thought i was going to faint
2924436 thats not good you over did it next time a little less youre going to have to depend on your natural lung capacity ok youll just do a few preparatory breaths and then one deep breath ok start and ill give you the signal when to dive
2924437 this is the tzvaleubhoi the cave of the third sun
2924438 in a sense it is but much cooler it is much much cooler than the sun it would have to be 93 million miles away if it were as hot as the sun but this sun is very close to us
2924439 i feel like im floating on the ocean and a wave just passed under me i must be getting sick or something
2924440 naztko how are you i want you to meet doug
2924441 no need to get up just rest nice to meet you doug and now you see why we cant swim out of here im afraid ive become too fat and lazy to swim out of the tunnels
2924442 yes weve been feeling quite a few tremors and something is very odd
2924443 the far outer wall is very hot we think someone has activated the pfayohiqusi of the third kind without permission
2924444 give me all the reports you have and ill look into it you see like ive been telling you actually doug got me started on this heres an example of where modern technology can help us analyze a situation the traditional ways are not always sufficient
2924445 ive been worried enough to think you might have a point something doesnt feel right to me ive a very bad feeling about zusoiti i dont know how to explain this insight but i think the way i could put it is that somehow zusoiti is creating what perhaps i should call an interface between pfayohiqusi and modern technologies i dont know how to describe my vision because im not familiar with modern technology do you know what this might be
2924446 well if she could build a modern device that would simulate the steps that a person would apply to operate the pfayohiqusi and then connected that modern device to the internet she could have a remote station anywhere does this make sense to you
2924447 well anyway thats just speculation in the meantime were going to need your vote
2924448 this scuba gear that you want to order will let us swim out
2924449 let me read about it im not sure if i like this up top technology
2924450 i dont know if the tunnels become blocked there will be a dilemma
2924451 what dilemma if the entrance tunnel collapses youll just stay here forever whats the problem were self sufficient
2924452 a tyrant may seize absolute power and even you will not be safe from her reach
2924453 that does it i must go to the forbidden zone immediately
2924454 i must reactivate the dormant pfayohiqusi that serve the tzvaleubhoi exclusively
2924455 no you must not you cannot enter the forbidden zone until the gods return
2924456 i must it is pcapdyntpa as a member of the grand council i hereby declare an emergency
2924457 do you swear by the sacred oath by the gydm that this in holy purpose is pcapdyntpa
2924458 doug im sorry we have to meet under such strange circumstances but ive heard some good things about you how is zawmbyee
2924459 i cant get over how it seems like i am outside is this a complete ecosystem
2924460 its an ecology of convenience a necessary delusion i suppose its an unnatural environment because we have no predators
2924461 predators kill the weak and keep the gene pool strong
2924462 eat this for your trip back a sample of paradise
2924463 come closer catch your breath we cant hear the news if the messenger dies whatever the crisis we can spare a few minutes
2924464 i imagine reactivating such ancient pfayohiqusi would bring some enigmas well deal with it
2924465 i got to use this bottle you gave me last year how is it
2924466 yes yes yes do i have to be so official ok its pcapdyntpa i swear
2924467 as best as i can figure out it has something to do with earth wobble eccentricity and the blockage of equatorial ocean currents but you have to see it for yourself its better if you get the complete picture i dont think i can describe it properly here
2924468 yes i think shes tapping into the grzepepa looking for information
2924469 youre right we had better call a meeting wed better go now
2924470 doug listen carefully do you know hexadecimal to binary conversion
2924471 ok now i want you to change each one to an r and each zero to an l so now say nine is r l l r
2924472 two is l l r l but what is this for
2924473 r means take a right turn in the tunnel l means turn left these are the directions you will need to leave through the tunnel maze naztko and i have to go to the forbidden zone and you have to go back to the nipeiskwari by yourself youre going to have to hold your breath and swim out if you get lost in the tunnel you wont have enough breath to get back home
2924474 nine go right left left right two go left left right left just remember 92 ok
2924475 utcoozhoo is in the forbidden zone and reactivated its pfayohiqusi he used the grpnl to send me a message in the sacred quarters he said the tunnel collapsed and i didnt think you were going to make it
2924476 a lot of up top people have returned to the cave to help during this crisis
2924477 how are you i heard you were the last person to make it out of the tunnel and how is naztko
2924478 im ok i last saw him running to the forbidden zone with utcoozhoo
2924479 yes he seemed rejuvenated by the emergency but i really didnt get a chance to talk to him much
2924480 yes well he is a fine gentleman and very wise i think he and utcoozhoo will find out whats happening ive got to go zawmbyee tell doug everything be well and dont worry well find zusoiti
2924481 she left the cave for the up top world no one seems to know where she went but she seems to have established herself and set up a remote access station shes tapped into the grzepepa the gods data base looking for the protocols to launch the gstfibiches
2924482 the arrows that reach the stars she wants to call back the gods we think there may be a whole constellation of procedures and sequences that if wrongly applied by the pfayohoqwaahujpi might trigger an ice age which is what she wants
2924483 so youre telling me zusoiti is using her new found wealth to destroy us and trap utcoozhoo are the tremors i felt the beginning
2924484 we dont know yet about that but there are indications of changes in the ocean currents and were concerned about earth wobble
2924485 the ancient prophesy is true that the world will end in a frozen agony of death and suffering ive accomplished nothing and now the world ends isnt this charming
2924486 doug dont be so down let me tell you the story of tpiqlatng that utcoozhoo always tells me
2924487 well im sure its a charming story but isnt tpiqlatng an ancient hero if hes a prototypical hero from mythology he would have greater courage and insight than any of us mere mortals could ever hope to have
2924488 i suppose that would be if he were a myth but hes not except to the extent that primitive people had trouble describing miraculous things they didnt understand so the description is a little ambiguous but anyway i just want to tell you an inspirational story pretend its a bedtime story and anyway youre a contradiction you know because you choose to believe the worst youre willing to believe the ancient prophesy of doom right so you want to believe the worst and i want to believe the best
2924489 well some of these ancient tales are very unlikely to have happened
2924490 yes thats what tpiqlatng said to the god kragzluk what
2924491 oh never mind im tired enough for a bedtime story what did tpiqlatng say
2924492 kragzluk told him he would bring all the deer to an inner garden tpiqlatng thought that was highly unlikely kragzluk told him he would create a sun to place in the cave tpiqlatng broke into laughter saying thats as improbable as all the deer coming to be slaughtered
2924493 kragzluk replied intelligence applied can focus harmony into a certainty detail comes from focus
2924494 otuux thinks it means deuterium or hydrogen you know what makes the sun shine
2924495 yes well but he did memorize the words even though he didnt understand it
2924496 yes but even if everything were perfect all the time all of us will eventually die
2924497 im just following your logic playing devils advocate is this world the only existence didnt you hint at this question in you poetry
2924498 i guess but thats just crappy poetry it doesnt really mean anything does it
2924499 and oh would you autograph this damn thing already for me i think im a friend of the author you know
2924500 yeah ok but no one is ever going to see it
2924501 well i dont know about that but you know what utcoozhoo always says
2924502 when a grasshopper has made a book from the leaves of a fallen tree and no one has heard the tree fall is the grasshopper literate even if no one hears it sing
2924503 yes i have sweet lips ok ill indulge your dark mood with one of your crappy poems so lets see here is dark sun
2924504 and as utcoozhoo always says zawmbyee is so beautiful so exquisite
2924505 ok now how can we help i have no idea whats going on
2924506 utcoozhoo wants us to leave the cave again mingle around in the up top milieu perhaps by the blue attic club but see if we can sniff out a trail that leads to zusoiti
2924507 well im not exactly an expert on high society you know
2924508 that may be but she is quite clever charismatic and i wouldnt be surprised if shes found some supporters and sycophants to help her out even if shes new to the up top world ill bet they find her oddness attractive and her obscure philosophies profound by default when they are intrigued but puzzled and of course she is a champion at bluffing that she has an army behind her before she has assembled it
2924509 utcoozhoo says to just go with the flow see what you see
2924510 geez im glad utcoozhoo has such confidence in us to be cool hang out i think i could do that
2924511 yes lets celebrate vagueness and i have venison and buffalo fried in duck fat with truffles just like you like it and a little caponata blue cheese wine and me
2924512 yes i feel better already and we dont need to know what utcoozhoo really means
2924513 enraptured in the blankets of home with you of you
2924514 we are the morning together together an awakening is here to be for real at home peaceful passion satisfaction day not dreaming but being in the lightness of us with us we are warm being the morning sun better than a dream
2924515 and you kept to the original without one of those arrangements that ruins a song
2924516 sometimes im in the mood and for a minute i improvise a song but then somehow i drift off key its frustrating i feel like i should be a singer but my voice has run away from a roar to a snarl when it should be humming
2924517 by the roar of your hum i think you could learn to focus your sorrow your joy if youd let the inner music carry you beyond a thought
2924518 thats a thought um i mean maybe i could where are we going today
2924519 why dont we go to the village near the cave exit for breakfast today its quiet and peaceful and the caf has good service ive heard
2924520 ok join me in the shower and ill get you singing in a clean clear voice
2924521 off to the suds then mlady zawmbee warmbee is okey dokey soapy shall we dance to the shower
2924522 well youve always been an official visitor to the sacred quarters you know like an ambassador to the white house honored but not trusted but now you can sneak in and out as the honorable lover with tacit approval if not by the gods then by me
2924523 these are great i remember seeing them when you were still angry at the paint for not being the perfect color but youve made every shadow complement the bursting out joy magnificent colors dont you think someone should see these
2924524 maybe maybe we could do that joint project you wanted to do

2924583 non c da preoccuparsi perch evidente che il problema sta incidendo in maniera netta sulle partite che i ragazzi stanno giocando e utile che noi disputiamo test conm avversari di un certo livello perch come detto da mister marino servono ad evidenziare certi difetti le assenze sono un dato di fatto nessuna squadra pu permettersi di regalare motta zapata coda e felipe si venuto a creare un insieme di situazioni che non facilitano lallenatore anche lanno scorso poi si diceva che erano troppo i cinque gol presi col napoli alla seconda giornata poi sappiamo che campionato abbiamo disputato in precampionato lanno passato pagammo dazio sul piano fisico come oggi diciamo che siamo stati premiati da alcuni episodi col paserraikos abbiamo avuto due occasioni per fare il 2 2 e se avesimo segnato poi amgari avremmo anche vinto i greci poi non fa nemmeno lavoro di palestra e distanze lunghe vogliono partire foprte in campionato se non fanno drammi roma e milan quindinon vedo perch metterci noi a farli siamo consapevoli dei nostri pregi e dei nostri difetti il fatto che dobbiamo crescere nella mentalit lanno scorso quando eravamo in condizione non avevamo paura di nulla e qui che dobbiamo migliorare per diventare una grande squadra e normale che marino in questi giorni sia scuro in volto ma mi adopero in pubblico proprio per dare tranquillit a questi ragazzi sono certo che cfare queste brutte figure ci servito e che alla prima faremo una grande partita col palermo

2924588 an ideological shift of that magnitude is far from unprecedented
2924589 i was advised by several lawyers not to go into details of the mifare classic but anybody who has access to google
2924590 i was horrified to learn that he hadnt been contacted about the change in arrangements
2924591 ive apologised and weve had a good discussion about that its a very unfortunate set of circumstances

2924599 i have a picture of kobe bryant in my olympic room
2924600 i thought im good im going to make it to the final so i slowed my tempo down a little bit
2924601 i wasnt expecting it i didnt go in planning to break the world record i swim really well when im feeling happy and my life is balanced also with my parents and boyfriend in the crowd
2924602 the 100 back has been the biggest progressing event in my opinion i expected that
2924603 its exactly where i wanted to be going into the finals im happy with that i just need to recover and focus on my final
2924604 ive tried every antidepressant and canada decongestants ephedrine none of them works for me
2924605 everybody knows i havent raced since nationals but i think its been good for me
2924606 i was waiting for the pain to go away so i had a little bit of doubt
2924607 today i just did one set which is all i wanted to do normally i would do two sets i could have run faster after i warmed up on the first set so im very confident im where i was at in the nationals
2924608 someone told me this is one of the most anticipated 100 meter dashes in history thats going to bring a lot of excitement to the sport
2924609 we played them two years ago and we won something like 21 to 2 or 3 theyve come a long way since then
2924610 the chinese people are so proud and they are so welcoming
2924611 to them it is competition but it is friendly competition that is what they want more than anything
2924612 i feel pretty good were part of a croatian olympic family and we all feel pretty good
2924613 four years ago we werent getting no cheers from nobody
2924614 this year we had chinese fans with us we had u s fans with us and im pretty sure we had a couple of other little countries out there too
2924615 we fought our hardest we tried to make it a good game i think we lost to a strong team
2924616 its good to get out here and get a game under your belt
2924617 we didnt play our a plus game today we played pretty good but we have a lot of room to improve
2924618 i tend to not really get nervous when im out on a tennis court but today was a little different
2924619 when it comes to sport we will always remain friends if the world were to draw any lessons from what we do there wouldnt be any wars there should be no hatred between athletes and people in general well leave it to the politicians to figure it out
2924620 reflects the olympic spirit and the value of the games
2924621 our athletes are nervous they are thinking about their families
2924622 but we are together with more passion and feeling maybe athletes can show somehow that you should be fighting only the sports arena we can show all of the world that we want peace
2924623 early in the season our pitching kept us in games and we found ways to win but right now were not playing well and were not swinging the bats great we have maybe one key at bat per game one at bat to do something and we havent capitalized on it
2924624 its great we got off to a good start and played that well but unfortunately it created some unrealistic expectations outside the organization
2924625 that said theres no reason we cant bounce back the next seven weeks and play the way we did in the first half
2924626 truthfully the results are nasty but i feel like i made some very good improvements today with my stuff
2924627 im going to keep fighting obviously i have to start getting outs and putting up zeros you can talk all day about feeling better
2924628 i know ive been in the league 23 months and the first 22 were pretty solid the last month was the first time ive experienced prolonged poor results and it will turn around im probably not going to see late innings when weve got a guy whos thrown 37 scoreless innings i understand that at the same time i expect that within a month from now sept 10 i will have righted my ship
2924629 more than anything its coincidence we played really really well the early part of the season and we expected to be a lot better than this
2924630 obviously the biggest thing is the offense we havent swung the bats well its been really bad its not fun at all
2924631 i think the volatility of young players combined with some of the injuries weve had created the perfect storm to have a bad stretch unfortunately
2924632 we didnt expect to lose 10 games in a row but we expected some tough times
2924633 so i turned to raj and said this is a state meet
2924634 we know what a kid of 14 or 15 or 16 looks like what kind of slap in the face is this they are 12 14 years old and they get lined up and the government backs them and the federation runs away there is an age limit and it cant be controlled
2924635 why do three quarters of all likely voters and nearly 60 of democrats even support off shore oil drilling is it because its gotten safer or cleaner no is it because weve decided that what with all those dangerous rays of sunlight we are less enamored of our beaches and coastline no is it because oil rigs are better looking than they used to be or because were feeling sorry for the domestic oil companies who arent making enough money need more sources of profit closer to home no and no and no there is only one reason for the shift in popular support for domestic drilling for an issue that used to be a political loser now smelling like a bouquet of roses the reason is the price of gas plain and simple
2924636 era un popor brav acela care a impus tribut romei era un popor nobil acela a carui cadere te umple de lacrimi iar nu de dispret si a fi descendentul unui popor de eroi plin de noblete de amor de patrie si libertate a fi descendentul unui asemenea popor na fost si nu va fi rusine niciodata

2924649 i told martha we never do things the easy way
2924650 we like to fight and the most important day will be in two days
2924651 our team doctor said we were like a bunch of racehorses we were so ready to get out there we wanted to compete and i think everybody might have had some extra nerves
2924652 we had kind of a sigh of relief like we didnt die its all good
2924653 its easier to deal with mistakes when youre in a better mood and you know how you can fix things
2924654 can a person be a good businessman but a lousy economist yes take t boone pickens for example hes all over television touting his plan for wind power as a substitute for foreign oil a plan that calls for massive government subsidies this should immediately make us suspicious if wind is so good why does it need subsidies

2924656 now that john mccain has ever so slyly maneuvered paris hilton into the presidential race to drain feminist votes from barack obama we can only hope her stunning announcement video delivered pool side in a stylin leopard print swimsuit will elevate the debate it certainly cannot get much sillier who knew when the mccain campaign made that commercial featuring barack obama paris hilton and britney spears obama would turn out to be the more vacuous celebrity
2924657 i knew when i retired i would still be busy
2924658 we are truly relying on gods providence to supply vocations
2924659 our top priority is to work toward generating a culture where vocations to religious life and priesthood become a common and active consideration in the lives of young people as they grow and discern the particular way god is calling them
2924660 any diocese has to consider this one of the greatest problems it has
2924661 they cant continue to exist the way they have for centuries the problem compounds itself because the more aging priests there are the more of an unattractive option it becomes for young people who see a 65 year old man who might be running around supervising three different parishes
2924662 we have no idea how many of our senior priests will be active in the next five to 10 years
2924663 one of the most difficult decisions is telling a priest when its time to retire because its not just a job its your whole life
2924664 one work with the superintendent and the board to keep people working in their jobs broward school district is the largest employer in this county and people working helps boost the economy two explore ways to help more students graduate improve the graduation rate in respect to the needs of the business community three expand insurance coverage to be fair four overhaul bidding process we need more qualified vendors in order to give a fair share to more companies
2924665 i believe with the energy crisis students should attend the school closest to their homes unless they attend a school near the workplace this allows students to feel a part of the neighborhood and participate in school activities at this time enrollment is decreasing for the first time in many years and i believe rather than building new schools we need to renovate the older ones until our enrollment starts to increase
2924666 thirty years experience working for the school board in various capacities proven ability to work with diverse groups to achieve common goals i have direct experience working with various departments of the school board i am a known entity i know the facilities department they know me i have been on every campus in broward county and know the warts and scars of all the buildings
2924667 fiscal responsibility whatever adjustments are made with the budget cutbacks teacher salary curriculum costs and student educational needs should be the first things the school board should be willing to expend the extra dollars on the students are the priority and they should have the best teachers to instruct them on the business side of education the brite software will help the districts business manager find the leaks in this very large ship without a clear tally on what the district is spending we will never know what changes can be made other priorities include boosting student retention and stabilizing overcrowded schools
2924668 in the unpredictable economy and the many foreclosures in the housing market it would behoove the school system to create a school lottery as many large school districts in the nation now use this will steer students to underenrolled schools in fair proportions and may be an alternative to boundary changes for overpopulated schools
2924669 for the past 22 years i have been an administrator for the broward county school system having the opportunity to work in many communities throughout the county i have been in collaboration with the school board of broward county safety department school facility department on building and renovating schools these experiences have given me an all inclusive perspective to add to the broward school board i also have decades of community involvement as a resident of the city of hollywood
2924670 one prioritizing the capital needs of the schools and efficiently targeting construction money to refurbish older schools two finding money to retain top teachers for the broward school system to succeed we need to make sure that our teachers remain in broward this is most effectively done by fairly compensating them three restoring parents confidence in our public schools especially east side schools the school board needs to take the lead in marketing our public schools highlighting our strengths to these parents
2924671 though unpopular boundary shifts are unavoidable as people move and the county has less undeveloped land on which to build new schools in an ideal world boundary decisions would keep neighborhood integrity so that schools remain close to the communities which they serve yet our kids are not well served when they are placed in severely overcrowded classrooms given our current economic constraints and reality of overcrowding we have to take this into account in current boundary discussions
2924672 i believe the school system will benefit from someone with an engineering background who can focus on the business side of the school system my interest in education started early as the son of two teachers i want to take my construction and business experience along with my love for education to the school board
2924673 business and consumer confidence is at its lowest level now since the recession in 1991
2924674 this is just one of hundreds of thousands of businesses in australia that represent collectively the energy and the enterprise that is the foundation of our economic prosperity in australia
2924675 one of the reasons we stay very closely in touch with small business is not just because so many people from our side of politics come from a small business background but because small business is the largest employer in australia
2924676 crucial to the coalition reconnecting with small business making sure that our policies reflect their needs
2924677 by and large if youre a politician and youre not out there then you need to some serious brushing up
2924678 to speak directly to their elected representatives about how things are in the business community
2924679 we left this morning and four women were going to the doctor and one was going shopping in al wajihiyah
2924680 the global oil price may be sliding but the weakness in the aussie is capping any falls in petrol pump prices
2924681 the australian dollar has fallen by almost 10 cents since its highs to around 89 us cents wiping out 10 cents of potential gains at the pump
2924682 there is no doubt that oil companies are cutting fuel prices however the lag period for the fall in prices needs to be questioned
2924683 the national average price should be much closer to 1 40 a litre by now rather than the 1 50
2924684 last time the surface wasnt up to the standard that wed hoped but were satisfied now and have no issue with it
2924685 im saying theyre talking to me im not talking to them im not ringing them up and i dont talk to them for very long
2924686 thats the reality of football i know for certain some of the players whove left our club in the past have spoken long and hard with coaches at other club
2924687 but i guarantee were not lying down and were in the game and well be in the game whether its recruiting for trading or uncontracted players well be in the game
2924688 thats up in the air whether thomson plays again we certainly have a view of where adam is and similar to nathan lonie and greg bentley last week toby thurstans we know what they can provide for the club and well continue to look at the others and if we need well pick them as well
2924689 we know where theyre at we need to consider how the others are and then make some choices
2924690 players argue when we win too and its only really highlighted when you lose
2924691 i suppose the tradition of the club here is you demand a lot from each other and i know over the years we won premiership after premiership wed argue with each other and demand a lot from each other and try to keep the standard up so im sure thats a lot of it and i suppose carlton arent used to that
2924692 if you look at the second half of the game we didnt stop trying when you lose its easy to kick a dog when its down and thats probably what andrews doing
2924693 ever perceived by the rest of the nation as perched on the fringe of rationality san francisco is about to flip its lid once again the lids color if its any comfort is green as in one of the three recycling bins into which its residents will be forced to sort their food waste the consequences for the unwilling if the mayor has his way fines up to 1 000 from the garbage police i kid you not mayor gavin newsom is taking the leap from voluntary environmental engagement to an enforced one you will recycle or youll be outed says the legislation drafted by the citys department of the environment other cities have mandatory recycling san francisco is upping the ante creating the first composting law directing where youll dish your table scraps
2924694 its frustrating theres a huge paper trail but then you dont get anywhere
2924695 so many people have emergencies but whats the worst emergency theres money but theres not enough of it
2924696 this is not a good way to run a railroad
2924697 our needs right now are covered but i know the time is coming when he is going to need help
2924698 we tend to be treading water the system has never been able to support everybody who is in need
2924699 i would like to congratulate paul henderson and concede that i am the opposition leader
2924700 it appears the way the numbers have fallen means that the country liberals have done exceptional work but fallen short
2924701 i would like to congratulate paul henderson and concede that i am the opposition leader
2924702 it appears the way the numbers have fallen means that the country liberals have done exceptional work but fallen short
2924703 the minister informed me of the request by a small number of papuans who had been granted protection visas in australia of their desire to explore the possibility of returning to papua
2924704 this of course is a matter for the papuans concerned and a matter between them and indonesia
2924705 there was a time in the relationship between australia and indonesia when such a discussion would have potentially caused great difficulties
2924706 because australia and indonesia are neighbours and partners and friends like family like neighbours there may from time to time be issues where you have difficulties or a small disagreement
2924707 we deal with these things in a business like manner we take it in our stride
2924708 which in the case of papua for example and generally respects indonesias territorial sovereignty over indonesia
2924709 i explained that this is the part of the latest trend that many papuans who have been living overseas want to return to papua
2924710 there were about 700 of them some living in papua new guinea
2924711 so this must be the reflection of good conditions in papua in terms of security and economic development
2924712 when it comes to terrorists who have been convicted and are subject to the death penalty australia does not as a policy make representations on their behalf
2924713 we understand the concerns expressed on the situations of their nationals
2924714 to be a force to be reckoned with means a lot this year has just been phenomenal its just crazy
2924715 i cant believe we dont win a race in three or four weeks and were in a slump
2924716 i got a good piece of wood on that one
2924717 we had a couple of ducks on the pond and thats when i step it up
2924718 every now and then you get lucky and get a base hit
2924719 i just need to keep believing in myself im pretty happy with the way this week worked out
2924720 i guess i should have told my caddie to take the pin out
2924721 polanco got one in the wind and carlos came two or three steps in and then had to sprint to the track
2924722 it was a swirling wind i was glad its 420 feet out there carlos has good makeup speed
2924723 it was not simple because the wind was kind of wild at first i thought it was in front of me but if i hurried and got too tight i might drop the ball so i tried to stay loose i knew id get there easy
2924724 you put the ball on the ground you have to run
2924725 its more of a team unity thing nick and i ran it i told eric day one that unless i pass out i am going to try to do everything that everyone else does
2924726 coach z pretty much called out the plays that were going to be the plays that stand out in the game
2924727 thats two weeks in a row when you get that belief and that excitement its good to see
2924728 i love the idea of the back nine on sunday at a major
2924729 i love it so much that im kind of disappointed theres eight months until the next one i need the adrenaline
2924730 i feel like ive played well enough to win more than two majors throughout my career to this point
2924731 unfortunately it hasnt happened that doesnt mean im not on the right track its just a matter of time
2924732 paddy is just so mentally tough and hes a great putter
2924733 when he gets an opportunity he always takes advantage of it
2924734 hes won three of the last six majors thats tiger like right there he knows how to win and hes not afraid to win and thats what it takes

2924738 the launch of our mobile offering demonstrates tmgs continued commitment to becoming a truly multi media multi platform news service
2924739 building on the success of the recent redesign of telegraph co uk this latest development reflects tmgs dedication to bringing up to the minute content to the consumer whenever and wherever they demand it
2924740 by rebranding to zain we are bringing together our african and middle east operations under a single strong and unique identity
2924741 we believe the zain brand provides an optimal platform upon which we can build a top 100 global brand with the ultimate goal of better serving our customers it builds upon the success of our african operations and will propel the zain group towards becoming one of the top 10 global mobile telecommunications companies by 2011
2924742 as with any communications network providing an open channel between content companies and consumers there is potential for misuse we believe the mobile content industry can only fulfill its true potential when consumers have complete confidence in the quality and value for money of services they consume on their mobile working in complete alignment with regulation is the only way for the industry to achieve this
2924743 we believe this technology will raise the bar for audio quality on multimedia phones and expect dolby mobile to help us create a new trend in the mobile phone industry
2924744 lg is committed to providing our customers with the best features available and our new collaboration with dolby helps us deliver on this pledge
2924745 just like with a pc people want to be able to do more with the mobile internet than just surf
2924746 this has been proven with the phenomenal early success of the apple iphone app store which has launched with over 500 applications offering anything from games to music ebooks social networking and location based services the point is this phenomenon could have occurred much sooner but operators have operated and to a large extent still are operating with mobile garden walls where operators make it difficult for customers to access content and applications outside of their own proprietary portals
2924747 mobile operators have to abandon the walled garden approach if they are to exploit the potential of the mobile internet
2924748 the early days of the fixed line internet were characterised by telco owned internet service providers isps providing their window to the world with portals designed to push users to content owned by the isp in question or by one of its partners it didnt work because users soon found that there was much more to the web than what the isp was pushing and companies and individuals were quick to exploit the open architecture of the web to develop alternative destinations and applications those market dynamics led to the environment we have today in which consumers build a relationship with the brands that suit them rather than the isp
2924749 just as they experienced exponential data traffic and revenue mobile operators will experience the same which will more than make up for the narrowing margins in their voice business
2924750 we have already seen this with japanese operator ntt docomo which has taken the innovative approach of opening up its network to approximately 17 000 service providers and has seen data revenues increase correspondingly
2924751 social networks are becoming the first stop for people who want to talk about media experiences
2924752 were excited volantis is providing an easy and effective way for us to extend our mobile portal content and services across these communities this solution will convert activity into revenue
2924753 facebook platform provides a new channel for customer acquisition increased content sales and increased average revenue per user

2924755 this integration further solidifies our commitment to providing our clients and partners the best mobile measurement and analysis services
2924756 we are excited to add bango analytics to our growing list of third party reporting and analytics partners our decktrade customers will benefit from being able to leverage the response of each campaign to then reinvest where they see the strongest performance
2924757 bluetooth is a key capability in mobile devices but at present it is not always clear which devices can connect to other devices or accessories for different wireless features

2924895 los jinetes son experimentados iturriaga y ricardo stangher quien tambi n se clasific para completo pero su caballo
2924896 la idea es seguir hasta el final para seguir recogiendo experiencia
2924897 una de las grandes cosas que nos llevamos tras estos meses de concentraci n hacia los juegos es ver c mo los caballos son preparados la tecnolog a que utilizan en el proceso
2924898 es fundamental el apoyo de los mozos que en muchos casos son veterinarios hay grandes grupos detr s del animal y un gran profesionalismo
2924899 tienes que venir con tres o cuatro pruebas completas previas para que el caballo lo afronte como un ejercicio m s y que no sea algo tan dif cil
2924900 nosotros nos preparamos antes de venir pero los tipos de salto de beas river nos hicieron pensar mucho c mo afrontarlos
2924901 fue una buena presentaci n aqu en el cross tres jinetes han pasado la prueba
2924902 llegar con tres jinetes a salto es positivo porque nos permite puntuar por equipos adem s de individual
2924903 el tiempo de hoy fue muy bueno nublado y no muy caliente los caballos no tuvieron problemas
2924904 en esta pista los espa oles podemos hacer da o

2924912 fue un partido fuerte pero poco a poco hemos ido tomando m s confianza en los partidos y seguiremos as porque vamos a luchar por el oro
2924913 ellas tienen un gran equipo hoy ganamos nosotras porque jugamos mejor pero eso no nos garantiza nada si las enfrentamos otra vez
2924914 nuestros saques nos ayudaron a ganar este partido pero ya eso es cosa del pasado ahora la concentraci n est totalmente en el pr ximo encuentro que es contra china y uno de los m s importantes que tendremos
2924915 bien tranquilo un poco dif cil porque no conoc a al rival pero bueno no tuve problemas creo que fue una primera ronda suficientemente buena

2924923 es muy importante para l y para jason porque en atenas no ganamos
2924924 hemos jugado mejor que contra polonia se nota que es el segundo partido y que le estamos cogiendo el ritmo a la competici n hemos jugado muy en equipo y sin demasiados fallos esa ha sido la clave de obtener la victoria
2924925 creo que no ha habido ninguna que se haya destacado por jugar mejor o peor que las otras ha sido una victoria de equipo de trabajo unido y vuelvo a repetir de pocos fallos
2924926 de todas formas tenemos que seguir mejorando si queremos estar arriba tenemos que ser m s r pidos m s constantes m s resolutivos en algunos momentos en los juegos ol mpicos no te puedes reservar ante nadie hay grandes equipos y tienes que jugar d ndolo todo
2924927 eso nadie lo puede saber todos los equipos trabajamos para llegar en las mejores condiciones posibles pero es muy duro jugar partidos importantes cada dos d as casi no hay tiempo de recuperaci n

2924998 so many people are fed up with todays options for girls and the short window for girlhood

2925000 it was a very very very different life than mine
2925001 she got to ride horses she had a mom and dad that stayed at the house more often and sisters that werent really mean to her
2925002 there was a little doll made of corn or something

2925008 girls do have wiis nintendo at 9 i wanted a canopy bed and a pony my daughter wants an iphone this is the world our girls live in there is more of a challenge more media more culture to assimilate and tease out and so much of it is very appealing
2925009 theres something to be said about pastimes that girls have always had to remember some of that too its nice that sometimes they can have very solitary creative pursuits without having to blog about it
2925010 for a girl to be earnest about what she likes to speak up it is kind of daring to include a recipe in a book for girls when we know so much about how girls are limited its daring to reclaim these things this everyday daring like raising your hand in class

2925027 the problem in the past has been the expense of geothermal energy generation
2925028 the pipes affect the migration of wild animals and where we can graze our cattle
2925029 now they are drilling wells on either side of our valley it scares off the animals also the vegetation has changed
2925030 the huge benefits of course are that you are getting indigenous electricity which doesnt rely on expensive oil imports
2925031 the other benefit is that you dont get any co2 emissions
2925032 we have intensified exploration of geothermal resources because we want to find a way to bring the cost of power down and hopefully bring in investors by 2030 at least 80 of kenyans will have power

2925040 all day today theyve been bombing georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting the civilian population and we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all around the country
2925041 is not about georgia anymore its about america its values america stands up for those freedom loving nations and supports them thats what america is all about
2925042 now we see georgia has found a use for these weapons and for the special forces that were trained with the help of international instructors
2925043 i think our european and american colleagues should understand what is happening and i hope very much that they will reach the right conclusions
2925044 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2925045 we underscore the international communitys support for georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders
2925046 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2925047 a return by the parties to the status quo of august the 6th
2925048 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire
2925049 for many years i have warned against russian actions that undermine the sovereignty of its neighbours
2925050 commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia
2925051 those who have been supplying arms to georgia i believe they should feel part of the blame for the loss of life of civilians including many russian citizens and peacekeepers i think those who have been appeasing mr saakashvilis aggressive intentions and who helped create a feeling of impunity among the georgian leadership should think twice
2925052 you cant pretend to win the title if youre always starting from the sixth position

2925079 we are both so happy to have two british girls on the podium i dont think either of us expected it and especially a gold and a bronze its absolutely amazing
2925080 it hasnt sunk in yet im just over the moon
2925081 i didnt really know what to expect this morning because it was a hard swim last night to get into the final for two british girls to get on the podium is amazing and i am so happy for both of us its great for british swimming
2925082 it was a lot harder this morning we just tried to ignore the times and race the final
2925083 i dont think either of us are natural sprinters we dont do the 100m free so we are naturally suited to the back half of the race
2925084 we didnt panic when we were a little bit behind i didnt see anyone past katie i didnt know what was going on i couldnt see what there was on the other side of the pool i saw katie and just tried to catch her
2925085 i went out a bit slow yesterday so i wanted to go faster today and managed to hold on
2925086 im confident i like being the underdog i like going in and being someone that no one really recognises
2925087 i knew there was a small chance someone would pull out and i just smashed my pb there so im really happy
2925088 i found out last night at 10pm so that had me up for another two hours
2925089 i was mostly relieved and then i knew i could make the final im feeling a bit lucky in this meet so hopefully if all goes well you never know what can happen anyone in the final is going for a medal and thats what im going to be doing
2925090 the last 12 hours have been an emotional rollercoaster for me but anything that doesnt kill you makes you stronger im gaining all the experience i need so im really happy
2925091 hes a man with a plan got a counterfeit dollar in his hand hes misstra know it all
2925092 we did not feel safe with her acting that way

2925099 because a thing is difficult for you to do do not think it is impossible for any man but whatever is possible for any man to do and right for his nature think that you can it too
2925100 yeah if its in bills nature to bench press a bulldozer then of necessity it is also in your nature
2925101 success seems to be largely a matter of hanging on long after others have let go
2925102 immerse yourself in something deeply and with heartfelt intensity continually improve never give up this is fulfillment this is success
2925103 i was wholly fulfilled and i realized that most people never get there because theyre afraid to demand enough of themselves and take the easy road
2925104 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming
2925105 if i get out of bed and eat properly and do some exercise then i will eventually lose bodyfat
2925106 avoid the times when there have been really rancorous debates in the confirmation process
2925107 i would be very direct with president putin that these actions will have consequences long term in terms of our relationship with russia and it is in violation of the norms of international conduct
2925108 a genuinely neutral mediator not the russian government must begin a process of negotiations immediately
2925109 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2925110 wow i think you have to be superman to do that
2925111 dad why are those guys not wearing clothes theyre not being respectable

2925113 its a place to come relax and get away from baseball for a couple of hours
2925114 same as you im here to get those files and get paid
2925115 what other reason is there to do this sort of stuff
2925116 how are these files going to make the world better
2925117 they show how all the corporations around the world are dependent on each other it helps to find the weaknesses of each if one can be taken the others will fold chao sonic is just one of many
2925118 we dont have the time for this the guards will be here anytime now
2925119 you can leave as soon as i have the files
2925120 i couldve have killed you before im leaving with the files and theres nothing that you can do about it

2925123 in order to prevent the circumstances in which ukraine could be drawn into a military conflict ukraine reserves the right to bar ships which may take part in these actions from returning to the ukrainian territory until the conflict is solved
2925124 it makes a third party involved and its quite unexpected
2925125 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia
2925126 i was on duty in the guard room when the other boys outside began shouting i went out to see what the commotion was about and could see thirteen craft in the skies
2925127 they were zig zagging but i filmed two before they disappeared they were like rotating cubes with multiple colours
2925128 i made a full report to my commanding officers and gave them my footage the other lads were as amazed by it as i was
2925129 i saw these things flying in the sky and i told my guard commander
2925130 there were about 30 lights passing over for a few minutes very high but not at a great speed they were bright red another soldier saw them too
2925131 we deal with any ufo sightings to see if there was a military threat
2925132 they werent from this world they made no sound and had flashing dots inside
2925133 but when i looked closer it was clear they werent im not into sci fi but they werent from this planet
2925134 the mod and civil aviation authority need to look at this
2925135 they need to interview witnesses analyse the film and check both civil and military radar to see if any unusual activity was logged
2925136 an important factor is that this was shot from a military base and the military tend to make good witnesses
2925137 this object seems to be pulsing through virtually the entire spectrum and thats unusual its not something an ordinary aircraft or satellite would do and its too slow to be a meteor or a shooting star
2925138 the first thing you see is four lights in a symmetrical shape thats quite a coincidence if they are separate objects
2925139 if they were balloons or chinese lanterns its highly unlikely theyd form a shape like that one option is that were actually seeing lights attached to the underside of a vast craft
2925140 after the near miss with the police helicopter the time has come for a proper inquiry not least because of flight safety issues

2925162 we found one variant to be associated with weight and lean mass in both ethnic groups this variant was also associated with height total fat mass and hdl cholesterol but only in european american women a different variant was associated with triglyceride levels and hdl cholesterol in african american women
2925163 insects store fat like mammals do as lipid droplets accumulated in the fat body the functional equivalent of both mammalian liver and white adipose tissue
2925164 drosophila share many components of fat biosynthesis degradation and regulation with humans including many of those implicated in diabetes and obesity
2925165 if we can stop the signal for the proliferation of uncontrolled growth of the cells then we can stop the leukaemia in its tracks
2925166 the impact of poor diet inactivity and obesity on medical costs labour productivity and national production are very large
2925167 this provides concrete evidence of the ongoing shift in india market where distributors of indian manufacturing companies have become importers from china
2925168 so far there are still few industries less affected to the extent than other industries but as china move up the value added chain and continue to offer attractive price points imports growth rates which we now have seen may in the near term could grow at a more rapid pace

2925170 george is pro palestinian and he is also urging barack to withdraw unconditionally from iraq if he wins
2925171 his hope of becoming americas first black president depends heavily on winning over conservative voters and it would be suicidal for him to be perceived as a tool of a hollywood leftie which is how they regard george
2925172 george is a master at crafting his own image and he is helping obama to hone his image both domestically and abroad he has tried to keep the true extent of their involvement out of the press because he is frightened of alienating voters
2925173 now the population of the bangladeshi migrants has reached to about threerore the bjp is of the view that in the whole of northeast a national register of citizen should be created and create identity cards for them the indian government should speak to its bangladeshi counterpart to form a process to detect the illegal migrants and deport them

2925175 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda
2925176 she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
2925177 the doctors were working on him they tried to resuscitate him two times one time he came back for about an hour then he went into cardiac arrest the second time
2925178 what she will treasure the most is the fact that she was his wife for 30 years and not only was she his wife but she was his best friend shes going to miss him dearly
2925179 no previous convictions rather than exemplary good character if what i read about him and the use of drugs is true
2925180 now that we have access to intermediates that were not previously available people will want to do careful studies on their pharmacological activity and we were getting yields of 100 to 200 milligrams per litre which is respectable for potentially valuable molecules with relatively simple optimisation of the fermentation you could obtain 10 or 100 times more than this
2925181 its very exciting that plant alkaloid pathways are starting to be reconstituted in microbes very importantly smolke has also shown how this strain can be used to discover new enzymes that catalyse biosynthetic transformations
2925182 we are now hoping to extend the pathway both ways to get a broader range of intermediates downstream including the end products and to be able to start with simpler substrates upstream
2925183 the system will also allow us to start producing non natural alkaloids by using enzymes from different sources and in combinations that do not occur in nature
2925184 usually it takes three men and two months to build any type of ship but this time we needed at least five to 10 builders to work on it over eight months to make it ready it was a hard but enjoyable job
2925185 the most difficult part will be circumnavigating around the cape of good hope where many shipwrecks are testimony to the difficult conditions there
2925186 you can get big waves of 20 metres or more there it is a dangerous area and well be there in december and january

2925188 we are heading out on two expeditions each close to a month long to map the full length of the cayman trough
2925189 it is the worlds deepest volcanic ridge and totally unexplored
2925190 we are hoping to find several different types of vents along the ridge
2925191 some of the vents will be very similar in depth to the vents we already know about and because the conditions will be alike we might expect very similar animals
2925192 the deep ocean is our planets largest ecosystem if we are going to use its resources responsibly then we need understand what determines its patterns of life

2925195 helmut hofer has taken a leading role in the development of symplectic geometry one of the most exciting areas of mathematics today
2925196 his combination of geometric insight and deep analytical skills together with his energy and enthusiasm has provided inspiration for many other mathematicians we are delighted that he will be joining the faculty of our school of mathematics
2925197 the fields of symplectic geometry symplectic topology and related hamiltonian dynamics have enjoyed dramatic advances in the last 20 years helmut hofer is one of the main architects of these developments together with his engaging style energy record of collaborations and mentorship his addition to the faculty of the school of mathematics will position the institute as a center for these areas
2925198 the institute is a unique place and i am thrilled to join its faculty

2925206 hes had a trail of stunning women running around after him and has been the life and soul of every party hes been to in the last week
2925207 i am not sure how many countries would have either the resources or indeed the controlled resources to put on an event like this
2925208 i doubt we will have 20 000 people doing things in unison in our opening ceremony thats just fine thats the beauty of the contrast
2925209 i have it at home i if you want to
2925210 i can i can go home and drop it off your house after school
2925211 theres no need for that mr choi i live too faraway
2925212 i guess youd be able to fetch it for me
2925213 the question is whether our fellow citizens will do more than just pour concrete
2925214 you can show them to your friends and then they go straight into the outside trash
2925215 is the mark up to pay higher commissions justifiable or is it another money game that is designed to recruit sales people who recruit sales people who have to buy the product in order to qualify for their commissions

2925217 we are feeling on top of the world and we cannot put our joy in words he has done the nation proud and also his city chandigarh
2925218 it has been a tale of sweat extremely hard work and keeping himself going in pressure conditions that has made abhinav a real champion today he fought back his back problem and we put him through a commando type of training which has given good result
2925219 we are really feeling on top of the world at the moment we are planning big celebrations once he comes back
2925220 we will continue our rally until the puppet government is booted out
2925221 thaksins exile is another victory for us but our ultimate goal is to finish off the thaksin regime by kicking out his puppet government
2925222 i am not aware by this development and came to know only through the media
2925223 we would go out to heards lane to have picnics
2925224 ive asked la marque to give up the road in their extraterritorial jurisdiction
2925225 but they voted against it the road has no value its a state right of way were not planning on building a hotel on it
2925226 i sat here monday before the storm and clocked one at 83 mph one at 76 mph and another at 90 mph
2925227 early in the mornings and late in the evenings its like a racetrack
2925228 the city council felt like it was something they didnt want to relinquish
2925229 i would have to send our reserve officers to court and they work other jobs during the day
2925230 we had a second crew for about a month in january to see if there was a call volume for it
2925231 from the feedback we got from the first responders they could see a dramatic change
2925232 has a collection rate of 3 percent over the national average
2925233 we would look at a 200 000 or 300 000 a year increase in revenue
2925234 we applied last year and theres 13 million dollars still out there but there were 2 500 applicants
2925235 i told him that i dont sleep around but he kept insisting on having sex with me he later loosened his belt and unzipped his trousers to expose his private parts
2925236 we have ruled out armed robbery because the boy still had his cellphone and money when we found him
2925237 we need an all purpose building to serve the same things that it did for 55 or 60 years in our community
2925238 we feel without that our history is being cut short
2925239 i dont know really if the city ought to have the ability to heat food in every building we have
2925240 ovens especially food preparation is a problem its messy its hard to clean up after and food and gymnasiums and people eating on gymnasium floors is probably not real conducive
2925241 we were ushered across the street and told our families would be arrested
2925242 run us over here to these places that are already overbooked and overcrowded
2925243 its a hard sell when you tear down whats considered to be a landmark in the african american community
2925244 its an even harder sell when you tear it down and dont replace it with exactly what it once was
2925245 weve made progress in america and i think as a sign of our progress we take advantage of the things our forefathers fought for
2925246 i think having similar buildings within 100 yards of each other is not good business on behalf of the city but im going to talk to our folks talk to city commissioners and meet with lynn ray and see if we cant get something that will make them happy
2925247 i would hate to think it was a black and white issue because this new sanders center is going to be open to the entire city of texas city
2925248 roger dubuis watches are highly innovative in terms of movements and design as a young business it is very different from the more established specialist watchmakers within the group today as such it complements our maisons perfectly
2925249 we scored that lead two years ago so im not sure
2925250 successfully hedged our exposure to this through our ability to transfer skills to the public sector infrastructure market and redirected housing market strategy
2925251 showing a pleasing acceleration in the rate of trading in the second half
2925252 the palestinian leadership has been working on establishing a palestinian state within the 67 borders
2925253 if israel continues to oppose making this a reality then the palestinian demand for the palestinian people and its leadership would be one state a binational state
2925254 we do think there are many witnesses because at that time around 7 p m there were a lot of people in the park or in the surroundings of the park
2925255 there were also people who were part of the altercation and many people playing sports or just sitting in the park
2925256 its too early to say what happened exactly were talking about the death of a man its a major investigation
2925257 to me that was a strong indication of her love she is a fabulous person
2925258 very very very happy to report her condition is upgraded
2925259 theyre not at the point where they want to discuss the specific nature of the injuries
2925260 we are extremely grateful for the outpouring of assistance and generosity that we have received and hope to convey our appreciation to everyone who has supported us and kept us in their thoughts and prayers
2925261 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts

2925268 he was talking slowly and very dry he hadnt taken anything in his mouth since he got hurt and he was going into surgery
2925269 his five siblings went to college and he could have done so as well but this is what he wanted
2925270 it wasnt mom and dads favorite but we have no regrets its been good for him
2925271 nobodys really there to back you up in the state
2925272 to the extent that they are relevant and presented to a hearing officer during a hearing such complaints could be taken into account in disciplining a contractor
2925273 since we are dealing with an individuals livelihood we take care to provide a full fair and professional hearing and issue a like written decision this process takes time

2925276 the many millions who tuned in for the opening ceremony are a good omen for that and the encouraging news continued with the audience figures for the first full day of action
2925277 the olympic opening ceremony captivated the american public in unprecedented numbers for a non u s
2925278 it was a magical and memorable spectacle and a great way to start the
2925279 the healthy human mouth is home to a tremendous variety of microbes including viruses fungi protozoa and bacteria
2925280 the bacteria are the most numerous there are 100 million in every millilitre of saliva and more than 600 different species in the mouth around half of these have yet to be named and we are trying to describe and name the new species
2925281 interestingly this species was isolated from within the oral tissues both in oral cancers and normal healthy tissue
2925282 this confirms other work showing that oral bacteria can invade both tissues and individual cells
2925283 a detailed description and name for each species of bacteria are needed so that different laboratories can recognise all of the bacterial species present in the mouth
2925284 im looking forward to having more races as is planned for the future
2925285 though i wouldnt mind missing one or two tests actually the tests have been reduced quite a lot over the last two or three years but i hope we have more races because there is not one that i dont like
2925286 im looking forward to going to india and the other interesting new places currently being discussed
2925287 the american team havent left yet their plane had a cracked windscreen
2925288 to me phelps is way above that level because the sport is so much more competitive now like in other sports hes the kind of athlete who comes along once in a century
2925289 hes definitely on the verge of something special i think eight golds is very feasible for him
2925290 he really does a wonderful job at taking one day at a time and attacking whatevers in front of him for that day
2925291 i like to see him challenged because that really brings out his best
2925292 if they gave black belts for handling pressure hes about a sixth degree black belt

2925295 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2925296 it was a pretty good first week im pretty sore now so i know what to expect now coming out
2925297 i learned a lot and corrected a lot of mistakes
2925298 obviously i want to win that starting job but the biggest thing for me is to just focus on myself and try to improve every day and if that happens then i think ill be in pretty good shape
2925299 were looking closely to identify maybe 18 guys on offense and 18 guys on defense who we can put in the ballgame to keep everybody fresh
2925300 var vill du vara om 1 r utan f r ndring r du d r du r idag
2925301 weve messed around before but it takes a little while to get used to one another
2925302 theyre good hitters and they can adapt obviously its going to work itself out but the first couple of practices take a little bit of getting used to
2925303 i thought everybody looked pretty good for the first day it didnt look like a typical first day we got some young players but they held their own everybody reported in pretty good shape it was very very encouraging
2925304 the afternoon session was a little rough around the edges
2925305 for the first day you dont expect much but were just so far away from being ready as a team
2925306 im just working hard and doing the same things i did last year but getting better at it i think its getting there i dont think my technique is where i want it to be yet but each day that we come in here im going to get better
2925307 i think i always have it with me its just a matter of you know you just get a little rusty and a couple days back and you feel ok
2925308 my expectations were that we came here to work and its not a slow start we just come out and play
2925309 its competing for our spots and you just cant expect to progress slowly and get a starting spot you gotta get it now
2925310 i kind of expected kananis numbers to be what she produced today offensively ball control and defensively she was fine just gotta work a little bit offensively which i fully expected
2925311 i remember former uh associate coach charlie wade saying she could probably play right now in college as a high school sophomore
2925312 she would be right up there with the freshmen on our team she already had that potential
2925313 ive coached her in club for 2 1 2 years
2925314 at the club level when she was on she was unstoppable one of the top three kids in her class
2925315 she is the highest jumper on our team the best volleyball player in the gym as far as passing and getting the ball to the setter she has been playing a long time what has hurt her is she has been so physical for so long that she could be mechanically flawed in high school and it didnt matter she got her kills anyway thats not the case now
2925316 we did our time where we sat all the way at the top and barely could see anything
2925317 then we got to move down toward the bottom we saw all the great players from robyn ah mow to heather bown and kim willoughby
2925318 i was like look at that the university of hawaii is playing the front row at the olympics
2925319 it was awesome it only gives us hope and inspiration of what our college can do
2925320 im very excited that now i have the opportunity to do that for the university who knows whats going to happen i can only hope that there will come a time ill get my opportunity
2925321 can give a team the all around presence that you need
2925322 she genuinely cares for the well being of her team
2925323 she has an idea in her mind of what she wants and shell go after it
2925324 weve had numerous talks after club practice when she was not happy with the way things were going and shed ask what can i do so my teammates are as fired up as i am
2925325 the most special quality about her is she doesnt want to give up she wants everybody to play at the same level she is we need someone out there who is getting after them whether its a freshman or a senior i think people will respect the fact that she goes hard all the time and goes after every ball
2925326 omg i love these little lego dudes what are they supposed to be
2925327 you know hes the director of the new movie clone wars
2925328 when anyone gets killed its sad but when its children its even sadder
2925329 the hearts and prayers of everyone go out to the parents and relatives of these children
2925330 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2925331 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2925332 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2925333 theres no cancellations out of the canadian side or the european side but the american cancellations are killing everybody
2925334 traditionally the dollar was 65 cents and fuel costs were low and so it was easy and we got spoiled for sure
2925335 ten years ago there were 40 to 60 nations really promoting their countries for tourism in an aggressive way and now weve got 100 countries promoting themselves and they also look to the u s as a very affluent economy
2925336 per la prima volta ho incontrato una pazza di me
2925337 this particular air force exercise is important because india is included among some very important allies
2925338 this is definitely an extension of an arc that has been mapped out since 2000 and it really signifies that what india and the united states have is a strategic relationship
2925339 pyongyang through its state run news agency the korean central news agency has consistently and passionately criticized such ventures accusing the united states of harboring hostile intentions toward north korea
2925340 beijing would likely remain reticent about such training since it does not see itself as directly and imminently affected by such activities
2925341 we will learn how our allies operate in response to similar threats
2925342 it will allow us to build observations to eventually learn those lessons about what it takes to integrate talk fly with employ deploy and sustain air power with places like india korea and france
2925343 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2925344 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2925345 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2925346 not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armour and increased attacks on tskhinvali
2925347 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on an unprecedented scale
2925348 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2925349 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2925350 not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armour and increased attacks on tskhinvali
2925351 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on an unprecedented scale
2925352 i was very firm with vladimir putin i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia
2925353 russian aggression must not go unanswered and its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2925354 the strengthening of the peacekeeping contingent has been ordered to prevent a repeat of the situation which happened with russian peacekeepers around tskhinvali
2925355 any face to face confrontation has been in russias interest we dont want to do that any more
2925356 is your governments objective regime change in georgia the overthrow of the democratically elected government of georgia
2925357 regime change is an american expression we do not use such an expression
2925358 sometimes there are occasions and we know from history that there are different leaders who come to power either democratically or semi democratically and they become an obstacle
2925359 we need russias co operation over iran and derailing that over a localised conflict in georgia makes no sense we just have to hope that diplomacy prevails the next necessary step is for russia to respond positively to georgias ceasefire declaration
2925360 i pay the bare minimum just to have a bed
2925361 if i want to have any kind of social life i need another job and if i want to eat i need another job

2925372 ill go out and drink and have fun but im also the kind of person that will have a small potluck and play board games i really like to balance it out

2925377 my dreams and my goals are not to be rich not to be famous not to be any of that

2925398 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2925399 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2925400 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2925401 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2925413 thanx to all of u who are genuinely concerned about the recent report of reginae being killed in a car accident it means a lot to our family to know that so many of u care calls have been coming in to our family all day amp are continuing to do so i am pleased to inform u that this report is false it is merely a rumor started by someone who obviously is miserable in their own skin that they would even have the notion to attack a child rest assured reginae is tucked away in her bed this very moment trying to get past the hurt this ugliness has caused her and our family its ironic however that although the evil hellbound expletive that started this hate mail did something like this to reginae she still said a special prayer for them 2nite this is naes aunt amp all of the responses that i wanted give all went out the window when i heard that prayer so to all of our extended family amp friends amp fans please join us in saying a special prayer for the lost soul who simply had nothing better to do be sure to include lord please forgive them for they know not what they do
2925414 rabbi we know that you are a teacher come from god for no one can do these signs that you do unless god is with him
2925415 most assuredly i say to you unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of god
2925416 how can a man be born when he is old can he enter a second time into his mothers womb and be born
2925417 most assuredly i say to you unless one is born of water and the spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of god
2925418 that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit
2925419 do not marvel that i said to you you must be born again
2925420 the wind blows where it wishes and you hear the sound of it but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes so is everyone who is born of the spirit
2925421 are you the teacher of israel and do not know these things

2925438 we want to be one of the biggest hotel groups in africa based on our ability to mobilise skills and competencies hence our decision to establish a hospitality school in sa which would be similar to a facility we are developing in equatorial guinea
2925439 we want to have at least 5800 rooms in africa by 2012 with up to 2000 in nigeria alone this compares with just 700 rooms in africa at present outside zimbabwe where we have 1800 rooms
2925440 we are building the balance sheet of each country that we operate in which is important as we want to be able to negotiate for funding in a stronger position our expansion in sa for example would be to have a good portfolio of properties that are well managed and can generate good returns
2925441 the whole transfer of vacant land issue is not an uncomplicated activity in the city
2925442 if youve got 40 000 vacant lots you cant possibly need all of them
2925443 in the order of crimes what they do is way way down the list
2925444 by doing it without asking permission were more likely to win that argument on our terms
2925445 if the owner of that land youve not asked to garden has neglected it
2925446 then they probably dont give a damn about the fact that youre now going to do something with it
2925447 on sunday mornings i come out and i get whatever vegetables im going to have for the day
2925448 which in this day and time is wonderful because with the economy the way it is this is a godsend
2925449 having to go to the supermarket so much having to put out so much money to get so little
2925450 a lot of people would rather see these areas used for something good anyway
2925451 i want a job that has benefits and better pay
2925452 oftentimes if a prison is located in a place where there arent a lot of jobs but there are a lot of women that are single and in many cases raising children on their own they dont have a lot of other opportunities
2925453 it was a job with job security thats why i took it
2925454 they see the women as easy prey they will flatter you theyll listen to everything you say and use it against you
2925455 but if you stay with it long enough and you are bright enough you learn to use words a lot and that can get you out of a lot of stuff
2925456 people have found over the years that women in a male prison have profoundly had a calming effect
2925457 men act differently when women are around its just a fact of life
2925458 early on i learned a lot of the guys although they were here for whatever the crime they still had respect for women they are not as ready to go physically at a woman as a man
2925459 nothing to do but watch you and if they know they can play you they will i constantly say take your hands out of your pants pull your pants up pull your shirt up but the more straightforward and professional you are the less problems you tend to have
2925460 my experience is they do the same job as the men and i dont see a disadvantage
2925461 but im tired of struggling so much you can make so much money here
2925462 i always thought it would be neat to have bees
2925463 i finally had a lot big enough to have bees
2925464 theres so few in new jersey and elsewhere for that matter
2925465 since then i get hundreds of pounds of apples from each tree every year
2925466 i get 20 to 30 pounds of raspberries from one bush and that is all because of the bees
2925467 there are definitely times when i do suit up and i never keep it far away
2925468 i went for almost eight years not knowing what was going on and then wh am
2925469 theres a face now behind the crime and im freaked out
2925470 its all circumstantial evidence but they have so much stuff on this guy
2925471 i requested not to go back to my old building
2925472 but there were no notes for what he was doing in the biological room
2925473 if that guy was so messed up in his head why were they letting him play with biological weapons up until last year
2925474 some one has to take the blame until then its not the end for me
2925475 in the video game industry if you sell a million copies you throw a ticker tape parade
2925476 if youre selling five to six million copies of the same title every year youve just won the super bowl world series and stanley cup combined
2925477 people who want to play with their favorite quarterback or their favorite team
2925478 hard core players can do hundreds of hours of labbing playing all the different teams to find an edge
2925479 theres a crazy amount of dedication to finding out ways to win this game
2925480 then its a race to figure out the game the players change but mostly its what ea does with the game the new features
2925481 mostly practice and reaction time and getting everything down so you dont have to think about it while youre playing
2925482 randy moss has a big advantage over any defensive back
2925483 just throw the ball up and hell go get it
2925484 im very competitive and i like to match wits with other opponents
2925485 i love to talk trash thats the best part of the game for me
2925486 if youre playing a good defensive back like antonio cromartie why would the ball go through his hands and hit him in the face
2925487 ea does it because they dont want the backs to have outrageous interception stats but its really annoying
2925488 it should balance out between someone with twitch skills and someone who knows football strategy
2925489 just unfurling a banner in tiananmen square took every ounce of courage i had
2925490 in some parts of china 10 000 yuan or about 1 400 is the price of life
2925491 they tried to block the view and asked us why are you doing this then they tried to take our banner
2925492 we said no and they threatened to put us in jail for five days
2925493 and theyre taking what little bit we have away from us
2925494 we didnt have the yard sale we couldnt we had nothing to sell
2925495 it was stolen and now somebody is selling it somewhere
2925496 the 15th district is so busy they are dealing with murders and everything else and this is not important
2925497 i walked the neighborhood as a committeewoman and said if youve got it take it inside because you wont have it tomorrow
2925498 framework for growth at verizon and a good standard of living with careers for our members
2925499 focused on delivering to our customers the best in broadband communications and entertainment
2925500 we applaud management for agreeing to keep the best health care coverage in america and for their commitment to work with us for real health care reform
2925501 met our goals to protect the retirees who helped to build this company and ensure future jobs for union members
2925502 i wanted to see the person who had done this there are moments when i am just mike nutter and i wanted him to know i am disgusted with who he is and what he has done
2925503 thats information that we keep very close to the vest like any organization would
2925504 so this board member wasnt privy to any of that
2925505 the very prototype of the new generation of black political stars
2925506 could be hard for a white journalist to understand all of the nuances of race
2925507 he looked over at his press secretary who is black and interrupted me
2925508 the park service does not have land use control over private land within its boundaries
2925509 but sometimes the park service gets confused it thinks its a great agency because it manages great places
2925510 the zoning changes and it used to be farmland and now its commercial development
2925511 and its a case where we could have acted and bought land five or 10 years ago and it would have never happened
2925512 when they drew the lines to create yellowstone it was a group of men sitting in an office in washington d c with a map and a ruler
2925513 when people visit the big parks they dont get the fact that the federal government doesnt own all the land
2925514 were going to push hard over the next five years for a commitment to protect these parks for future generations by buying these lands
2925515 you can have all the rangers in the world but if theyre interpreting a townhouse development it doesnt do much good
2925516 well you might get to play with somebody else if its an open mic night
2925517 helikopter dan tim sar sudah terbang ke lokasi kejadian tetapi hanya dapat mendarat di kampung ndundu karena cuaca buruk karena itu mereka kembali ke wamena dan selanjutnya ke jayapura jika cuaca sudah memungkinkan barulah mereka kembali ke lokasi untuk mengevakuasi jenazah pilot dave clapper
2925518 dari ndundu tim sar dan masyarakat harus berjalan kaki mendaki ke lokasi jatuhnya pesawat itu dan justeru untuk pergi ke sana cuaca tidak memungkinkan besok selasa 12 agustus kami coba lagi untuk mengevakuasi jenazah dave
2925519 no horse had ever gone undefeated won 15 in a row won the hambo it would have been really tough to get beat here i know theyre all going to get beat but i really wanted this one
2925520 its nice to accomplish this weve won one hambo its in the history books
2925521 i started in buffalo and i was basically starving to death racing a four claimer and not thinking about the hambletonian
2925522 when i first came down to new york i saw prakas i was racing at roosevelt and came over to see him win the 1985 hambletonian
2925523 i only sold half of dewey because i wanted to be back in the hambo
2925524 if you sell all your good ones you cant be back in this is what its all about
2925525 i probably would have rather come from behind but after i looked around i thought if im going to get beat i might as well get beat on the front end and then you have no excuses
2925526 id seen everyone was in the holes so i figured we could back them off the fractions which were pretty fast really
2925527 i had a big hold on him i didnt think i was going that much an opening quarter in 26 4 seconds
2925528 i think he crazed had enough clearance but that was my point
2925529 youre trying to use other horses as blockers and get more of a break thats the one thing about this place i won 11 races in a row here with dewey this is such a tough track you have to be an unbelievable horse to win so many youre coming down the lane youre trying to save as much horse as you can for the rest of the mile
2925530 i think 26 4 was a pretty quick first quarter
2925531 he tim tetrick driving crazed never had to use his horse and he still didnt get by his horse raced really well hes a good horse and id love to own him but my horse put him away i think if i was in the two hole i would have blown right by him my horse is actually better out of a hole i was definitely worried in the stretch
2925532 i didnt want to get beat falling asleep in the hambletonian i knew crazed has a good brush i was backing into him on the last turn trying to keep him trapped in a little bit about a quarter of a way down the lane i asked dewey to go hes just a tough horse and he when he gets to that point he wants to fight i dont know what the win was by but i knew i won
2925533 i used him too early if i had sat in he would have won and i would have been able to pick my post instead of getting the 10 i told dan driver daniel dube to sit in with him hes going to give you one wicked quarter he will pass horses he made up eight in the lane at yonkers to finish second in the yonkers trot hes just a good little horse who races tough every week
2925534 in his fifth start here i had to hit him twice
2925535 i put him in a bad spot in the final of the new jersey sire stakes he came home from about eighth and in the last 10 feet he had to get up and i gave him a couple of shots and i knew hed respond this was the second time he ever felt the stick
2925536 i think he has a shot of beating 1 50 out west in either kentucky or duquoin especially if someone cuts some of the fractions for him because hes definitely better from behind
2925537 im not going to dodge any bullets to keep him unbeaten
2925538 nbc was out at the farm and for four hours i rode him swam him he jogged and he just stood there
2925539 thats just his best quality hes just got such a good disposition
2925540 probably up until thursday i must have had 50 calls a day guys want to see dewey and film him
2925541 people are very nice but after a while you do get tired of it i said i cant imagine what an nfl quarterback before the super bowl goes through
2925542 i made history no horse ever went undefeated won 15 in a row won the hambletonian it would have been really tough to get beat here i know theyre all going to get beat but i really wanted this one
2925543 hes got his own apartment he can walk in and out of a half acre paddock any time he wants i might even get up and ride him a bit its a great feeling hes a special horse you ride him and he just enjoys it most sunday mornings i get up at 6 30 or 7 and take him for a ride its fun we put him in a paddock with a pond and he takes a dip here and there
2925544 the german and french governments need to reflect on how their veto of georgias nato membership at the bucharest summit in april encouraged mikheil saakashvili to take unilateral military action believing nobody else would help him recover territory belonging to georgia
2925545 for bringing our great bargaining power to bear on leaders of client states to do things they ought to do but dont want to do
2925546 we get a lot of out of the country and out of town visitors that will stop by and see it
2925547 theres some attraction from the tourism factor of it being associated with route 66
2925548 weve had some problems with break ins out there and we can no longer afford to have a security guard on duty
2925549 the people who break into the vehicles know that when people park there theres a 20 minute walk to the middle of the bridge
2925550 weve had no major incidences on the bridge that we were not able to get to quickly and handle like any other disorder
2925551 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward
2925552 were really stuck with the idea that we want to look progressive and modern and cosmopolitan but we also want to play up our romantic past
2925553 in 1908 denver was trying to have it both ways
2925554 i think thats part of our civic psychology its deep in our civic dna
2925555 were trying to show off the kind of flavor of what the west has to offer
2925556 the fact is our economy now is extremely diversified resilient and contemporary
2925557 people assume an international cosmopolitan image is at variance with the notion of being a cow town
2925558 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward
2925559 were really stuck with the idea that we want to look progressive and modern and cosmopolitan but we also want to play up our romantic past
2925560 in 1908 denver was trying to have it both ways
2925561 i think thats part of our civic psychology its deep in our civic dna
2925562 were trying to show off the kind of flavor of what the west has to offer
2925563 the fact is our economy now is extremely diversified resilient and contemporary
2925564 people assume an international cosmopolitan image is at variance with the notion of being a cow town
2925565 the national western stock show isnt partisan it doesnt take sides
2925566 its an opportunity to bring people of all different backgrounds culture races together thats what the west is really about
2925567 what happened today is important not only for bolivians but for all latin americans
2925568 i dedicate this victory to all the revolutionaries in the world
2925569 try to go ahead with the fight against poverty or it could just entrench the situation further
2925570 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2925571 as the person who knows him best michelle will talk about the barack obama she knows and loves the values that drive him and why she believes hell be an extraordinary president
2925572 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward
2925573 were really stuck with the idea that we want to look progressive and modern and cosmopolitan but we also want to play up our romantic past
2925574 in 1908 denver was trying to have it both ways
2925575 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
2925576 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
2925577 the mood of the country is very sour about the current administration people dont like the party as much as they did four years ago
2925578 abhinav bindra has done india proud by winning the first ever individual gold medal in the 10m air rifle event on monday morning and all of us are proud of him
2925579 theres no doubt that the stability and calm has created a good atmosphere that has allowed us to make more summer camps and oversee the youths
2925580 to me that was a strong indication of her love she is a fabulous person
2925581 very very very happy to report her condition is upgraded
2925582 theyre not at the point where they want to discuss the specific nature of the injuries
2925583 we are extremely grateful for the outpouring of assistance and generosity that we have received and hope to convey our appreciation to everyone who has supported us and kept us in their thoughts and prayers
2925584 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts
2925585 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
2925586 yes its a little disappointing i knew i was in a marginal seat and the fact that the swing has gone against the party has probably cost me my seat
2925587 its another chapter of my life thats closed and well move on from there
2925588 when you take on a job as a minister there are some tough decisions to be made
2925589 i felt that the decisions that were made in my portfolio were for the betterment of the northern territory people its created jobs and its helped the economy and thats what its all about when you step into the shoes of a minister
2925590 the major issues weve got are no different now to what they were before the election including roads and infrastructure and regional health services and a commitment to a live export trade
2925591 its really going to be very important from now on that someone does pay a lot of attention to the issues and listens
2925592 if its a close call in parliament any issues we have on the table will be debated quite strongly thats going to be a natural occurrence when youve got a situation like we potentially may have
2925593 troops had killed 60 ltte terrorists and 28 were wounded from sundays confrontations
2925594 the death injuries and loss due to this attack typical when sri lanka air force bombs a heavily populated area in vanni have been repeated more than one hundred times over the vanni area over a period of two years
2925595 the whole issue was created by separatist leaders who would like to stop the hindu pilgrimage the real motive is a complete islamisation of the valley after having successfully forced kashmiri hindus to leave the valley
2925596 this is not a struggle merely for 100 acres of land this is the struggle for the identity of our motherland
2925597 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2925598 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2925599 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2925600 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2925601 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2925602 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country
2925603 im sure all of our guys are having a rough time with it
2925604 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2925605 at present we do not know anything about how the explosions occurred and we are waiting to learn about its cause
2925606 we werent even advised that they were going to be there
2925607 they just moved in and weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen
2925608 there certainly is a level of isi complicity in the militant areas in pakistan and organisations such as the taliban
2925609 i cant say to what level of leadership that goes to but there are indications of complicity on the part of isi to the extent that they are facilitating these militant groups that come out of the tribal areas in pakistan
2925610 unfortunately we see a higher number of non pashtun non afghanistan fighters this year than this time last year
2925611 they are really from a variety of ethnic groupings some are from areas in pakistan some are from places like uzbekistan or chechnya some are from europe and some are from other arab countries
2925612 but when you have a problem of porous borders and fighters and weapons and resources and command and control and logistics being brought in from outside of afghanistan that adds a complicating context to the insurgency
2925613 we come with militaries that have advantages in command and control in speed in lethality in logistics in intelligence in all those things
2925614 if nations provide forces with restrictions what it does is it decreases those advantages
2925615 how fast we can get there i dont know but it is important that the international community remain committed to afghanistan
2925616 the u n secretary general is profoundly concerned over mounting tensions in the abkhaz zone of conflict
2925617 precision strikes against military infrastructure in order to prevent georgian aircraft and military attack on our peacekeepers
2925618 we want to force the georgian leadership to peace and what we see right now on the ground is that georgian troops not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armor and increased attacks on tskhinvali
2925619 my administration has been engaged with both sides of this trying to get a ceasefire
2925620 for his governments restraint offers of cease fire and disengagement of georgian forces from the zone of conflict in the south ossetian region of the country
2925621 the vice president told president saakashvili that russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community

2925643 xianz is like a big church it is a place that i can come to have fellowship with friends
2925644 i wanted to provide a safe alternative that was family friendly for the christian demographic
2925645 it is not just change in how we compute or communicate rather it is a potentially radical shirt in who is in control of information experience and resources
2925646 life will be happier for the on line individual because the people whom one interacts most strongly will be selected more by commonality of interests and goals than by accidents of proximity
2925647 youths exposed to violent media tend to become more aggressive immediately after exposure and become more aggressive adults
2925648 the military conflict in georgia is the key factor in pushing up oil prices this morning so much has happened so quickly since we first heard of russias attack last week
2925649 there is also some degree of a technical rebound after oils sharp fall on friday
2925650 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2925651 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2925652 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity

2925664 what happened to my family and me is like fruit from a poisonous tree the fruit will also be poisoned
2925665 there is a continuation of dictatorship in managing thai politics which is followed by interference in the justice system
2925666 it was kind of a no brain decision for us
2925667 a major reason was to avoid the transportation costs which are terrible
2925668 this should be a wholesome development for the us for it promises both political stability for the worlds largest country and continuing opportunities for the us to export to and invest in the worlds fastest growing economy

2925673 mindfulness is a certain way of paying attention that is healing that is restorative that is reminding you of who you actually are so that you dont wind up getting entrained into being a human doing rather than a human being
2925674 when we learn to focus our attention completely in the present we make an amazing discovery problems we thought were huge begin to shrink and old compulsions we thought we could never break out of fall away we find we have a breathing space between stimulus and response we no longer blow up when frustrated because we are going slow enough to control the situation we no longer cling to a moment of enjoyment but let things come and go in the natural rhythm of circumstances

2925722 at all sort of critical moments when there have been repeated russian provocations randy was a calming influence
2925723 we pulled out our troops after they had completed the task of cleaning theyre out theyre out
2925724 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2925725 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2925726 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a cease fire and termination of hostilities
2925727 not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armor and increased attacks on tskhinvali
2925728 we are excited that this piece has become a hot topic for both the media and the public and we find it insane that paris has the country discussing energy policy
2925729 dont let sacramento politicians remove products from your grocery bag

2925734 there are limitations to everything that you do and you do them for business reasons and you dont want people to fall through the cracks but you cant make everything available to everybody at all times
2925735 what were doing is a maximizing our rights for the olympics and b maximizing the exposure where we can but there are parts of this that are out of our control certainly

2925739 the richly layered soundscapes that trifonic have recorded might not be the right choice to play at your neighbors bar mitzvah but theyre perfect to escape from the oxidation that the modern world has a tendency of depositing
2925740 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2925741 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2925742 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2925743 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2925744 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2925745 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2925746 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2925747 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2925748 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2925749 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2925750 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2925751 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2925752 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2925753 you can microwave a pop tart that just blew me away that you could do that how long does it take to toast a pop tart a minute and a half if you want it dark people dont have that kind of time listen if you need to zap fry your pop tarts before you head out the door you might want to loosen up your schedule

2925762 se trata de um fracasso dizer que foi um bom resultado negar a realidade claro que um fracasso
2925763 ainda restam duas provas a final do 100 m e dos 200 m costas
2925764 em dunquerque campeonato da fran a disputado em abril o 400 de manaudou n o havia sido bom mas os 200 m foi genial
2925765 estou orgulhoso de meus filhos deram o seu melhor sab amos que ia ser complicado tudo decidido nos pequenos detalhes t cnicos um toque uma posi o na linha que permite o norte americano jason lesak deslizar sobre a gua coisas que os norte americanos sabem fazer muito bem
2925766 i obviously played nicely i shot 69 68 on a tough sunday at a major so im pretty happy about that
2925767 unfortunately i obviously came up a little bit short but i guess thats the way things go sometimes
2925768 so the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
2925769 i said it before theres guys that get a little bit fortunate they get in contention in a major and manage to get things going their way either because they play well or because somebody else comes back and unfortunately it hasnt happened to me
2925770 obviously i was trying to win but its not disappointing its hard luck but what can do there can only be one winner
2925771 im fine i was worse after the open championship last year because i lost it there on the back nine
2925772 but when you give it your best and dont win its hard luck but you feel good
2925773 i feel like i played well enough to win more than probably more than two majors throughout my career unfortunately it hasnt happened
2925774 that doesnt mean that im not in the right track
2925775 dia moreno sudah cukup tahu apa yang akan dia lakukan
2925776 you have to remember that to be a right winger you have to fail science
2925777 thats possibly the dumbest comment ive seen in a while
2925778 you have to remember that to be a right winger you have to fail science
2925779 thats rich coming from someone who doesnt understand or doesnt want to understand the difference between a solar electrical panel and a solar hot water panel even after it has been explained to them several times
2925780 so ann coulter speaks for entire the right wing movement
2925781 want more proof read hannitys last book for additional proof read
2925782 right wingers said cigerette sic smoking not harmful can you show me one right winger who has said that
2925783 there is no conclusive proof that nicotines addictive and the same thing with cigarettes causing emphysema lung cancer heart disease
2925784 wasnt that the same year aglore said he invented the internet
2925785 its 13 yrs old a rw radio talk show host
2925786 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
2925787 funny that i always thought vinton cerf created the internet
2925788 vinton cerf often called the father of the internet has claimed that the internet would not be where it was without gores leadership on the issue
2925789 i think it is very fair to say that the internet would not be where it is in the united states without the strong support given to it and related research areas by gore
2925790 katie hafner author of a book on the internets origins penned a short piece in the new york times quoting experts who said that gore
2925791 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
2925792 a great deal of science practical science is done outside of universities r amp d departments of firms etc the politcal leanings of these people is unknown but my guess is that it would be about 50 50
2925793 the best american science and nature writing 2006 the best american series paperback
2925794 now why would i go reading mooneys book on anything to do with science
2925795 i think people need to understand that there are unhelpful coalitions on both sides of the politrical fence that both major parties have to speak to
2925796 we have found a climate change cycle which correlates with a cosmic ray flux cycle with a periodicity of 14 million years therefore the anthropogenic component of global warming for the past couple of decades may be less than commonly accepted
2925797 thats why its best to ignore the pundits on both sides and go direct to the science
2925798 can you show me one right winger who has said that
2925799 lets be fair those on the political left have undoubtedly abused science
2925800 humans were relatively unharmed by ddt even with the massive amounts applied in the 50s and 60s
2925801 in objecting to genetically modified foods for instance greenpeace has suggested
2925802 have you even bothered to read mooney he gives his justification for focusing on the gop very early on so either you havent or you ignored that part
2925803 any chance of putting that swill in plain english to understand your incoherent rant
2925804 in other words its easier to beat up on the administration as it will sell more books than it is to deal with the truth
2925805 the history of gm crops is a good example science helping us to increase acreage output along with the accruing environmental benefits
2925806 im afraid that i dont buy your theory that there is a conspiracy by scientists to obscure a link between abortion and breast cancer
2925807 im more inclined to believe the studies that mooney cites which indicate that the link doesnt exist and that the people saying that there is such a link do so because they are against abortion for religious reasons
2925808 concluded that having an abortion or miscarriage does not increase a womans subsequent risk of developing breast cancer newer studies examined large numbers of women collected data before breast cancer was found and gathered medical history information from medical records rather than simply from self reports thereby generating more reliable findings the newer studies consistently showed no association between induced and spontaneous abortions and breast cancer risk
2925809 are you sure you havent got this thread confused with one about iraq
2925810 am i the only person here hoping that jc does not look both ways before crossing the street
2925811 you know how you guys are always linking haliburten exxon mobil ge gm ford and every other fotune 500 company to denialists of science
2925812 last time i checked greenpeace is not congress hell i dont think greenpeace has ever held much weight in dc no matter who has been running the show
2925813 you know how you guys are always linking haliburten exxon mobil ge gm ford and every other fotune 500 company to denialists of science
2925814 american doctors on the other hand prescribed all sorts of antiinfectives the disease was clearly some sort of invasion of our sacred bodily borders by sneaky foreign organisms which must be destroyed with a scorched policy if need be

2925817 di jakarta aku nggak akan macam macem nggak akan bandel
2925818 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
2925819 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
2925820 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2925821 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2925822 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2925823 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2925824 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2925825 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2925826 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2925827 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2925828 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2925829 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2925830 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2925831 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2925832 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2925833 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2925834 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2925835 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2925836 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2925837 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2925838 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2925839 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2925840 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2925841 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2925842 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2925843 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2925844 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2925845 men looked at the female face much more than women and both looked at the genitals comparably
2925846 this is stuff you see other people do and you think thatd be awesome
2925847 i was an extra in the surrogates with bruce willis
2925848 i was in the background in a beauty shop scene
2925849 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
2925850 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
2925851 the wall street journal gets a gigantic miss for taking at face value the recent actions of moqtada al sadr rather than a surrender i think his recent actions are the start of hezbollah south with strong support from iran the real nature of transformation will become apparent once the united states troops are withdrawn
2925852 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2925853 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2925854 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2925855 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2925856 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2925857 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2925858 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2925859 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2925860 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2925861 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2925862 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2925863 you dont need any proof you just see it its in here everyday
2925864 you can see the rivers turning color and dead fish
2925865 i see where i live i live in costa rica at the moment and its very beautiful and clean
2925866 i see the difference about how the us is treating all its resources
2925867 i ride a bike i dont drive a car little things but i still us too much
2925868 its the price of gas i think that has made people think a little bit more about improving their lifestyle and giving back to the earth
2925869 my goal is to show people how to cook local produce
2925870 it doesnt have to be transported all the way across the country or across the globe
2925871 you dont have to attack the united states to put us on our back you just cut 30 percent of the oil
2925872 global warming is on page two for me page one is foreign oil
2925873 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
2925874 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
2925875 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
2925876 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
2925877 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
2925878 this is a truly great leader a truly great man a truly inspiring man
2925879 ralph nader is not a protest candidate he is not for sale and neither is my vote
2925880 i am not voting for a third party or a third person nor is my vote a protest vote and obama has the support of democrats not necessarily liberals liberals like myself are backing ralph nader
2925881 third or fourth party presidential candidates could garner enough votes in november to make a difference in some of the hotly contested swing states
2925882 i cant vote for anybody who doesnt call for an immediate end to the war in iraq
2925883 the war under post nuremburg laws is a criminal war of aggression its illegal we have no right as a nation to debate the terms of the occupation we have no right to be there
2925884 a few things we wont tolerate personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
2925885 personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
2925886 campaigns and parties often use dirty tricks to suppress the vote
2925887 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
2925888 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
2925889 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
2925890 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2925891 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
2925892 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
2925893 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
2925894 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2925895 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2925896 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2925897 speak softly and carry a big stick and you will go far
2925898 he had a strong belief that judges should not be in the public eye
2925899 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2925900 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2925901 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2925902 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2925903 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2925904 just so you all know we did set a record
2925905 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2925906 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2925907 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2925908 i want energy to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2925909 ive been going there as an individual businessman for 40 years to washington
2925910 the richer i got the more polite they were did i get anything done hell no
2925911 i want to get to a million people by the time congress comes back in after recess
2925912 if they see with me a million people that are gonna write to them say something to them put pressure on them theyre going to listen to us i can promise you that
2925913 i dont have any profit motive in this im doing it for america
2925914 it will be similar to the eisenhower interstate highway period in the 1950s
2925915 he said it was an emergency i want it to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2925916 and weve had a pretty good drop in the oil price
2925917 he believes in global warming i do too but global warming is on page 2 for me on page 1 its the 700 million going out the back door from our dependency on 70 percent of imported oil
2925918 and its also driving the key challenge for us which is energy independence
2925919 ive been working on this since i was elected in 1996 so i get excited whenever anybody else joins this effort
2925920 hes saying if you are not going to listen because im wealthy im going to shame you into listening to people its a great approach
2925921 he wasnt successful but he made a lot of money at it
2925922 eliminates peoples jobs and then asks the taxpayers to fund his new venture
2925923 american people are desperate for answers and if they get robbed in the process
2925924 some places were unprepared some places just couldnt handle it
2925925 people know its going to be a historically high turnout whether they can do anything about it is another question
2925926 tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of voters are disenfranchised sometimes raising serious questions about whether the intended choice of the voters was certified as the winner
2925927 the first couple of primaries get all the attention its decided and nobody turns out for other elections later on in the primary season
2925928 and that didnt happen this time and i think thats where some elections administrators in later primaries got caught
2925929 some might get lost or replaced or the person didnt fill out all the information and theyre not on the rolls
2925930 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2925931 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2925932 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2925933 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2925934 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2925935 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2925936 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2925937 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2925938 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2925939 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2925940 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2925941 is designed to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind
2925942 loony liberalism a kind of ideological m nage a trois between timothy leary karl marx and al gore
2925943 matriarchal environmentalist multicultural anti male anti family anti individual and public hygiene shibboleths are enforced by orwellian regulatory agencies commissions and tribunals better known as the smoke smut seat belt thought language and calorie police
2925944 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
2925945 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2925946 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2925947 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2925948 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2925949 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2925950 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2925951 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2925952 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2925953 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2925954 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2925955 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2925956 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2925957 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2925958 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2925959 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2925960 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2925961 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2925962 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2925963 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2925964 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2925965 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2925966 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2925967 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2925968 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
2925969 thats second nature to me whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
2925970 is different than anything ive ever done that kind of has a pop quality to it
2925971 when i was a kid growing up in the southwest i worked for a rodeo company
2925972 so we wanted to do the comedy to tip our hats to the old burt reynolds movies and we wanted our characters to be strong and have the toast be a thread that runs through the movie
2925973 i was really concerned about hollywood meets ted nugent with their extreme difference in philosophies
2925974 teds a good friend of mine and teds not a hater yeah hes got a strong agenda and he carries a gun but hes never pulled it on anyone he can be dangerous if you try to tread on him but he doesnt bring the hate to the table hes so fun he kept everybody in stitches
2925975 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
2925976 al gore heard me say that and said were going to get some people on opposite ends of confrontation like rosie and donald trump and put em on the tv
2925977 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
2925978 you realize that you know what 50 million spins as a writer compares to lennon the bee gees and billy joel
2925979 ive got a 35 greatest hits album in the store right now
2925980 you can imagine how much it meant to people who needed that song whether people hated it or loved it it left its mark
2925981 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
2925982 most people who talk about courtesy of the red white and blue never even heard the song
2925983 if you read it word for word you know what it means lets go out and get the people responsible for 9 11 they attacked new york they attacked the pentagon they came and killed a bunch of innocent americans
2925984 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war
2925985 my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
2925986 his presidency will be better judged 40 years from now
2925987 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say
2925988 if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
2925989 i think obama stands the best chance for the democratic party since clinton mccain is a good solid choice a smarter version of what we have we probably need a change and the economy needs a change and come election day ill have my mind made up
2925990 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
2925991 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2925992 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2925993 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2925994 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2925995 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2925996 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2925997 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2925998 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2925999 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2926000 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2926001 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2926002 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2926003 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2926004 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2926005 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2926006 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2926007 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2926008 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2926009 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2926010 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2926011 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2926012 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2926013 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2926014 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2926015 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2926016 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
2926017 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
2926018 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
2926019 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
2926020 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
2926021 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2926022 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2926023 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2926024 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2926025 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2926026 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2926027 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2926028 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2926029 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2926030 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2926031 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2926032 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2926033 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2926034 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2926035 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2926036 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2926037 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2926038 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2926039 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2926040 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2926041 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2926042 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2926043 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2926044 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2926045 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2926046 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2926047 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2926048 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2926049 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2926050 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2926051 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2926052 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2926053 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
2926054 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
2926055 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2926056 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2926057 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2926058 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2926059 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2926060 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2926061 doesnt look like all those presidents on the dollar bills
2926062 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
2926063 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
2926064 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2926065 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2926066 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2926067 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2926068 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2926069 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2926070 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2926071 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2926072 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2926073 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2926074 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2926075 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2926076 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
2926077 as far as i know we dont publish response and refusal rates we conducted the poll for the associated press youd have to ask them about releasing the response and refusal rates
2926078 we dont have them here from ipsos it takes a little while for them to get those to us i can ask them it shouldnt take too long but normally it takes a few days theyre not secret or anything
2926079 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
2926080 as soon as lezak came off that last wall i started going crazy were a team we went in as a team and now were exiting as a team and were going out with that gold that we needed to get back
2926081 ive been on the last two relays where we come up short
2926082 to be honest with you i got really tired of losing
2926083 barack obama is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate
2926084 it was an opportunity to go over to china and do something that has probably not been done in the past go to china and do some comedy
2926085 there were days when we got promising news and days when we got not so encouraging news
2926086 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
2926087 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
2926088 there were moments where you were just being watched very closely
2926089 we still did what we wanted to do but i was hurrying it up saying come on come on lets go it was a subconscious thing
2926090 jon always has a very good sense of whats in good taste and bad
2926091 and well try to stay within the bounds of what we think is good taste we didnt go in there to make fun of the chinese people at all
2926092 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2926093 its not a great relationship and its probably not going to become one
2926094 its personal with him in terms of his own legacy and the race stuff really left a bad taste in his mouth
2926095 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2926096 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2926097 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2926098 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2926099 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2926100 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2926101 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2926102 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2926103 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2926104 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2926105 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2926106 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2926107 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2926108 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2926109 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2926110 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2926111 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2926112 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
2926113 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
2926114 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
2926115 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
2926116 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
2926117 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
2926118 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
2926119 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
2926120 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
2926121 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
2926122 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
2926123 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
2926124 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface

2926126 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality

2926130 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
2926131 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
2926132 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general

2926136 i didnt bring it into the courts mr gore brought it into the courts
2926137 richard nixon when he lost to john f kennedy thought that the election had been stolen in chicago which was very likely true with the system at the time
2926138 but he did not even think about bringing a court challenge that was his prerogative so if you dont like the courts getting involved talk to mr gore
2926139 bear in mind that the issue wasnt whether or not the election was going to be decided by a court or not it was whether it was going to be decided by the florida court or by the united states supreme court for a federal election
2926140 i mean one side or the other was going to feel that was a politicized decision but that goes with the territory
2926141 i dont think our legal system should be that complex i think that any system that requires that many of the countrys best minds and they are the best minds is too complex

2926182 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
2926183 that russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2926184 our task is clear we must find the means for an immediate ceasefire accepted by both sides
2926185 we must move quickly this is not a diplomatic exercise its an exercise of survival
2926186 also expressed his concerns about the disproportionate use of force and lack of respect for the territorial integrity of georgia
2926187 the european union is prepared to play a role in stabilising this region on condition that the parties involved in the conflict cool down their emotions and end this escalating conflict
2926188 rather than acting as a neutral peacekeeper russia has escalated the hostilities through its attacks on georgian towns and cities outside the conflict zone
2926189 we agreed that japan and the united states will cooperate in trying to stop the violence and to secure the territorial integrity of georgia
2926190 it is time now to make an assessment about whether they have worked but as far as im concerned the jury is in they have worked they should be extended
2926191 there are times when the valley and cbd streets have people straying all over them like browns cows and there needs to be a certain amount of channelling people so they cross at appropriate points
2926192 it is too early to tell but the fact that no pedestrian has been seriously injured or killed in recent times since the barriers have been in place represents a positive start

2926205 all manufacturing is facing a critical challenge as we know
2926206 but what may surprise people is how workers in advanced technology are being affected as china diversifies its export base and its already expanding its electronic products aircraft auto parts and machinery more american products will be unfairly disadvantaged
2926207 chinas manipulation of its currency makes the yuan artificially cheap effectively subsidizing exports
2926208 we can strengthen jobs and manufacturing in america but only if we first take steps to stop chinas cheating
2926209 we will eventually go back to the mind set of a society where you have to have 3 percent up front to buy a home
2926210 it does create some challenges for some of our buyers
2926211 how that specifically will impact our operations i dont know
2926212 knowing that millions of americans will awaken to a law that leaves them with zero alternatives for attaining homeownership
2926213 i am special so are my kids my pets and now my home or in many cases my homes
2926214 people spend a lot of time and concern in creating their home
2926215 they put their personality into their home its a facet of who they are im telling their story
2926216 it was defintitely a goal that i wanted to achieve
2926217 but not only did i want to achieve it but i wanted to keep it and prove that i deserved it
2926218 i thought jonathan goodwin had a good game the other night
2926219 he was a guy that graded out well when offensive coordinator doug marrone went through the grades offensively
2926220 jeff was one of my better friends on the team and he was a good guy for the team
2926221 its tough replacing him and at the same time it isnt for the most part if i got out there and do what the coaches want thats all i can do
2926222 but as long as i go out and get the job done and coach payton and coach doug marrone are happy then ill be fine
2926223 im glad those things happened but im not going to take credit for that
2926224 it helped a lot and gave the coaches a lot more confidence in me
2926225 i looked at it as a shot to prove myself and a shot for the coaches to not have to worry with me being in there i went in those games planning to play my hardest
2926226 going into last season jeff missed some time in preseason and i got to get a lot of reps with those guys
2926227 when i stepped in during the season i had played with those guys for a little bit of time

2926232 students are urged to have a career or academic endorsement
2926233 its really about doing some serious thinking and soul searching
2926234 theyve got to be constantly reflecting on whats best for them
2926235 one consequence may be ineligibility to enter a state university
2926236 theres the ability to expand the ability to be successful in both venues
2926237 well be trying to give them support and recommendations but students need to think whats best for me theyre not trapped into a schedule
2926238 that type of instruction was thought to be only applicable to gifted and talented students
2926239 we as teachers have to be competent and prepared and able to facilitate conversation were guiding the learning the kids are begging for this they want to see the relevance of what they are learning
2926240 the more we expect from students the more they seem to produce were hoping as the bar is raised particularly in math which we see as a gateway course to college students will meet that challenge the chance of success in a college classroom increases and the chances of campuses retaining students are increased

2926242 i think its a reflection on the upcoming excitement for the season
2926243 people who have seen the scrimmages and the workouts are excited about the potential for this year
2926244 it goes all the way back to the signing party in the indoor facility that was the first time people had ever seen that now they know we redid the weight room and now they can see this field i think they can sense the changes coming
2926245 this is like a new beginning theres a lot of new enthusiasm the field is going to save money its beautiful
2926246 this year weve really made a conscious effort to be positive about everything
2926247 guys are really embracing that attitude theyre coming out every day ready to get better and ready to work hard i think its noticeable
2926248 my mom came to practice the other day and even noticed it
2926249 but i always tell my guys to sacrifice every day i have to lead by example

2926253 we would sew this oversized label onto your sweater making your shirt part of our line
2926254 people do not buy objects they buy ideas about products
2926255 the name is therefore in the object not as a label attached to it but as an invisible quality of the object
2926256 in the absence of any obvious overt connection between the word and the thing the tendency is to assume that there must be some deeper hidden connection

2926294 as a cancer survivor i understand the importance of a diet that avoids animal flesh
2926295 in order to create fatty livers foie gras producers subject ducks and geese to an invasive feeding technique that forces into their stomachs up to thirty percent of their body weight every day thats like a two hundred pound man being forced to swallow sixty pounds of food a day
2926296 vegans have a much healthier body mass index than most meat eaters and they live years longer
2926297 twenty years of campaigning against factory farming using legal means such as protesting and lobbying saw little to no changes for animals
2926298 because so many of you voiced your opposition the society of gynecologic oncologists felt enough pressure to cancel that portion of the event

2926300 the russian side did not receive any official proposals from the georgian side to begin a peace process and to stop the bloodshed
2926301 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on us russian relations
2926302 we have introduced our troops into the safety area in the gali district near abkhazia
2926303 the operation aims to restore order in the peacekeeping forces responsibility zone
2926304 if i had a garden in the urban environment i would just assume there is lead in the soil
2926305 to be honest i didnt even think that lead would affect the vegetables
2926306 gas prices food prices are high and people realize that growing your own is better tasting better quality food
2926307 we want people to garden safely and have a harvest to reap the benefits of nutrition social and health from working in the garden
2926308 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2926309 ive said that we could expect between 30 and 40 positive cases
2926310 that is the extrapolation of the figures from athens if we have less we must be extremely glad because that will mean that there has been a de terrent effect
2926311 am i disappointed that there is still doping of course i am i hate doping but we have to be realistic it would be wrong to be utopians doping is to sport what criminality is to society and there will always be criminality in society
2926312 many countries made it abundantly clear that they did not want to send cheats to beijing
2926313 so they have embarked upon a systematic testing regime in the months leading up to departure of their teams for beijing i hope that in two weeks time when we walk away from here weve seen results that have made a significant step in the way back to confidence and integrity in sport
2926314 i definitely understand people questioning people running fast because weve had several track athletes busted for steroids in the past
2926315 i get tested whenever they want to test me if its six vials of blood one week then again the next week thats just the price i have to go through to make sure everything is ok
2926316 the general climate in sports today creates an unfair environment where athletes whether setting world records or competing at an older age are all of a sudden accused of doing it by performance enhancing drugs
2926317 we want to do everything possible to take away that stigma for the clean athletes we want to give athletes a testing platform that we all can have comfort in knowing theyre actually clean thats a dream of ours
2926318 i shouldnt have to go through that mental exercise preparing for what i do if one of our athletes doesnt test clean
2926319 but i have a responsibility to think about these things given the environment we live in doping exists and its going to kill sports as we know it unless we do something about it
2926320 there is an expertise that makes us more effective than we ever were before
2926321 that doesnt mean to say that there arent cheats out there still or that there might always be cheats out there
2926322 may become something that enters the lexicon of doping in the days ahead and we want to be there to pick it up and deal with it at an earlier stage much of what we do is about public health at this point were thinking about the worlds elite athletes but to the point that this or any of those other drugs are taken there is a risk to the health sometimes the lives of those who are doping

2926336 it was the milf which wanted the inclusion of balabac and bataraza in the ancestral domain but there was no consultation done with any sector in palawan even with the municipalities involved or the local political leadership
2926337 we have repeatedly rejected the inclusion of palawan in the moro territories
2926338 they palawan muslim communities are peace loving people and precisely they came here to palawan in order to live peacefully and avoid the conflict in mindanao
2926339 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2926340 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2926341 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2926342 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2926343 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2926344 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2926345 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2926346 first off good job grabe ang tyaga mo gumawa ha naaliw lahat ng taong pinakitaan ko nito

2926350 he told president hu that this is an important aspect of the u s china dialogue and that the chinese can expect that any future american president will also make it an important aspect of our dialogue
2926351 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2926451 if you cant fall in love with the god of the bible you dont need a new depiction you need a new heart
2926452 what i dont get is how someone can be genuinely convicted of their sin to the extent that they see it as god sees it in all its depravity be truly forgiven having the weight of this sin and rebellion removed knowing that now because of christ every thought god has toward us is one of tender mercy and then on top of all this getting to walk in fellowship with god every day being comforted in our sorrows convicted in our sins taught in our ignorance encouraged by his kindness supported in his love how can one of gods children truly experience all this and even dare to ask god to account for himself every moment we live in peace with god and outside of hell is a moment we dont deserve the thought of taking god to task for anything else is beyond me

2926487 take one snapshot of your religious experience and use it to condemn the whole package
2926488 will you denounce reject and repudiate your church because some of its most respected leaders call the catholic church the great whore will you denounce reject and repudiate your church because some of its most visible leaders have blamed natural disasters on gay americans many leaders in your church teach that anyone that does not accept christ in the way they teach will be tortured forever in hell even if that individual never had a chance to hear and respond to the christian message will you denounce reject and repudiate your church and its leaders for taking such a position

2926530 it was a little bit of a concern initially but harry is fine now
2926531 it was a case of a young team mate being a little over enthusiastic and harrys knee was a bit sore afterwards but hes recovering well and is on track to play against steaua bucharest
2926532 he could play on wednesday but if there are any concerns at all then im told hell be rested until the return game a decision hasnt been made yet
2926533 its a case of harry trying to sort out any problems before they even surface
2926534 hes settling in really well at turkey the team has turkish internationals and facilities which have to be seen to believed
2926535 most of his team mates speak english and so does the coach so theres no problems at all in communications
2926536 he basically said that hes a top operator and that he would be good for harry and having les gelis there 24 7 is also massive for harry it gives him a great sense of security
2926537 those are the games that invariably decide the title and the ones the fans care about most
2926538 some of them said if he didnt play 50 percent of games they would terminate the agreement and if he did they would extend the contract by two years
2926539 it was a question of trying to dictate terms and it wasnt realistic

2926545 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2926546 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2926547 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2926548 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2926549 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2926555 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2926556 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2926557 the success of the a league is such that we will have 10 teams next year and possibly 12 the following year lowy told a gathering of officials sponsors coaches players and media personnel
2926558 everything is heading in the right direction the crowds are growing the television audience is growing membership is growing the media coverage as well and the game is reasonably financially sound
2926559 if i put on my optimistic view which i have to do in this job maybe we will end up with 14 teams
2926560 now what we have to do is make sure the clubs also become sound there is a lot more to do
2926561 there is always some risk attached to these sort of expansion programs he said
2926562 but weve analysed the proposals from the two clubs who are looking to come in in season five and we are happy with the business models presented to us we are confident that they will be successful
2926563 thats a view that has come from some quarters but it is something i dont subscribe to buckley said
2926564 the potential of increasing the fund for foreign visa players will help defuse that
2926565 you will find that australian players who are overseas will come back to fill the gaps as will state league players
2926566 we have looked at that and i am sure that the playing standards wont be diminished
2926567 i dont think the ffa can tell clubs where they should get their players from buckley said
2926568 but as more australian clubs participate in the asian champions league they will become exposed to more asian quality players
2926569 club scouts will become more familiar with asia and over time the recruiting focus will be shift from europe or south america to asia
2926570 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2926580 good intentions and laudable goals are small compensation to the families farmers and ranchers who are being hurt by the federal governments efforts to trade food for fuel
2926581 any government mandate that artificially props up a single industry to the detriment of millions of americans is bad public policy
2926582 not only are the 2008 mandates destructive but the scheduled mandate next year will again increase another 16 7 per cent from corn consuming an additional 4 5 per cent or more of the 2009 2010 corn crop than the anticipated 34 per cent of the crop being consumed this year for ethanol production
2926583 we had tons of different names for the album but none seemed to sum up all weve put in to getting it recorded and released
2926584 by any means necessary just sums it up perfectly so we stuck with that
2926585 ever since we finished it off probably even during recording ive always thought what are people going to make of it and the good stuff weve had said has been amazing really
2926586 even if we have had anything negative written its been someone who just doesnt get it like they dont understand bands can still make straight up heavy rock n roll records i can live with criticism if its justified but it does my head in when someone hasnt a clue or are just lazy
2926587 we just do what we do and always have done we did initially get lumped in some daft 80s hair metal revival but we wanted nothing to do at all with that so we ended up becoming even faster and heavier i wouldnt want to be complacent sitting in a stale scene doing what everyone else does
2926588 it probably does more than weve realised because were in a town that isnt really part of anywhere as such we havent been part of a scene so have just done what weve felt like
2926589 i dont think there are many bands we sound like its a real mix of stuff it seems to frustrate people trying to categorise us were too heavy for some but not heavy enough for some
2926590 we have had some reviews where theyve been shocked and stunned were from yorkshire like we should be down the pit earning a crust to buy flat caps and black pudding for our whippets strange
2926591 it could be people getting sick and tired of manufactured rubbish some kind of nostalgia or just that people are getting much more varied tastes
2926592 i did hear someone mention their daughter and all her friends were in to r amp b they then started playing guitar hero and now they walk around with back combed hair wearing m tley cr e t shirts i dunno people are weird
2926593 the only thing happening is big record companies are miffed because with the advent of digital music they dont have such a strangle hold over the industry and cant control it like they used to
2926594 music is now cheaper to produce and distribute so bands dont need them anymore independent labels are the way to go for the future
2926595 i wouldnt say we are part of it anyways and we definitely dont need to justify ourselves to anyone weve always been outsiders and thats the way i like it
2926596 we must prescribe official names to peoples of certain countries
2926597 what about those from sweden should we call them swedenese
2926598 no grasshopper im afraid you do not get the point yet
2926599 mwa ha ha ha ha evil evil laugh now we go and stay in sauna
2926600 we had all been wondering what we were going to do to mark the twenty year milestone in the biohazard history and it seemed like it was long overdue even though we are all busy with many different projects as well as other careers and music projects it has been surprisingly painless to get everyone together we had our first real jam three weeks ago and it was really amazingly tight considering it had been such a long time the longest we had ever gone without playing together our former manager scott suggested to me that i hook up with guitar and we do a reunion he was definitely integral in getting us all together we think that since biohazard sold nearly four million albums worldwide and has performed in virtually every corner of the earth lots of fans will come out to relive the even more famous live show get a t shirt stage dive or just reminisce
2926601 you were shit when i saw you but a ladder did fall on your head
2926602 when i bring people into the room i always tell them to think of this room as a museum
2926603 because if you think of this as a living room it is a little overwhelming
2926604 since i have christmas all year long perhaps christmas isnt quite as special on just that single day as it might be for other people
2926605 but i like it that way its not that it is worse or boring i just get to enjoy it more
2926606 some of them are really heart wrenching because they are asking for a job for mommy or a job for daddy
2926607 my elves are all scurrying around helping me find special gifts for all our friends
2926608 the letters they send are general and dont promise anything
2926609 but it lets them know that santa is thinking about them and that theyll see him at christmas
2926610 santa claus lives forever in the hearts and minds of people
2926611 because santa claus is love and giving and all those wonderful things

2926616 one of the big misconceptions about bungy is that you have to be aged between 18 and 30 and have a chip missing from your head
2926617 but its not true we get everyone from kids aged 10 to our favourite senior who is a local man of 74

2926619 travellers have been sharing their holiday photos with us since lonely planet began but weve never really been able to show our appreciation until now this is the competition of a lifetime for anyone who has dreamed of being a professional travel photographer the campaign gives them the opportunity to team up with lonely planet and get them showcased on the front of our guidebooks
2926620 their approach was unique the site comprises a 30m wide body of water with 20 odd metres either side of bank so it is divided
2926621 everybody came up with a linear arrangement but agence ter overcame that by blurring the separation between the banks and the canal
2926622 we decided to consider the area as a whole by putting floating gardens into the water and putting water into the banks
2926623 when you walk along the liffey you are never close to the water which is understandable because of the tide and the boats but the canal is a very quiet place so the idea is to have floating gardens very low in the water
2926624 oh commemorate me where there is water canal water preferably just a canal bank seat for the passer by
2926625 but just to bring a new layer we need to keep an identity so the trees except in one pontoon in the next phase will be native species such as oak and white willow while the flower beds will be mostly planted with exotic plants many of which you already find in ireland it will be very colourful and we are working on year round blooming
2926626 we want to avoid all those masts poles which you see everywhere in public spaces

2926636 i would be absolutely delighted if berbatov was still at the club after the end of the transfer window i really hope that is the case
2926637 he is a magnificent player and we want to enjoy another season of him at this club
2926638 the window closes on august 31 so anything can happen before then
2926639 we like to operate with four strikers and we havent been able to do that
2926640 i cant answer the question because i dont have the right answer
2926641 after the olympic games the fight for human rights must go on
2926642 what we shall do here is to declare a failure of elections well see if votes will affect final results of elections if it will affect the results well call special elections if not therell be no elections there anymore
2926643 as of now members of the marines and the pnp are trying to establish the identity of armed groups
2926644 they were outnumbered they were forced to give in the ballot boxes were snatched
2926645 the current situation on the ground is very fluid and very volatile
2926646 that line like a tree planted by the water i shall not be moved
2926647 it seemed to sum up what everyone struggling to come back after katrina was feeling i really wanted to bring the city together with that thought
2926648 folk tradition of adapting and transforming songs to serve as anthems to galvanize people in a cause
2926649 everything has changed since katrina even our neighborhoods arent familiar anymore
2926650 youre talking about kids who lost everything their homes their schools and friends
2926651 for some of these kids this music is all they really feel they have and they are very excited about this project
2926652 look at me whoever youre scared of theyre not your problem anymore
2926653 theyve gone so far out of their way to have batman taken seriously that all of the fun has been sucked out of it with

2926658 she gives us the expertise on what is current and what frankly is funny about kids and their parents and jay falzone nancys writing partner and i write it it is wonderful to have a collaboration with someone you have known all your life
2926659 its my potty and ill try if i want to
2926660 we think that our audience is mostly parents and grandparents so we choose songs from that era when they were young
2926661 part of the fun is thinking about the original song and relating to it with those new lyrics
2926662 each place seems to like different aspects of the show
2926663 im sure something will be big in philadelphia something will strike a chord
2926664 im still not a grandmother so i am still going through all this parenting stuff
2926665 i never know when i will retool a song there could be a parenting crisis at any moment
2926666 publicly and unequivocally deny the whole thing and sue the
2926667 make a youtube video in which he kneels before elizabeth and she beats the sanctimonious ken doll stuffing out of him
2926668 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future
2926669 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2926670 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2926671 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2926672 i know that its not possible that this child could be mine because of the timing of events
2926673 ive never paid a dime of money to any of the people that are involved
2926674 ive never asked anybody to pay a dime of money never been told that any moneys been paid nothing has been done at my request so if the allegation is that somehow i participated in the payment of money that is a lie an absolute lie which is typical of these types of publications
2926675 published in a supermarket tabloid that is absolutely not true
2926676 i cannot make any sense out of that when i went to this meeting youve already asked me about uh i was not wearing a t shirt i was wearing a long sleeved shirt with the sleeves rolled up i dont know who that picture i dont know if that picture is me it could well be it looks like me i dont know who that baby is i have no idea what that picture is
2926677 i dont know if the picture has been altered manufactured if its a picture of me taken some other time holding another baby i have no idea
2926678 i was not at this meeting holding a child for my photograph to be taken i can tell you that
2926679 you know love dont mean nothing really im not a fan of love people fall in and out of love every day let the lights go off and see how much they love you dont let anything be on that table at 5 oclock in the evening and see how much she loves you let that car keep breaking down and see how much she loves you i really believe out of 27 years of being with my wife that we went through that transition that we like each other and i think thats the most important thing i truly like her shes my friend you know and i wouldnt trade her for nothing in the world
2926680 in acquiring elite we add further capacity and capability to the group from a long established company with a reputation for first class quality and service
2926681 we played with ryan dinwiddie at quarterback and got the spark we were looking for from him and hoped to be able to get it for another game
2926682 when it became evident that it wasnt happening i just felt it was time to go back to who i believe to be our no 1 quarterback nobody knocked out the champion
2926683 when he was on his game at the beginning of last year for the first half of the season it was almost to the point where he was uncanny with his accuracy
2926684 nothing has changed with his reads or anything like that or his release
2926685 if im saying to kevin if i want you to improve on any one thing its just to be a little more accurate with your throws if he does i think hell back there with the elite quarterbacks again
2926686 its not about what you do differently its about what you go out every week and practice to do and take it over to the game
2926687 this is an opportunity to go back and help the team get a win
2926688 we just need to come together as a team and put something together and try to get a win i know its like a broken record and we keep saying the same thing every week but were in that position right now where were going to sound like a broken record until we get a win
2926689 now the entire team knows that he indeed can win a game for us as our quarterback
2926690 sometimes its a disadvantage for a quarterback to do that kind of stuff instead of worrying about just the game youre worrying about what to call and if this is the right play and satisfying everybody by giving them the ball it will probably be my first time from beginning to end that ill have done it so well see what happens thursday night
2926691 my impression is that all of these different agencies are treating this like a hot potato trying to pass it to the next agency and saying that they themselves are blameless
2926692 with hindsight there are probably many things that could or should have been done to avoid this crisis
2926693 its different than birkdale where the british open was played but i know i love the idea of the back nine in a major on a sunday
2926694 i love it so much that im actually disappointed im seven months away from the next major i actually struggle when things are comfortable
2926695 it was very evident that when i won i was so focused on what i was doing i turned around saw sergio and could see the sheer disappointment
2926696 it wasnt the same as carnoustie i think maybe it got away from him at 16
2926697 thursday an opening 71 my game was going downhill quickly and i couldnt get to clubhouse fast enough
2926698 i felt like i played my best but i came up a little short
2926699 its just a matter of time ive said it before there are guys that get a little bit fortunate they get in contention and manage to get things going their way
2926700 dont make great stuff in a nice sweater and drinking a martini

2926702 we hope that while these students are getting their undergrad degree balanceboost can offer them another
2926703 we might not always get it right but at least were making an effort and hey isnt learning what college is all about

2926707 theres one or two hedge funds that i look at that i would imagine at certain points of the month were down 10 to 15 percent and one of them which is a good one was down 7 percent in a month which is the worst month theyve ever had
2926708 the average woman would rather have beauty than brains because the average man can see better than he can think
2926709 everyone hears what you say friends listen to what you say best friends listen to what you dont say
2926710 we are both so happy to have two british girls on the podium we just tried to ignore the times and race the final
2926711 i dont think either of us are natural sprinters we dont do the 100m free so we are naturally suited to the back half of the race
2926712 we didnt panic when we were a little bit behind i didnt see anyone past katie i didnt know what was going on
2926713 i couldnt see what there was on the other side of the pool i saw katie and just tried to catch her
2926714 i dont think either of us expected it and especially a gold and a bronze its absolutely amazing
2926715 it hasnt sunk in yet im just over the moon
2926716 people always step up and do things out of the ordinary at the olympics
2926717 i had more adrenaline going than i ever had in my life
2926718 all of us knew what were capable of but to actually do it to get that tradition back its a phenomenal feeling still right now im in disbelief
2926719 i was just pounding on the blocks saying the f word saying come on
2926720 you know as soon as he came off that last wall i just started going crazy
2926721 when i flipped at the 50 and i still saw how far ahead he was and he was the world record holder til about two minutes before that when sullivan led off with the world record i thought it really crossed my mind for a split second theres no way
2926722 then i changed i said you know what thats ridiculous this is the olympics im here for these guys im here for the united states of america its more than i dont care how bad it hurts or whatever im just going to go out there and hit it
2926723 honestly in like 5 seconds i was thinking all these things you know just got like a super charge and took it from there it was unreal
2926724 feds boost immigrant funding by 10m mackay hands out 10 million for language skills training
2926725 if they wanted to get it done it probably would have been done a long time ago were three or four weeks into the season so im just looking to being healthy and being 100 percent for the first game
2926726 plaxico burress has to take care of plaxico burress so thats what i want to do make all the right judgments as far as my health and as far as my ankle before i go back out on that football field
2926727 ive stressed that to them when i can get out there im going to be running 100 miles per hour with no restrictions
2926728 those numbers i put up last year i did it limping around
2926729 i want to get to be healthy so i can go out and just dominate and rip it up i want that for myself and i want that for my team
2926730 i guess it eases my mind but you still need time to practice and work on things and improve on things
2926731 last year we had a good connection but it wasnt a great connection at all times thats what practice is all about and training camp hopefully he gets healthy and we can get back to work
2926732 hes on schedule to return the day that hes eligible to come back
2926733 this is a part of that process throw a couple days touch and feel and then go out and pitch a couple times in brooklyn and then be ready unless he has a setback during this time
2926734 come wednesday weve got some decisions weve got to make and we just dont know what they are yet
2926735 there are always sticking points in any dialogue but we are confident we will overcome
2926736 yeah you know those camera phones make it tough to do anything these days doesnt it
2926737 i told eric on day one that unless i pass out i am going to try and do everything that everyone else does
2926738 im no different aside from being a little gray headed and a little bit older
2926739 it was kind of funny to see him over there running a lap
2926740 i think it was a penalty lap but the fans turned it into a victory lap
2926741 it looked like a game out there the way he just pumped it and threw it right in the hole before the safety could get over there that was a heck of a throw a heck of a throw
2926742 he pumped and threw a 60 yard bomb on a rope between two defenders
2926743 thats something a lot of quarterbacks cant do in this league not just anybody else that was on this team before a lot of quarterbacks in this league cant do that
2926744 he gave me the opportunity to make a play and he put it out there far enough he put enough air up under it where i could run and go get it
2926745 he kind of held the safety up so the safety wouldnt get over there and zipped it in there
2926746 there were a couple of mistakes in terms of the ballhandling where he went one way the back went the other way
2926747 were 25 plays into it so theres going to be some of that
2926748 hell embarrass you if you are not on top of your game
2926749 it allows me to be more comfortable and more confident in what youre doing
2926750 when you make plays especially as a young guy you just get more confidence
2926751 i thought the play in the cleveland game was really a good look at what we saw in college where he got into the end zone
2926752 he knows when a receiver enters the end zone now you dont want to be even with the receiver you want to slide underneath him because you have the sideline and you have the back of the end zone as your help and that was a lot of the stuff that we saw in college the instincts
2926753 but well do everything we can to try to keep him fresh we might give him an extra day here or there well try to find a spot to do that
2926754 if youre going to get into the playoffs were probably going to get a little further than that
2926755 but if we can stay in that 180 190 range well be very happy
2926756 i feel like im in good shape in between starts i work hard i feel good its a matter of going out there and performing i didnt do that today
2926757 he says hes feeling fine the balls coming out of his hand decently the sink isnt there as consistent as it was but i think a little extra rest will put that back
2926758 if mike pelfrey has hit a wall then the mets are in trouble
2926759 to get him for me was like milwaukee getting cc sabathia
2926760 its good whenever guys on the team want to go to you for the win
2926761 this guys been stopping for us since hes been healthy coming back and hes pitching big games already for us in the short time hes been here every time hes come out and taken the mound he hasnt disappointed
2926762 if you dont want the ball there youre not a competitor
2926763 i dont blame him at all if i had to do it again id do it again
2926764 especially coming back from the injury hes come back from to jump back into the middle of a pennant race and do what hes done
2926765 i was hoping wed get a little rain take johnson out play a little bit get to the bullpen early didnt work out that way thats what the weatherman said didnt work out that way
2926766 its unrealistic to go out there and think youre going to rattle off 10 12 in a row like we did before the break
2926767 we take it one game at a time one series at a time and if we can take two out of three from here on out well be sitting pretty at the end of september
2926768 the last three starts ive struggled against them you cant dispute that ive struggled against them but hopefully that isnt going to continue to happen
2926769 its real hard to hit when youre down six runs early in the game
2926770 but joe girardi wants me back in september he wants me to be part of the reason why were in that pennant race that would be nice
2926771 we have a chance to get him right over time
2926772 he clearly based on this year needs more time to develop
2926773 i feel like ive gotten a lot better at dealing with failure this year
2926774 this is the first time ive really had to deal with failure and ive been trying to learn to move on and not get stuck on the failure i had to move on and thats what i was trying to do
2926775 sometimes handling the press that takes a unique skill set i know what he said and how he felt are two different things hes a competitor
2926776 our inability to get a runner in from third with less than two outs killed us today
2926777 we have not been good and we have to do better
2926778 i stole the base bill just it up weve come up with so many opportunities where we didnt get the extra hit thats part of my thinking there be aggressive and make something happen
2926779 we dug ourselves a hole here its getting to the point where we gotta win games
2926780 it just seems like when these guys get something going they get the job done
2926781 maybe they can grab some roles that open up in hollywood
2926782 that was not something that we wanted them to do
2926783 in no way did i think that was going to win the game i didnt think it was going to get through the infield
2926784 for sure i thought one of them would get to it i mean two outs get the next guy
2926785 thats their team man thats their problem we were wondering that too im glad thats not my team if it was wed probably be in here arguing right now
2926786 in my opinion there are already elements of some of kind of genocide of the ossetian people
2926787 what they are doing is nothing to do with conflict it is about annihilation of a democracy of their borders
2926788 if they wanted to get it done it probably would have been done a long time ago were three or four weeks into the season so im just looking to being healthy and being 100 percent for the first game
2926789 plaxico burress has to take care of plaxico burress so thats what i want to do make all the right judgments as far as my health and as far as my ankle before i go back out on that football field
2926790 ive stressed that to them when i can get out there im going to be running 100 miles per hour with no restrictions
2926791 those numbers i put up last year i did it limping around
2926792 i want to get to be healthy so i can go out and just dominate and rip it up i want that for myself and i want that for my team
2926793 i guess it eases my mind but you still need time to practice and work on things and improve on things
2926794 last year we had a good connection but it wasnt a great connection at all times thats what practice is all about and training camp hopefully he gets healthy and we can get back to work
2926795 goods identified with cheap logos become the brunt of regular name calling and bullying the geek is isolated
2926796 a lot of advertising companies blatantly target children without any consideration for the parents of those children
2926797 it is incredibly sad to hear how many youngsters are bullied or isolated for not having the same clothes or accessories as their classmates
2926798 advertising and marketing have made our society increasingly image conscious and our children are suffering the consequences
2926799 schools and colleges should be places where all children feel equal but it is virtually impossible for schools to protect their pupils from the harsher aspects of these commercial influences
2926800 we are worried these pressures will further intensify as schools and colleges look for more help from commercial sponsors to provide it sports and science equipment teaching materials and food

2926824 at the moment many leukaemias are treated with chemotherapy that destroys the diseased blood cells and bone marrow as well as normal cells
2926825 we hope that this discovery will lead to targeted therapies more specific to the malfunctioning cells seen in diseases such as leukaemia
2926826 i think thats a real positive of this work it could target those diseases that are just untreatable at the moment or very difficult to treat

2926828 your idea would be unfair to our buyers think of another way to save money
2926829 at first i thought six would be good but this will enable others to step up and they will so it provides more opportunities for more players and thats a good thing
2926830 everyone should be available for the opening round although im still not sure when that will be
2926831 theres a young matildas camp in august followed by a matildas camp in september then the matildas play in the asean cup in october were not sure where that is yet
2926832 with one a days i think you have more meeting time
2926833 you have more coach planning time you give players a chance to recover and then you can get more quality work thats what coach leach has always been about is getting quality work at the same time when the first game comes around we want to be the freshest team on the field
2926834 i wouldnt say that its the experience of the team
2926835 its just we like the idea of going into our first game with those guys fresh if you can get out here and get your work done and be productive in a shorter amount of time it gives them a chance to get a little longer rest time
2926836 during meetings i try to help the other guys and theres a lot of coaching going on
2926837 its always something new youre always trying to learn a new coverage you always want to pay attention because you never know when theyre going to change something up or add something in
2926838 you may want to focus on coverage adjustments i have chosen to work on blitz rehearsal until we get it down
2926839 its giving us a chance to work at a faster tempo when you have two practices sometimes guys come out in that second practice not focused or tired from the first practice leach wants to work fast work hard be able to focus every practice and get high quality reps you save the legs too
2926840 are going to be beat up a little run down by the time the season starts
2926841 today we see the continuation of what we saw on friday
2926842 there are two factors at play the strengthening of the dollar and the military conflict
2926843 hostilities continue and that is something that worries us a great deal
2926844 as long as we do not move closer to any resolution of this as long as russian forces continue to raid or bomb inside of georgia i think the pressure on russian markets will continue
2926845 de opstandelingen konden naar een naburig dorp vluchten via verschillende gebouwen die als obstakels werden gebruikt tegen de coalitietroepen in het dorp hielden ze 11 burgers gegijzeld onder wie ook enkele kinderen
2926846 de coalitietroepen hebben ondersteuning gevraagd vanuit de lucht tegen de rebellen die zich in gebouwen hadden teruggetrokken ze wisten niet dat er burgers uit het dorp werden vastgehouden
2926847 toen de gevechten afgelopen waren hebben de afghaanse veiligheidstroepen en de coalitie de gebouwen doorzocht en er drie overlevende burgers aangetroffen zij vertelden dat acht burgers omkwamen bij het bombardement
2926848 er is geen hoop meer om de vermisten nog levend van onder de modder te halen
2926849 in ons reiscontract staat dat we in principe maandag om 15 30 uur plaatselijke tijd terug naar belgi vertrekken toen we gisterenavond op onze hotelkamer kwamen lag er een briefje met de melding dat we zondagnacht om 3 30 uur al moesten vertrekken bij aankomst op de luchthaven bleek dat er iets mis was met het vliegtuig en dat we dus niet konden vertrekken ook de vlucht van 15 30 uur is afgelast
2926850 we kunnen hier in turkije niemand van corendon bereiken en ook de opvang op de luchthaven is ondermaats na veel aandringen kregen we een kop koffie en een broodje we weten absoluut niet hoelang we hier nog gaan moeten blijven

2926854 its good to get out here and get a game under your belt
2926855 we didnt play our a plus game today we played pretty good but we have a lot of room to improve

2926865 although since then weeks have become months while pressure from groups opposing phorm continues to mount however according to adam liversage bts chief press officer the trial has not been abandoned
2926866 we are still planning to trial the technology but have not started doing so yet we are currently working on some things before we can begin but are expecting the trials to commence soon
2926867 there are other things we are working through its a separate issue
2926868 as you know in fashion youre either in or youre out
2926869 always spoke to the people and was at home in anybodys company
2926870 we are here today to celebrate the life of a great man a man who had great affection and appreciation for his adopted area
2926871 off screen he remained a family man he valued the privacy that he had found in tourmakeady he had a deep affection for the landscape and the people of mayo and would be absolutely delighted that he is being commemorated locally
2926872 i was doing my exercises and jumping around the place and trying to wake everybody
2926873 i hit a good tee shot and good second shot which i thought was going to give me a good birdie chance at 18 and i messed up the bunker shot
2926874 i had a slow start to the second par of my round but the four birdies in the middle got it going and it was nice to hole some putts in that run and get some feeling on the greens
2926875 titus 3 5 says that such acts of righteousness do not save us
2926876 not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost
2926877 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast
2926878 he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him
2926879 verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life
2926880 then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
2926881 or pointing toward the remission of your sins the remission of your sins
2926882 he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned
2926883 that makes it clear that the matter which settles it is believing just the same as is taught in john 3 18
2926884 he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god
2926885 no they are not the same and are nowhere spoken of as the same in the bible nor is it ever stated in the bible that believing includes baptism nor that if one trusts christ he will be baptized
2926886 in john 3 5 is often quoted as if it referred to baptism
2926887 the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the holy ghost
2926888 by this birth of water and the spirit or cleansing of regeneration and being made alive by the holy spirit
2926889 all of that happens on the inside of every sinner who is born of god
2926890 i peter 3 21 is used as an argument that baptism saves people
2926891 the like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience toward god by the resurrection of jesus christ
2926892 baptism then is only a picture or figure of salvation and the man who is baptized should already have a
2926893 in hebrews 9 14 we are told how the conscience is to be purged by the blood of christ
2926894 for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ
2926895 the whole book of galatians is written to prove that people are saved not by works but by faith
2926896 in romans 6 3 with a phrase just like them in i corinthians 10 2
2926897 the word unto is a translation of the same greek word
2926898 what the lord says here is that as many as have been baptized for christ or pointing toward christ or picturing christ have publicly claimed him before the world as their saviour
2926899 of the death and resurrection of christ and also pictures the new life which the christians plan to live
2926900 and now why tarriest thou arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins calling on the name of the lord
2926901 brother saul the lord even jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest hath sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the holy ghost
2926902 nor did he mean acts 22 16 to contradict acts 13 39 where he told the people at antioch
2926903 to him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins
2926904 and he said to the woman thy faith hath saved thee go in peace
2926905 and jesus said unto him receive thy sight thy faith hath saved thee
2926906 i tell you this man went down to his house justified
2926907 at the time i was shaken up a bit but now im just trying to think clearly
2926908 were out of toilet paper and there are about 70 people lined up to use the bathroom
2926909 early in the season our pitching kept us in games and we found ways to win but right now were not playing well and were not swinging the bats great we have maybe one key at bat per game one at bat to do something and we havent capitalized on it
2926910 its great we got off to a good start and played that well but unfortunately it created some unrealistic expectations outside the organization
2926911 that said theres no reason we cant bounce back the next seven weeks and play the way we did in the first half
2926912 truthfully the results are nasty but i feel like i made some very good improvements today with my stuff
2926913 im going to keep fighting obviously i have to start getting outs and putting up zeros you can talk all day about feeling better
2926914 i know ive been in the league 23 months and the first 22 were pretty solid the last month was the first time ive experienced prolonged poor results and it will turn around im probably not going to see late innings when weve got a guy whos thrown 37 scoreless innings i understand that at the same time i expect that within a month from now sept 10 i will have righted my ship
2926915 more than anything its coincidence we played really really well the early part of the season and we expected to be a lot better than this
2926916 obviously the biggest thing is the offense we havent swung the bats well its been really bad its not fun at all
2926917 i think the volatility of young players combined with some of the injuries weve had created the perfect storm to have a bad stretch unfortunately
2926918 we didnt expect to lose 10 games in a row but we expected some tough times
2926919 polanco got one in the wind and carlos came two or three steps in and then had to sprint to the track
2926920 it was a swirling wind i was glad its 420 feet out there carlos has good makeup speed
2926921 it was not simple because the wind was kind of wild at first i thought it was in front of me but if i hurried and got too tight i might drop the ball so i tried to stay loose i knew id get there easy
2926922 as far as an organization trying to rebuild around young guys thats important
2926923 a lot of guys i know who were drafted its five or six deep at their positions im not saying im ahead of anybody in this organization but theres a good chance to speed up the process in the situation im in who knows what would have happened if i had been drafted by another organization im fortunate to be where i am and happy to be where i am
2926924 its not for sure hes signed yet as far as im concerned were not teammates yet at the time we were both trying to win for our schools if i had a chance to go back i probably would have said something to him
2926925 his emotions were running high it wasnt overboard compared to other guys you see
2926926 yes i was definitely excited to strike manny ramirez out
2926927 hes one of the greatest hitters in the game im young thats probably not going to happen again but im not saying it might not happen sometime in a big game in a different situation
2926928 when all of the judicial and appeals processes have exhausted themselves and when any of the three are subject to the death penalty australia will make a plea for clemency on their behalf at that time
2926929 when it comes to non australian citizens we make a judgement on a case by case basis
2926930 when it comes to terrorists who have been convicted and are subject to the death penalty australia does not as a matter of policy make representations on their behalf

2926989 if you look from 1995 you dont see any change that could be regarded as statistically significant for the last 13 or 14 years nothing has been happening

2927286 la notaci n tradicional el pentagrama es muy buena para representar la estructura de una melod a porque muestra qu nota est cerca de otra dice tymoczko que compone m sica cl sica jazz y rock pero no es muy til para representar una estructura arm nica porque ofrece muchas formas diferentes de mostrar un acorde por ejemplo de do mayor lo que logr es representar ambas estructuras al mismo tiempo
2927287 los m sicos en general se manejan en una determinada regi n sin saltar a otra demasiado r pido
2927288 ten amos herramientas disponibles para analizar las armon as tradicionales pero la m sica se ha vuelto m s compleja a medida que se usan acordes no tradicionales eso me llev a construir un modelo que permite visualizar cualquier tipo de acorde y c mo se relaciona con otros
2927289 esta pieza es misteriosa dado que usa armon as tradicionales pero conectadas con sucesiones de acordes poco comunes dif ciles de describir al escucharlas pero si se las pone sobre un espacio geom trico se puede ver que chopin se mueve entre espacios cortos y sobre todo restrigi ndose a una sola regi n
2927290 tiene muchos m s puntos de contacto con la m sica occidental tradicional de lo que se cre a
2927291 me encontr con que su m sica es mucho m s sistem tica de lo que cre a ten a un manejo muy sofisticado de las escalas y sus relaciones chopin debussy y hasta wagner suelen ser catalogados de rom nticos de tener un estilo m s aferrado al sentimiento que a la estructura compositiva pero es posible que simplemente no estuvi semos entendiendo esas estructuras
2927292 se puede usar el orbitfold para representar cualquier tipo de m sica pero los resultados pueden ser poco atractivos buena parte de la m sica no occidental usa una sola melod a por vez y en esos casos el gr fico no ofrece algo revelador uno ve a la m sica moverse a trav s de un c rculo lo mismo pasa con las armon as que no cambian a lo largo de una pieza eso lo hace menos interesante desde el punto de vista geom trico pero eso no implica que la m sica sea menos interesante
2927293 hasta hoy ninguna teor a hab a logrado articular principios generales que logren explicar cu ndo y por qu determinadas combinaciones de acordes y contrapuntos son posibles en forma eficiente
2927294 es un modelo descriptivo aunque de todas formas hay algunos principios generales que son compartidos por un amplio espectro de estilos el modelo que desarroll puede mostrar c mo estos principios pueden ser satisfechos simult neamente la m sica atonal por ejemplo abandona esos principios entonces mi trabajo no sirve para analizarla
2927295 permite visualizar la forma de escribir m sica que un p blico occidental encontrar a por lo menos agradable eso no significa que pueda mostrarle a la gente c mo hacer una obra maestra o algo que le gustar a a todo el mundo porque no existen esa clase de atajos en la m sica y la geometr a no va a ayudar a ser buen m sico a quien no tiene talento para serlo
2927296 hay per odos en que la cultura musical se renueva a s misma volviendo a los principios b sicos hay una oscilaci n entre la necesidad de simplicidad y complejidad y esta ltima se ve alimentada hoy en d a por la cantidad de informaci n disponible lo que ampl a el rango de t cnicas e influencias aunque antes tambi n hubo m sica incre blemente compleja como el ars subtilior en el siglo xiv es cierto que las f rmulas se repiten y todo funciona pero es que la complejidad no siempre es una virtud musical
2927297 estoy tratando de pasarlo a java uno de los lenguajes de programaci n m s populares para poder hacerlo p blico porque como est hecho hasta ahora s lo lo entiendo yo
2927298 en este momento concluye tymoczko estoy terminando un libro en el que intento unir ste con otros proyectos de teor a musical que desarroll en los ltimos diez a os hasta hoy la historia de la m sica occidental se ha contado sin tener en cuenta la evoluci n de la armon a y el contrapunto quiero usar estas nuevas ideas para contar la historia desde ah

2927320 we thought wed seen everything but this beats them all
2927321 whats the real reason that giving is declining in most churches today is it the economy
2927322 economic downturns do make religious people more conscientious about how and where they give and invest when wages are frozen commissions are smaller and prices are higher the coffers will be lighter thats a fact but the economy has very little to do with the decline in the number of coins that ring in todays coffers even when the economy was booming giving was waning giving has been declining for decades
2927323 a more important question is what motivates generosity at all regardless of the economy why would any person give anything
2927324 generosity is never tied to your circumstances but to your convictions if the economy had anything to do with giving the macedonians about whom saint paul wrote in sacred scripture had every reason to quarantine the meager resources they did have instead however and this is what shocked saint paul their generosity was outlandish
2927325 just as in macedonia this kind of outlandish generosity exists today
2927326 but it isnt because of sermons on tithing or the pulpit scolding of those who do not give if youre interest is in growing a spiritually healthy church motivation for giving must come from somewhere other than guilt for not giving or shame for giving too little
2927327 you never have to beg from people who have experienced grace
2927328 but you almost always have to beg from those who have not
2927329 if you find there is a decline in giving in your church look for a deficit of grace in peoples lives
2927330 it is there youll find the answers in your search for what motivates giving grace is the key that unlocks the door on the generosity quotient in a persons life
2927331 it marks our transition from a successful start up in the emerging field of cell phone recycling into the undisputed global leader in electronics sustainability
2927332 our goal was to develop a profitable company that was socially and environmentally responsible
2927333 through the dedication of a talented team of people recellular has exceeded all expectations with igcs support and investment we will dramatically expand the company and set the standard for success in electronics sustainability and clean tech operations
2927334 they have revolutionized the electronics sustainability industry by providing a convenient solution for consumers to recycle their used handsets while at the same time extracting enough value from these phones to build a successful business we have investigated many clean tech companies including many in the cell phone recycling arena and we felt that recellular was clearly the worlds most promising cell phone reuse and recycling firm
2927335 we chose to partner with igc because of their deep knowledge of the sector their experience with growth stage companies and the value they can bring through rich networks in the u s europe and asia
2927336 we processed almost 5 000 phones in our first year of business
2927337 today we get an average of 24 000 phones enough to fill seven mail trucks every day five days a week with the support and resources of igc we see the potential to double the number of mail trucks delivering to recellular in the very near future

2927348 there were many things that were quite strange about our life as children such as the fact that our mother stores up bread bins and bins of the stuff there was always mouldy bread stuck away in weird places because you never know when youve going to have to go hungry
2927349 i think on reflection that we had a sort of ghetto ised polish new zealand upbringing in which the polish element was a mishmash of distant cultural memories and techniques of refugee survival
2927350 the passing on of memories began to have a different resonance for me i realised that the tiny things that people could remember or maybe imagine were deep within the psyche of survival
2927351 the trauma of being taken from your home the horrors of the journey the internment in hard labour camps the death of parents and siblings the chance of surviving of somehow snatching enough food and making it to a refugee camp were all deeply scarring experiences
2927352 she was ashamed of having been a refugee and her story was secret and shameful as it was among many of the people who came to nz with her
2927353 for me her image on the cover is a celebration of her acceptance of the story
2927354 my relationship with my mother during my illness led me to realise that i didnt actually know anything much about how she came to new zealand or about the story of her experiences during the war
2927355 she would cry and cry when she came to visit me in my hospital bed i suppose i wanted my mother to be strong for me but i realised that for her the sight of someone lying skinny and sick in a white hospital bed meant that they were going to die
2927356 this was her experience of sickness in the refugee camps and the institutions that she journeyed through as a child
2927357 that would carry the whole journey from poland to nz and then used some of the fragments or memories from the interviews to draw out different experiences
2927358 these memories were often a first time telling there were many tears and i guess in the writing i felt that it was my responsibility to convey some of the depth of this experience
2927359 i knew that i needed to take my critical voice out of the writing and to let the real and imagined memories lead the narrative
2927360 she has been fifty for years but now ive turned fifty and she refuses to move on its a bit strange

2927413 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2927414 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2927415 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2927416 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2927417 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2927427 all california employers who are presently subject to or in the future may be subject to an administrative action before the california labor commissioner in which an award of wages is sought by a person not illegally authorized to work in the united states
2927428 since we had some additional funding at the end of the year we were able to support them

2927430 it was just sitting idle in our public works yard
2927431 they will get skills training from clovis and the red cross maximizing volunteer capacity in the community
2927432 wait a minute why not take a chance on that guy
2927433 as far as an organization trying to rebuild around young guys thats important
2927434 a lot of guys i know who were drafted its five or six deep at their positions im not saying im ahead of anybody in this organization but theres a good chance to speed up the process in the situation im in who knows what would have happened if i had been drafted by another organization im fortunate to be where i am and happy to be where i am
2927435 its not for sure hes signed yet as far as im concerned were not teammates yet at the time we were both trying to win for our schools if i had a chance to go back i probably would have said something to him
2927436 his emotions were running high it wasnt overboard compared to other guys you see
2927437 yes i was definitely excited to strike manny ramirez out
2927438 hes one of the greatest hitters in the game im young thats probably not going to happen again but im not saying it might not happen sometime in a big game in a different situation
2927439 its always pretty fun when you walk the dodgers off the field
2927440 theyve done it to us a lot in the past they did it to us in 04 to knock us out of the playoffs it was kind of good to give it back to them
2927441 this was a big series for us to keep our confidence going obviously for those guys in contention if theyre going to do it theyre going to have to go through us were going to have to push them
2927442 if he could do that i was pretty confident i could get to second and theres always a good chance hell beat it out
2927443 when all of the judicial and appeals processes have exhausted themselves and when any of the three are subject to the death penalty australia will make a plea for clemency on their behalf at that time
2927444 when it comes to non australian citizens we make a judgement on a case by case basis
2927445 when it comes to terrorists who have been convicted and are subject to the death penalty australia does not as a matter of policy make representations on their behalf
2927446 the west end is a world class destination with 3 5 million visitors every week and these cheap and tatty signs have no part in its future
2927447 visitors expect and enjoy the buzz of the busy streets around oxford street and covent garden but they do not want to fight their way past these signs cluttering up the pavement or see them disfiguring a beautiful conservation area
2927448 beim heimrennen m chte ich alles geben und den fans ein gutes ergebnis schenken
2927449 der peugeot 908 hdi fap gewann die ersten drei rennen und wir m chten nun auch noch die letzten zwei gewinnen und auch in der konstukteurswertung siegen
2927450 es ist vielleicht nicht die schnellste strecke aber sie ist sehr anspruchsvoll
2927451 die mercedes arena ist ziemlich eng und mit dem gro en sportwagen sicher nicht einfach zu fahren besonders viel spa machen d rfte mit dem r10 tdi die schnelle bergauf passage nach der dunlop kehre
2927452 der erste renneinsatz des rs spyder auf einer deutschen strecke noch dazu auf dem n rburgring ist nat rlich etwas ganz besonderes f r uns
2927453 das wird sicher spannend und f r die zuschauer ein echtes highlight
2927454 nach der langen pause der lms freue ich mich unb ndig auf das rennen am n rburgring
2927455 der kurs wird unserem auto besonders gut liegen denn der rs spyder ist mit seiner ausgezeichneten balance und dem hohen abtrieb bekannterma en ein kurvenk nstler
2927456 ich habe dort von mitte der achtziger an neun jahre lang reifentests auf porsche fahrzeugen absolviert und f hle mich unheimlich wohl in der eifel

2927459 he was in good spirits last night when i spoke with him and hes anxious to get back
2927460 like i said plaxico burress has to take care of plaxico burress
2927461 a lot of them came out and couldnt make it
2927462 and the nez perce went through here on the way to canada
2927463 but we only get a couple cars of grain a month the feed supply for the local hutterites and some other feeders
2927464 they said the lights were out in judith gap that everyone went to billings
2927465 but we do have a history of being cold and windy

2927467 but by the next morning he was drifted back in

2927472 i recently saw this magazine called j magazine that just came out however the pictures used of me inside its pages are two years old

2927478 am declarat ca probabil vom inregistra o pierdere in anul financiar curent din cauza tarifelor in scadere si a pretului in continuare mare al petrolului

2927480 tv ul este puternic noaptea iar radioul ziua cand magazinele sunt deschise
2927481 asa cum am estimat la inceputul anului 2008 segmentul de lcd uri si plasme reprezinta vedeta pietei de electronice anul acesta datorita tendintei generale de inlocuire a televizoarelor cu tub catodic si achizitia unora cu tub plat cat si organizarii unor evenimente majore precum campionatul european de fotbal si jocurile olimpice de la beijing
2927482 chiar daca jocurile olimpice de vara vor genera o crestere a vanzarilor de lcd uri si plasme usor mai mica fata de perioada premergatoare campionatului european de fotbal estimam ca acestea vor continua sa fie printre cele mai solicitate produse si in luna august astfel valoarea medie investita de catre clientii nostri in aceasta categorie de produse se ridica la aproximativ 2 000 de lei cele mai solicitate modele fiind cele cu diagonala de 32
2927483 tv ul este puternic noaptea iar radioul ziua cand magazinele sunt deschise
2927484 prima jumatate a anului 2008 a fost caracterizata de conditii de piata dificile si de o concurenta in crestere
2927485 brd s a adaptat la acest context desfasurand actiuni comerciale adecvate si continuand in acelasi timp implementarea proiectelor strategice legate de optimizarea instrumentelor informatice si de dezvoltarea canalelor de distributie

2927487 once i got into the weekend and holed a few putts it really was a question of the adrenaline keeping me going keeping me focused keeping me pushing along
2927488 to believe that i achieved something that others havent is very special
2927489 the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
2927490 next question please lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2927491 so long as i could hang in there i knew i would get my opportunity
2927492 what im not going to do is get on the 16th hole and try to hit it 40 yards left of the green
2927493 i tried to put a good solid swing to the middle of the green
2927494 i came out of it just a touch and it went in the water
2927495 i saw sergio in 2007 and could see the disappointment that there was
2927496 it was oakland hills and there was no carnoustie here
2927497 i felt i responded well he was obviously very good and things just happened his way
2927498 jason finished the race better than we could have asked for
2927499 it was unreal ive been a part of the teams at the last two olympics that came out behind and i think i wanted it more than anybody not just for myself but to show that we are the nation to beat in that relay
2927500 when you put the world record holder in at the end of the relay and go in behind them the chance of you taking them are slim to none
2927501 i feel like i should have got my hand on the wall first
2927502 i gave it everything i possibly had but they got me on the end i would have loved to have touched first but there was nothing much more i could do
2927503 i just said congratulations man to kitajima thats an awesome swim
2927504 several dozen russian bombers are in the georgian skies and have been attacking throughout the country over the past several hours
2927505 i was very firm with vladimir putin i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia
2927506 coming back to the table negotiations peace talks a political solution thats it easy to say very difficult to do
2927507 it is the most surreal world crisis i could ever imagine
2927508 would you be willing to accept one dollar and fifty cents
2927509 would you be willing to accept two dollars and fifty cents
2927510 even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind
2927511 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2927512 a few years ago nikk and cheryl were equals now everything has changed
2927513 nikks future now lies in cheryls hands but she hadnt banked on having to pass judgement on an old friend and he never expected to be auditioning in front of her
2927514 to me that was a strong indication of her love she is a fabulous person
2927515 very very very happy to report her condition is upgraded
2927516 theyre not at the point where they want to discuss the specific nature of the injuries
2927517 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts
2927518 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
2927519 its all about presence its all about being top of mind the more stages we continue to take ourselves off of the more difficult the overall mission becomes
2927520 in order to be more than the great white north or more than just a trading partner like others i think we have to show how interwoven the connections are and how broad that cultural mix really is
2927521 its an entr e point its a way to deal with people other than at the office nine to five about economic matters
2927522 i thought she was so against what my parents would approve of that i instantly loved her
2927523 but i feel like im starting to kind of prove myself that i can handle the nerves so hopefully maybe you guys will ease up a little bit
2927524 people say dont worry about it think of it as just another meet well its not another meet
2927525 you just have to say im going to go out there and try to have my best swim if it ends up i get a gold awesome
2927526 getting a bronze does still leave me a little bit hungry for something a little bit higher
2927527 do you prefer silver does that mean you prefer a silver medal
2927528 i was like my earrings have nothing to do with the medal i want i honestly want the gold
2927529 andrew combines natural talent with a sophisticated understanding of the game i think im pretty good about giving him information and feedback in all aspects of the game i also try to keep him in the right mental state for success
2927530 bills one of the elite coaches in the united states
2927531 hes not excitable hes good under pressure and thinks rationally hes cool exactly the same in the ninth inning with the bases loaded as he is at the top of the first
2927532 wherever he coaches sailors exhibit distinct performance improvements his experience patience and clarity motivate sailors to reach within themselves for new levels of achievement
2927533 the trials were great preparation for dealing with the pressure of the olympic regatta
2927534 the challenge now is sailing against a fleet comprised of the best laser sailors in the world
2927535 sailing is not a 10 second sport its a marathon
2927536 bill has a dry sense of humor when pressure cooker situations come if you cant have fun in those moments youre simply not going to perform bill provides a sense of normalcy
2927537 the laser class has more competitive depth than any other fleet at the games there are at least 15 guys who could medal
2927538 most of the guys ranked ahead of him will be at the games if you had to pick a favorite it would probably be australias tom slingsby the world no 1 and two time defending world champion
2927539 from a coaching perspective this changes what you emphasize in training and your role on race day
2927540 the length of the races puts a premium on boat speed so we end up spending the majority of training time working on speed during competition you are much farther from the action than in college sailing you collect information for your sailor like wind and current readings and provide general support
2927541 i like the medal race it creates a lot of excitement

2927555 i screamed with joy as soon as i saw the sms unmindful of the fact that i was travelling in a packed compartment in the suburban train
2927556 as those around stared at me strangely i broke the news to them and saw a lot of smiles in the compartment
2927557 we are of the view that fees should be finalised by the concerned iim boards what is the use of the board if we have to decide on the fee structure
2927558 the basic thrust of the committee is to study and suggest the roadmap on how to create excellence and expand management education
2927559 iims have to raise funding from outside in the us the b schools get funding from corporates the iims can look for similar things here
2927560 now things have changed a lot the economy is growing at eight to nine per cent there is heavy attrition rate in the market each company is trying to attract the better talented professionals by giving huge salary so we will study how to deal with the situation
2927561 hes too new and he needs to put some meat on his bones
2927562 frankly i thought he looked more like bob dole in the last days of the 1996 campaign saying look at the record look at the record and there was some anger and sense of frustration there he shouldnt show that he needs to show that nothing is getting to him its rolling off his back and i think he missed an opportunity to do that last week
2927563 mr mccain is running the absolute most pathetic campaign i have ever seen in my whole life his campaign is just heartbreakingly pathetic he is a very impressive guy he is a brave guy but he is running the most lackluster campaign i have ever seen in my entire life i would have thought bob doles campaign would have set a record for poor campaigns but this one is even worse i mean it is shocking
2927564 the candidate who started out talking about high minded civil debate has wholeheartedly adopted mr roves low minded and uncivil playbook mr mccain used to pride himself on being above this ugly brand of politics which killed his own 2000 presidential bid but he clearly tossed his inhibitions aside earlier this month when he put day to day management of his campaign in the hands of one acolyte of mr rove and gave top positions to two others the r sum s of the new teams members included stints in mr bushs white house and in his 2004 re election campaign one of the most negative and divisive in memory many voters are wondering whether a mccain presidency would be an extension of mr bushs two disastrous terms if the way mr mccain is running his campaign these days is an indication americans dont have to wait until next january for the answer to that one
2927565 for four days sen john mccain and his allies have accused sen barack obama of snubbing wounded soldiers by canceling a visit to a military hospital because he could not take reporters with him despite no evidence that the charge is true

2927573 erik hat im rennen eine superleistung gezeigt und sich um 14 pl tze verbessert doch im qualifying muss er sich weiter verbessern

2927581 i think many of our problems as a country would be solved if people had thick passports
2927582 theres just no substitute for actually going and seeing things
2927583 when you go to a country and see your fellow americans feeding people or getting clean water or saving their lives you are really seeing the best of us we are exporting the best of who we are and who we should be
2927584 ive been celibate for a year and starting to think i may never have sex again
2927585 the excitement of it the anxiousness of it the anticipation was just crazy im just glad its out of the way now now we can settle back in and really focus on our next opponents the game was just over the top
2927586 he basically came up to us and said im here to support you
2927587 this is a personal olympics for me everyone is proud it felt great all the flags and people were cheering
2927588 if you write a book and you said how am i going to start this game out yao hitting a three with the fist pump with the excitement it was great it was great for basketball and we couldnt do nothing but smile on the sideline
2927589 we understood that it was just bigger than the game
2927590 it wasnt just a finals game it wasnt a seventh game it was bigger than that
2927591 the repatriation efforts have not stopped deaths theres not even a decrease in deaths
2927592 this continues to be this deadly exorbitantly costly shell game
2927593 hes had a trail of stunning women running around after him and has been the life and soul of every party hes been to in the last week
2927594 most of the time by the end of the night he can barely stand up
2927595 but hes just like anyone else having fun on holiday with a group of mates
2927596 i wore a loose fitting t shirt it was very hot in london and its no secret i dont like wearing bras my boob fell out twice and people on the blogs are saying it was a publicity stunt
2927597 can i just say i have been keeping myself very much to myself recently ive been gardening decorating my new flat and looking after my grieving grandfather if i wanted publicity id be accepting invitations not to mention money for turning up to glamorous events
2927598 her name will be mentioned in some of the sketches before she appears as a punchline at the end of the series
2927599 its like saying that you didnt know that a physician was a perfect lunatic at a hospital the expectation is that a hospital would have sufficient monitoring to detect lunacy
2927600 one of the people that worked at the laboratory told me they had better security at a 7 eleven than they did at the laboratory where they had the most dangerous substances known to mankind
2927601 i think that anyone who is handling materials like this has a very heightened duty to make sure that they remain in a secure environment and that duty also extends to hiring employees who would be working in that environment to make sure that they are of sound mind
2927602 this guy was clearly a nut case and he wasnt a secret nut case and yet he was allowed to operate with unfettered access to these very lethal pathogens
2927603 its smell is all pervasive it makes huge amounts of mess and it distracts and annoys people intensely
2927604 popcorn is horrible stuff and i wont have it anywhere near my cinema
2927605 credo che i vertici si possano fissare quando c una proposta concreta da mettere sul piatto dice credo sia giusto recarsi prima a tbilisi e poi mosca per ascoltare entrambe le parti e certamente coinvolgere losce soltanto allora avremo delle proposte chiare da discutere in sede europea in modo da far lavorare osce e ue sulla stessa linea di azione
2927606 per fare la differenza necessario che leuropa rimanga unita cio che non si crei un gruppo antirusso e uno filorusso questo condannerebbe liniziativa al fallimento qualunque essa sia e condannerebbe uneventuale discussione al consiglio di sicurezza dellonu al veto della russia la seconda condizione che si lavori con losce che decise il peacekeeping e il congelamento del confine russo ed ovvio che deve essere un attore principale
2927607 i membri del consiglio di sicurezza europei assieme alla germania che nel caucaso gioca un ruolo importante devono avere lo stesso punto di vista sulla materia sarebbe pazzesco sottolinea frattini se in una discussione del genere in europa o ancora peggio in consiglio di sicurezza noi gli inglesi e magari altri avessimo opinioni diverse
2927608 il ritorno indietro allo status quo ante di qualche giorno fa
2927609 la georgia deve comprendere che se fa invasioni di campo queste sono totalmente controproducenti come lo sono i bombardamenti dellaeroporto di tbilisi da parte russa quindi il ritiro georgiano dallossezia del sud un bene
2927610 a queste condizioni dice il ministro leuropa pu scongiurare quel pericolo che vede bush cio il pericolo di un pregiudizio grave nelle relazioni con la russia siccome la russia rester comunque un partner strategico paesi come litalia scandisce il ministro devono lavorare affinch prevalga una posizione equilibrata e di questo sono molto convinto se prevalesse la posizione di quei paesi che a ogni pi sospinto pensano che la russia sia da allontanare sempre di pi chiaramente ci esporremmo a un nulla di fatto
2927611 ha il diritto di veto in consiglio di sicurezza e ha un potere di interdizione molto forte non solo su questo tema
2927612 o con la russia si dialoga su un livello globale o si rinuncia e si va verso un nulla di fatto
2927613 ecco perch sostengo la posizione espressa dalla francia e dal presidente sarkozy perch molto equilibrata fra le due parti
2927614 fissare subito una strategia di intervento umanitario per le popolazioni civili perch noi parliamo molto di guerra di pace di interventi di peacekeepeng ma qui ci sono migliaia di persone che hanno perso la casa i famigliari prima di tutto sar di questo che discuteremo a bruxelles
2927615 devo anche annunciare dice al foglio frattini che se ci fosse un intervento umanitario come spero ci sia litalia gi pronta a intervenire con la protezione civile italiana che ha delle capacit notevoli
2927616 per chiedergli di parlare con putin rivela frattini proprio per il ruolo che litalia pu svolgere nel dialogo con la federazione russa
2927617 i dont think we have to worry about invisible people walking around any time soon we are just at the beginning of doing anything like that
2927618 in naturally occurring material the index of refraction a measure of how light bends in a medium is positive
2927619 when you see a fish in the water the fish will appear to be in front of the position it really is or if you put a stick in the water the stick seems to bend away from you
2927620 instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water it would actually appear to be above the waters surface
2927621 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2927622 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient

2927627 i hope local people and organisations will have their say in the consultation period and get in touch with the post office
2927628 this particular air force exercise is important because india is included among some very important allies
2927629 this is definitely an extension of an arc that has been mapped out since 2000 and it really signifies that what india and the united states have is a strategic relationship
2927630 beijing would likely remain reticent about such training since it does not see itself as directly and imminently affected by such activities
2927631 we will learn how our allies operate in response to similar threats
2927632 it will allow us to build observations to eventually learn those lessons about what it takes to integrate talk fly with employ deploy and sustain air power with places like india korea and france

2927841 last year our local clubs served 19 892 youth a 10 percent increase from the year before but there are still many more children in our community that need the kind of positive influence and guidance the clubs provide and we want to reach out to these youth and their families
2927842 the cost of providing the boys amp girls club experience to one child for a year is about 300
2927843 you can see what a valuable investment that is when you compare it to the cost of incarcerating a youth who go in the wrong direction usually 50 000 or more the clubs give a good return on investment
2927844 this rule is not charity but a necessary life saving measure
2927845 we have been looking forward to getting to this point and are very excited to see our first store open for business
2927846 this is only the beginning of what you will see at the shoppes at rio grande valley as the region and the city of edinburg grows so will the shoppes at rio grande valley
2927847 following jc penney will be the opening of burlington coat factory in mid august
2927848 tj maxx the shoe department and academy sports will open in the fall of this year in time for the holiday season more store openings will follow into next year with the addition of lane bryant ross dress for less and first national bank during the early part of 2009
2927849 the american college of surgeons commission on cancer coming together 2008 a national forum on cancer care in the united states
2927850 i am always overwhelmed when i am in the company of people whose goals and passions are to eliminate cancer and improve the quality of life of those affected with it
2927851 following my presentation people came to me clearly interested in duplicating what we were able to do in passing proposition 15 maybe we will see other such bills pass across the united states
2927852 the growth of the south texas market is quite evident as national retailers like ross dress for less open multiple locations throughout the market
2927853 we are proud to offer an optimal site to accommodate rosss expansion plans and facilitate growth of their customer base in the region
2927854 our teachers and campus leaders deserve the credit for the childrens success in mastering the texas assessment of knowledge and skills taks test
2927855 at the beginning of the 2007 2008 school year we challenged our campus principals and teachers to go the extra degree in their teaching and their focus on helping students achieve success and that is just what they did
2927856 our school board and our administration take their hats off to the schools and their leaders
2927857 we also salute the students and their parents for aiming high and supporting the districts push to help every child master the taks
2927858 it is no coincidence that the ecisd has become a leader in education in the valley the region one area and the state
2927859 we have a community that cares about its children and makes education a priority our teachers our parents our business community our school board and our school administration are united in supporting the educational success of students at all levels
2927860 list thirty three schools received gold performance acknowledgements from the texas education agency for high academic performance in 14 different categories
2927861 immunizations are important particularly for children in a school setting because students spend a large amount of time in close situations
2927862 if any of these children are unvaccinated the potential is there for an outbreak to occur
2927863 we forget the days when americans were hit with polio some died some live with life long disabilities
2927864 today polio only exists in a few countries around the world and the united states has not had a case of polio since 1979
2927865 many texas residents are unprepared for the fast approaching dtv transition especially those who live along the border households that continue watching stations from mexico rather than taking steps to prepare for the transition may not receive amber alert and emergency alert system messages
2927866 the senate passed bill will give border broadcasters flexibility to broadcast in both analog and digital formats beyond the transition date so border residents access to important public safety information is not threatened
2927867 the united states constitution plainly protects young texans right to observe a moment of silence before school each morning
2927868 in an age where children are bombarded with distractions beginning each school day with a moment of silence offers a welcome moment of thoughtful contemplation the state of texas will work diligently to defend the law and uphold the district courts decision which ruled that texas moment of silence statute is entirely constitutional
2927869 any other silent activity that is not likely to interfere with or distract another student
2927870 by providing a patriotic and contemplative context for the minute of silence senate bill 83 plainly serves secular rather than religious purposes
2927871 the purpose of these exercises is plain to foster patriotism and provide an opportunity for students to engage in thoughtful contemplation
2927872 the plaintiffs argument turns the first amendment on its head their reasoning would condemn any law that prevents discrimination against religion by expressly protecting the right of students to pray including numerous federal and state laws that protect students against religious hostility
2927873 we are very excited about this grant and the donation because it allows us to continue our work to help community members of all ages understand topics ranging from personal money management to entrepreneurship challenges and opportunities to business ethics to national economic impacts
2927874 our projects are geared at making a difference in peoples lives and creating a better quality of life for our communities we want to thank citifinancial for continuing to play a big part in our success
2927875 it was a pleasure to award these funds to stc because the work of its students it crucial to the communities it serves
2927876 we look forward to continuing to seeing the good work of this group and know that they will positively impact many lives through this grant
2927877 this debt collection firm is charged with unlawfully harassing texas debtors
2927878 at a time when too many texans are struggling to protect their homes the defendants unlawful letters are threatening debtors with legal action homestead liens and wage garnishment in violation of the law the office of the attorney general will vigorously enforce laws that prevent debt collectors from harassing or threatening texas consumers
2927879 through his work with the american legislative exchange council speaker craddick has been a leader and a driving force in solidifying policy solutions and promoting alec principals and ideas
2927880 he is a great example for all of us to emulate in our home states
2927881 my greatest privilege has been to serve the people of texas to ensure that their needs are met texas best days are ahead and i am proud that it is a place where people can prosper i would like to thank senator feris the alec executive board of directors the texas state leadership and my constituents for their continuing support
2927882 you have the ability now to insert money into freddie mac and fannie mae do you think that thats gonna become necessary given the size of these losses
2927883 well we have no plans to insert money in either of those institutions
2927884 the positive effects of lower tax rates will be offset by the costs of increased government debt
2927885 the fall in wealth will mean that uk household spending growth is likely to slow to just 0 5 in 2009
2927886 however that will not be enough in itself to push the uk into recession we are sailing pretty close to recession but it will take something else to push us over the edge
2927887 the jobs market has been one of the few bright spots in the uk economy but cracks are appearing in the face of an increasingly uncertain economic outlook
2927888 medical science has proven that the keys to changing the outcom
2927889 focused on the add on revenue and generated ill will
2927890 it wouldnt be summer without coming to the ex tens of thousands expected in lawrencetown for the 82nd annual annapolis valley exhibition
2927891 it wouldnt be summer for our family without coming to the ex
2927892 taylor is learning values such as responsibility but she is also looking forward to the rides and seeing her cousins
2927893 exhibitors are still coming in the same numbers so we hope the public will come as well despite high gas prices
2927894 if we cant be on a better footing financially a year from now we are done im sorry to say
2927895 weve got to go outside the membership to get new blood and ideas
2927896 the response from the community has been terrific it is very encouraging
2927897 it is a great community centre the place where we come to celebrate as a community
2927898 there is not a non profit organization in this town that has not used the building for practical and fundraising purposes
2927899 the people who have tested positive will automatically be able to file a workmens compensation claim
2927900 at the beginning of july they held two more clinics and this time they concentrated on retirees and people with long service
2927901 to my knowledge there are a couple of people who have tested positive for asbestos but are not sick
2927902 everyone has been taking asbestos awareness training in order to work on the freighter
2927903 everyone is now aware that there is asbestos on the freighter encapsulated so if they see anything suspicious they know how to properly address it and what to do to handle it appropriately
2927904 im not comfortable walking away from what i started there
2927905 at first i really debated whether i had the guts to take the year off whether i had the finances to do it and then worried about how i could make it happen
2927906 the wealth of a maasai man is measured by the number of his livestock wives and children in that order and unfortunately not by his ability to care for them
2927907 each wife spends her days tending to the homestead and preparing food women are occupied with running the maasai household gathering and chopping firewood collecting water preparing meals and feeding children with very little food repairing and maintaining their bomas personal huts and attending to the needs of their husbands these duties are somehow balanced with occasionally selling enough vegetables to earn a meagre income
2927908 the children had a keen hunger to learn that ive never seen before they know education is their way out of poverty some walk 1 1 2 hours to get to school im not sure where the desire comes from because the public school system fails them
2927909 we have so much fun being together that we wanted to do something to share that good feeling with others
2927910 the crocheting is fun and in your mind you know you are doing something good for someone else and its a really good feeling
2927911 i had a box of wool that was just odds and ends so we thought we would try to make one
2927912 and well we had so much fun that we kept going and now we have at least 14 already put together and arent stopping yet
2927913 its only supposed to be until 11 but were usually here until at least noon and then we work on them on our own too
2927914 we average about two afghans a week and we cant wait to hand them out
2927915 one of the women in our group has already delivered one to an elderly lady in middleton because it was her birthday and she was so pleased
2927916 its always nice to do a little good for someone else and i just love elderly people they are near and dear to my heart so its nice to be able to give them an afghan to keep them warm while they are sitting and even more so to let them know that someone cares well all get there someday and i can only hope that someone will be so kind to me
2927917 the fall in wealth will mean that uk household spending growth is likely to slow to just 0 5 in 2009
2927918 however that will not be enough in itself to push the uk into recession we are sailing pretty close to recession but it will take something else to push us over the edge
2927919 the jobs market has been one of the few bright spots in the uk economy but cracks are appearing in the face of an increasingly uncertain economic outlook
2927920 definitely a peoples person our world will never be the same without him
2927921 we need to engage them we need to take care of them we should not forget about them
2927922 promise to our fellow human beings the generosity god has shown us
2927923 it wouldnt be summer without coming to the ex tens of thousands expected for the annapolis valley exhibition
2927924 it wouldnt be summer for our family without coming to the ex
2927925 taylor is learning values such as responsibility but she is also looking forward to the rides and seeing her cousins

2927927 sie wollte sich mir nicht unterordnen das konnte ich nicht zulassen
2927928 der mann hat daraufhin das kind an einen sessel gefesselt und stranguliert bis es blau war er h rte erst auf als die frau versprach zu bleiben
2927929 um mitternacht ging der strom aus ab dem zeitpunkt dachte ich dass die welt untergeht
2927930 ich war mit freunden in einer ferienwohnung in grado pineta ich ging fr h schlafen bin aber um halb zw lf vom l rm aufgewacht

2927933 with much of their time dedicated to these technological marvels we should ask ourselves how many of our young adults know how these products work how are they designed manufactured
2927934 were not put in the press and held up like rock stars and sports figures
2927935 fiquei muito feliz obviamente mas tamb m muito aliviado este clube tem uma hist ria fant stica muitos jogadores tinham atingido o sucesso e conquistado a ta a dos campe es pelo que a equipa estava sob uma enorme press o naquela final ramos obrigados a vencer por isso quando acordei no dia seguinte senti uma mistura de alegria e emo o mas tamb m de al vio por termos conquistado o t tulo europeu
2927936 gosto de ser capit o do liverpool sinto me honrado por envergar a bra adeira
2927937 ajuda me a jogar melhor tento entrar em campo e dar o exemplo para ter sucesso e chegar gl ria neste desporto s o precisos muitos sacrif cios render sob press o e ter muita responsabilidade
2927938 todas as equipas de sucesso t m pelo menos um jogador formado nos seus escal es jovens n s temos a sorte de ter dois eu e o jamie carragher uma boa liga o entre os adeptos e a equipa tamb m ajuda os outros jogadores a perceberem quais s o os objectivos do clube servindo ainda para transmitir a hist ria do mesmo quando somos da terra temos a responsabilidade de ajudar os jogadores estrangeiros a integrarem se e a fazer tudo para que se sintam felizes quando estamos no balne rio antes de um jogo grande eles v m a nossa atitude e a forma como nos comportamos desta forma ficam com a ideia da import ncia de vestir esta camisola
2927939 est vamos a perder por 3 0 ao intervalo e havia muitas caras tristes de adeptos nas bancadas e de jogadores no balne rio
2927940 tinha a responsabilidade de tentar animar a equipa de dizer aos meus colegas que nada estava perdido esse golo deu esperan a equipa
2927941 foi um milagre estar a perder por 3 0 e conseguir chegar ao empate a tr s golos depois veio o prolongamento e as grandes penalidades a espectacular defesa do jerzy dudek no final do prolongamento e depois o andrei shevchenko que foi um dos melhores jogadores que alguma vez defrontei a falhar um pontap no desempate o desfecho do jogo foi um verdadeiro milagre
2927942 dif cil perceber as causas da irregularidade da nossa equipa na liga tanto mais que consegue ser s lida regular muito consistente e dif cil de bater na europa na premier league somos obrigados a ser consistentes nas 38 jornadas enquanto na ta a dos campe es tudo se decide em apenas dois jogos

2927951 en halt h st skickar man v l inte till slakt det f rsta man g r d hj lper man den ju till veterin r eller kollar med en hovslagare han var ju f r sjutton bara 12 r gammal han hade kunnat leva den dubbla tiden minst
2927952 jamen jag hade inte l ngre r d att betala uppeh llet f r honom
2927953 vad jag vet kostade han oss ingenting just d eftersom han var utackorderad till annan familj som stod f r hans omkostnader
2927954 jag var ju ut och dansade med ture 4 kv llar i veckan
2927955 ja ture hade ju mycket mer utsv vande liv n vad jag hade och jag ville ju kunna f lja med annars hade han kanske inte velat ha mig
2927956 och f r att kunna g ra det var du tvungen att skicka min h st till slakt
2927957 nej s var det inte nej s var det inte
2927958 och du skickade honom till slakt vad r det f r skillnad p att du skickade min h st till slakt och att din far skj t din katt och hund

2927963 the crowd was brilliant and the atmosphere was wonderful it was great to be back
2927964 the time was too tight and that had an influence on a lot of the results
2927965 and eddie is one my best pals so im really happy for him
2927966 give yourself a good shaking and give the horse one too you can do it
2927967 it was a big deal making that decision but it doesnt mean that i dont love ireland any more i love both countries equally and i got great support from the crowd every time i was in the ring today
2927968 we could have done it we should have done it
2927969 we let it slip badly in the first round eddie had 14 faults and cian oconnor had a spectacularly good round up to the final fence where it all went wrong for him but the resolve and nerve and determination we showed in the second round was fantastic fair play to them all it was a great recovery and we came so close to winning i think it is now vital we put together the strongest team possible for the final in barcelona
2927970 grandma youve worked your fingers to the bone you deserve this

2927973 why harry potter became a phenomenon while artemis fowl only remains a huge sensation is a conundrum for future ages to ponder
2927974 the original vision at the heart of shared worlds has always been the desire to provide a place where oddball kids like me could get together and play with ideas
2927975 we feel that a customer would want to buy products that cesar recommends since hes a specialist in his field
2927976 weve already got 30 000 people reading ereader books on iphone ipod touch just one month after launch
2927977 about ten percent of our kindle customers have also switched to iphone ipod touch uploads for all or part of their purchases that began of course in mid july
2927978 i have received dozens of e mails from people saying they were going to buy a kindle but once they saw ereader on iphone they decided against it in one case they sold their already bought kindle the day after reading their first book on iphone itouch
2927979 you can even see several reviews on itunes of the ereader for iphone products where people say they decided not to buy kindles because iphone ereader worked well for them
2927980 so this leak occurred shortly after the iphone app store began anecdotally at least to dry up their supply of potential customers hmmm i dont know what the real kindle figures are but as they say in politics the timing seems suspicious
2927981 im delighted to be appointed as the sixteenth queen victoria eugenia chair its quite an honour and an important symbol of the closeness of spanish british relations

2927983 i shall use my three public lectures as an opportunity to give the spanish public an opportunity to learn more about luisa de carvajal whose life is of great historical importance to both our countries but is hardly known in spain

2928028 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2928029 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2928030 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world

2928035 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2928036 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2928037 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2928038 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2928039 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2928040 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2928041 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2928042 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2928043 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2928044 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2928045 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2928046 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2928047 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2928048 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2928049 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2928050 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2928051 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2928052 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2928053 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2928054 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2928055 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2928056 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2928057 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2928058 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2928059 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2928060 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2928061 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2928062 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2928063 who are open to doing something on the production side
2928064 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2928065 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2928066 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2928067 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2928068 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2928069 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2928070 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2928071 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2928072 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2928073 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2928074 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2928075 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2928076 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2928077 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2928078 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2928079 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2928080 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2928081 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2928082 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2928083 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2928084 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2928085 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2928086 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2928087 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2928088 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2928089 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2928090 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2928091 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2928092 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2928093 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2928094 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2928095 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2928096 a partir do momento em que fico no banco que estou disposi o e 100 fisicamente clinicamente estou bem fiz muito trabalho f sico dei v rios piques n o senti nenhum tipo de dor espero poder ajudar a sele o quando for chamado
2928097 o breno um grande jogador apesar da pouca idade ele j tem experi ncia quem ganha com isso a sele o brasileira
2928098 usually its so hot the ice creams just pouring off the cone
2928099 we always enjoy listening to some music and getting some good food
2928100 but people were really good sports they just kind of went where the music was
2928101 we used to go to wedding dances all the time
2928102 that was entertainment and they used to always play polka music like this
2928103 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2928104 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2928105 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2928106 you could compare it asian music to what happened to reggae through the seventies
2928107 it was a music that expressed the voice of a small community its now a british form of music it has earned its place in the history of music
2928108 ik weet dat hij in staat is om 47 seconden te klokken
2928109 je kunt splittijdens tijden de estafette ook niet zomaar vertalen naar individuele tijden
2928110 dit is te gek voor woorden cramer moet de subsidies stopzetten laat ze het geld zelf maar binnenhalen
2928111 als clubs iets belangrijk vinden moeten ze er zelf geld in steken activisme moet niet worden gesubsidieerd
2928112 dit is verwerpelijk gesubsidieerde instellingen mogen nooit als doel hebben sectoren in een kwaad daglicht te stellen
2928113 at this point theres an investigation and there could be charges at the conclusion of the investigation
2928114 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2928115 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2928116 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2928117 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2928118 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2928119 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2928120 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2928121 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2928122 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2928123 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2928124 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2928125 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2928126 ive never seen anything like this in my career for software
2928127 as soon as the giant cauldron was lit i instantly felt relaxed i was exhausted but also excited
2928128 almost all the torches used outside the mainland went through my hands one by one
2928129 the way the cauldron was lit was extremely risky i dont think the designers ever considered the possibility that the torchs flame might go out
2928130 imagine the wind up there dozens of metres up in the air there was no contingency plan just one man hanging there
2928131 the loop around the birds nest took four minutes and 50 seconds and the xiangyun normally burns for 15 minutes
2928132 for a gas appliance maker like us torch manufacturing is a great way to participate in sports
2928133 at the moment it seems to be a lot of posturing and the two sides showing each other how big their guns are
2928134 i hope the violence can end before any more people are killed
2928135 mera pind a regional punjabi film took place in chandigarh on saturday
2928136 we used to feel bad about the fact that although the biggest bollywood films have punjabi songs story and characters but when we look towards the punjabi films and cinema we had not achieved as much
2928137 my biggest motivation for doing this film was that for the first time a sensible director had started making good sensible punjabi films who besides having a vast experience in film making was in love with punjab and his mother tongue he was not making a film out of any motive like to make quick profit but was making a film with an aim to take punjabi films to a new height
2928138 i think many of our problems as a country would be solved if people had thick passports
2928139 there s just no substitute for actually going and seeing things
2928140 you start to feel a level of responsibility to direct attention to things that actually matter more than to silly things like who you
2928141 for a lot of actors our biggest fear is that we
2928142 i realized that because of president bush s malaria initiative this baby had survived

2928144 if or when we get to the point where we have evidence we believe would give us the probability of convicting mr macon for these or any other crimes then we would proceed
2928145 i know hes never going to get out of prison
2928146 but i still want him charged with my sisters murder
2928147 the ability to stand up in court and tell him what hes done to our family is extremely important to us
2928148 weve told prosecutors from the very beginning that were grateful for the other families
2928149 but we dont want them to stop there we want to know what happened
2928150 its never been a consideration and i dont think it ever will be
2928151 criminal justice has always been a priority of the ingham county board of commissioners
2928152 i think its ridiculous that it takes a year to decide anything
2928153 we moeten de goede dingen eruit halen en leren van onze fouten
2928154 aanvallend hebben we het goed gedaan al was ons powerplay nog niet zo effectief maar negen keer scoren tegen een ploeg als hongarije is gewoon goed elf tegentreffers is echter te veel we zullen als ploeg echt scherper moeten gaan verdedigen als we in het toernooi willen blijven
2928155 ja er vielen inderdaad een paar lullige doelpunten maar dat kwam ook doordat wij de schutters van afstand niet goed blokkeerden
2928156 ze is misschien wel het grootste keeperstalent van de wereld maar ze zat vanaf het begin niet lekker in de wedstrijd jammer dat het nu net op dit grote podium moet gebeuren ilse kan echt veel beter presteren dan in deze wedstrijd ze blijft daarom absoluut mijn nummer 1 in de komende wedstrijden tegen griekenland en australi

2928222 perhaps most importantly i remember turning 21 and being the big nerd i was having my first legal drink be a beer at chipotle before wandering over to catch a matinee showing of the latest harry potter movie

2928240 actually an amenity to do what you want to do which is to bring people to the riverfront
2928241 thinking about how development can happen north and south of both of these sites is an important aspect
2928242 on both sites there is potential for major public access by minor modifications from the casino developers you could deliver on your goals
2928243 the developers know that what theyve done is sort of land banked it
2928244 activity generators that will prime the pump for other properties
2928245 the key is to optimize the publics access to the river i actually think youre on your way
2928246 tim magill is saying they could be but not necessarily that they will be the real concern is that there is clearly not a parking solution and were going to push back hard to see where things fall in terms of the civic vision were here in an advisory capacity
2928247 there can be no deal breakers there are tools related to energy and emissions that are just not there yet we have a set of mechanisms that we are working toward

2928253 out of the barn or partially out of the barn
2928254 these casinos started the design process and we as a city are trying to change the rules
2928255 the development of a master plan is absolutely essential weve all got to realize that were playing catch up
2928256 the report thats issued will be used as a political tool by various constituencies so its important to be sure about what would it look like for a casino on that site to comply

2928267 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2928268 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2928269 several dozen russian bombers are in the georgian skies and have been attacking throughout the country over the past several hours
2928270 overnight as many as 50 russian bombers were reported operating simultaneuosly over georgia
2928271 if the ultimatum is rejected all necessary enforcement measures will be used
2928272 the consulting parties are in agreement that additional investigations need to be carried out to determine if any remains of british redoubt no 1 still exist within the permit area and what condition they may be in today given the extent of ground disturbance since the 18th century
2928273 we believe this is an appropriate step to take in order to determine the presence of remains and if extant whether they retain sufficient integrity to be eligible for listing in the national register of historic places
2928274 whether historic properties exist in the area that may be adversely affected by new construction
2928275 the philadelphia district does not currently have a professional archaeologist on its staff and the controversial preservation issues in this case are archaeological in nature

2928277 i was encouraged i think everything is moving in the right direction
2928278 the pennsylvania horticultural society has a long and successful record of creating high quality landscaping for some of philadelphias most prominent public spaces phs beautifying the rodin block will contribute to a dramatic improvement for the parkway likewise the new park at 12th and catharine will be a wonderful addition to a reborn hawthorne neighborhood
2928279 its a wonderful moment to be here today we have to end the notion that parks and development have to be just in center city we have to have both all over philadelphia
2928280 we need to see this kind of community engagement all over philadelphia use it for a model for all of philadelphia
2928281 this is no longer a highway but a quality pedestrian place in the city and a quality public space
2928282 now walkable public spaces are the ones that are thriving in cities the best is yet to come on the parkway
2928283 the significance is going to be ok now theres some dollars to back these things up and its up to us now to make sure they get done and thats a good thing
2928284 there is much need for infrastructure improvements and additional dollars for planning for parts of the parkway that are currently not working like the sister cities plaza near the basilica its great to see a combination of public and private investors in the parkway
2928285 independent third party analysis of the current casino site plans
2928286 you are not an independent voice in the casino debate
2928287 even before being tasked by the mayor to conduct an analysis you concluded that casinos do not fit into your vision of the waterfront
2928288 were not going to be taking sides whether these are good or bad developments
2928289 youll note that theres a lot of can be fixed in this
2928290 the whole thing was developed in a truly suburban fashion for me part of what needs to happen is that a we dont make those same mistakes over and over again and b to see if theres a way to mitigate it
2928291 they are prepared to make big investments but they might not be the investments we want to see long term

2928294 sexual abuse is virtually a fact of life for incarcerated women in the us
2928295 being a woman prisoner in american prisons can be a terrifying experience
2928296 there are often male correctional officers watching women undressing and showering the women are often afraid to report such incidences not only do the guards frequently threaten to take away visitation rights to keep them quiet they also have complete access to each inmates file which includes any reports against the guards if a guard is reported and punished the punishment usually only consists of his transfer to another facility

2928306 i wonder if he would agree to have a photo
2928307 i remember the crash and then there was a beautiful light and then the canadian and the scot and i were standing at the gates of heaven st peter approached us and said that we were all too young to die and that for a donation of 100 we could return to the earth
2928308 so of course i pulled out my wallet and gave him the 100 and the next thing i knew i was back here
2928309 the scot was haggling over the price and the canadian was waiting for the government to pay for his
2928310 father ive traveled all over america and ive seen this same golden telephone in many churches im told that it is a direct line to heaven but in the us the price was 10 000 per call why is it so cheap here
2928311 i think the safety issue is one thats being stressed but its just an engineering problem and an engineering challenge
2928312 we have to go through it and be rigorous but its just like numerous other challenges on the car
2928313 we will all be trying to overheat or overcharge batteries
2928314 those who will use flywheels will all be trying to crash flywheels
2928315 it is still possible but clearly very tight to get something from the system at the start of the season
2928316 would you choose water over wine hold the wheel and drive
2928317 would you choose water over wine hold the wheel and drive
2928318 i will grant you one wish each who wants to go first
2928319 my wish is to have a 2 lane highway across new brunswick smooth as a babys arse
2928320 poof there you go a highway as smooth as a babys arse
2928321 well i am going next genie i want a 20 foot wall around the border of quebec to keep all the damn englishmen out
2928322 poof theres your 20 foot wall now newfie it is your turn what do you want
2928323 genie is that wall you just put around quebec waterproof
2928324 de skyldiga ska f det straff de f rtj nar
2928325 down on the bottom of the sea lie all the proud cities and the worldly treasures corrupted with evil and those people who found no time to sing praises to their creator from the top of their hills
2928326 a land on the far east on the borders of the great waters where the sun comes up and where the white man sank into the hole in the ocean
2928327 nun da das bolivianische volk mit seiner wahl den wechsel des fr her g ltigen wirtschaftsmodells des neoliberalismus beschlossen hat m chte ich jeden b rgermeister jeden gouverneur dazu aufrufen sich dieser demokratischen revolution anzuschlie en sich anzuschlie en um die nationalisierung unserer nat rlichen ressourcen zu garantieren
2928328 faithful is he that calleth you who also will do it
2928329 but for them also which shall believe on me through their word
2928330 my people shall be willing in the day of my power
2928331 i will divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong
2928332 if god calls me to battle of course i will rise to the occasion
2928333 if the lord told you today that his will for you was lifelong singleness would you be ok with that
2928334 but i have to believe that the lord wont just drop that on me without preparing my heart to submit first i have to believe he would make me ready to hear and accept that without it just destroying me
2928335 i made my commitment to this church years ago so this is nothing new or extremely significant to me
2928336 we this group assembled together believe this about god and are committed to living as such for the sake of his glory the furtherance of his kingdom and our mutual sanctification
2928337 and heavs peace and perfect justice kissed a guilty world in love
2928338 he who seeks to save his life shall lose it
2928339 see i said you would have fun and you did didnt you
2928340 there is a name every day thats the name of the business
2928341 weve got one or two options we are looking at and hopefully we will get something sorted before the start of the season
2928342 i know there is this issue about scoring goals at the moment but if you are making chances as numerous as we did against portsmouth then we shouldnt worry about it they will eventually come players will come back and we may eventually add to the squad
2928343 our solid performance reported at the end of the first quarter has continued throughout the first half of the financial year
2928344 we have seen a strong operational performance on the outsourcing contracts and the direct property investments portfolio and this has left us in a good cash position at the end of the first half
2928345 a disparidade entre os valores anunciados e aqueles que aparecem nas propostas explicado por uma
2928346 enquanto o custo divulgado pelo governo o t pico custo de constru o da via a rubrica

2928349 its not a major oil producer but there are major transport links to europe through that region
2928350 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2928351 losses have been pretty sharp in the last few weeks and theres always someone looking to buy on the dip
2928352 there were two bombings one at the kojori military base and another on mt makhata as far as i know there are no casualties
2928353 i was very firm with vladimir putin i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia
2928354 it has opened my eyes to different cultures better players
2928355 this is no more backyard baseball its the real deal
2928356 i los angeles player ron miller scores before brian van de brant of detroit gets the ball during the reviving baseball in inner cities game in carson detroit came from behind to beat los angeles 8 7 bruce hazelton staff photographer got friends now in tampa i got friends in cleveland now it has opened a lot of new doors
2928357 but were trying to impart life lessons to these kids
2928358 hes a good kid an honor student at his school a real gentleman
2928359 theres been situations where he has stepped up in leadership roles when there was a conflict telling detroits catcher brian van de brent rushes to embrace curtis lambkin center and cbasthon alvarado after beating los angeles on sunday the youth league was founded in 1989 bruce hazelton staff photographer his peers to do the right thing
2928360 many of them play in communities with sand lots poorly maintained so this is really a major league experience for them
2928361 nobody put their heads down they came out fighting and we came out with the win
2928362 yvonne had lost against this opponent already at the past world championships
2928363 the americans were going to smash them thats what they came here for
2928364 theres no room in the nfl for 6 foot 1 200 pound guys with no mobility
2928365 i think football is a little like a no smoking sign in this clubhouse
2928366 i dont think im allowed to be too close to football
2928367 he told me that he had the biggest guts of anyone hed ever coached
2928368 it never really played with my head from the day i chose not to play
2928369 im a professional if im going out there worrying about something like that then im not doing my job here once i made my decision wipe my hands clean clean slate that was that
2928370 we brought him along a lot quicker than we would have other kids
2928371 but what else am i doing ive got nobody else to entertain except myself
2928372 chicago is a big notre dame town so its kind of double duty playing for the cubs playing for notre dame a lot of people say hey whats going on nobodys been rude its been a lot of fun winning games helps
2928373 weve been playing much better outfield defense and this is a hard place to play the outfield kosuke fukodome has made a big difference in right and both guys in center have made a difference
2928374 this place has been going bonkers but its always going bonkers when youre going good
2928375 its a unique place to play but its never felt like this
2928376 i dont think age has anything to do with it
2928377 i think its about makeup confidence stuff jonathan papelbon is a perfect example he was a starter they put him in that role and he took off
2928378 i kept my head straight i had a plan of what i wanted to do and where i wanted to be
2928379 i didnt choose baseball to play in the minor leagues theres more riding on this you know there are consequences to not doing well but i love having that on my shoulders its a lot of fun
2928380 i feel like hes been here longer than just a month
2928381 hes so used to being on the big stage playing in front of 100 000 people hes a guy whos had success his whole life its one of those things where he knows hes good but expresses it in a very subdued way hes not arrogant or cocky
2928382 i get sleepy at 7 oclock i have been to the opening ceremony in sydney and was in a foul mood by the time 5 oclock came along
2928383 after seven hours of standing i have got to preserve my body
2928384 i just choose not to stay in the village because i like privacy and i dont want people around me and all that other stuff
2928385 there are a lot of basketball players who are not in the village a lot of athletes who are staying in hotels
2928386 i went to the village the other day and was bombarded with lots of people and lots of photos
2928387 i was a little panicky at first me being the youngest and least experienced
2928388 alicia whipped me back in shape she said everything would be fine we cant change because of this theres nothing you can do
2928389 sam is almost like a sister to me the whole team kind of felt her pain and what she has gone through she was like youve got to take first man up on floor and gave us a lot of pep talks you could hear her cheering on every element
2928390 in international competition you never really know how the scores will go i wouldve liked to do a little better especially on bars
2928391 we knew bridget would come through when she had to
2928392 its a tough thing when one of us has an injury but the rest of us have confidence in each other
2928393 were all happy with the way we have responded to everything in these two weeks were able to endure put our best foot forward im sure we will do that in team finals
2928394 yvonne had lost against this opponent already at the past world championships
2928395 and its a spanish rider which shows that we have a problem in its time that spanish authorities start to do something concretely for years they have not been tough enough on doping and this is the result of their leniency
2928396 we were in the gymnasium and i asked him bryant if i could have my photograph taken with him
2928397 he replied by asking about my hamstring injury and said that i was in his heart i didnt know what to expect from approaching him
2928398 i was so excited that i rang my mother and said kobe asked me about my leg
2928399 the other night at the opening ceremony there were all these people chanting kobe kobe and i said to one of the coaches i want to get closer to him so i will be on television and he said dont worry about it kid
2928400 thats crazy and he said hes coming to the track to see how i go
2928401 he does such a good job in right field we hate to take him out of the lineup
2928402 at the same time we have other people swinging the bats well give him every opportunity
2928403 the only thing i see is that he is not taking as many pitches they may be throwing him more strikes
2928404 i was a little panicky at first me being the youngest and least experienced
2928405 alicia whipped me back in shape she said everything would be fine we cant change because of this theres nothing you can do
2928406 sam is almost like a sister to me the whole team kind of felt her pain and what she has gone through she was like youve got to take first man up on floor and gave us a lot of pep talks you could hear her cheering on every element
2928407 in international competition you never really know how the scores will go i wouldve liked to do a little better especially on bars
2928408 we knew bridget would come through when she had to
2928409 its a tough thing when one of us has an injury but the rest of us have confidence in each other
2928410 were all happy with the way we have responded to everything in these two weeks were able to endure put our best foot forward im sure we will do that in team finals

2928412 the girls parents took her to pals clinic in the locality on saturday evening pal gave her an injection and put her on a glucose drip soon after the 16 yearold started bleeding profusely from her nose and she died said amarnath jha a political worker who is helping the family
2928413 pals clinic wasnt a registered one and we are investigating his medical qualifications it is a bailable offence but he has been remanded in police custody till august 14 said inspector ravindra sawant of the dahisar police station
2928414 the case is ideal for compensation under the kutumb arth sahaya yojna family financial support scheme for needy a state government run scheme
2928415 i am very excited that the president has come to our village because i have never in my life seen him face to face
2928416 this celebration is special for us in the village of ga motlatla and i want to thank the government for celebrating with us
2928417 after seeing celebrations of this nature it has convinced me that women are receiving the attention they deserve and are getting the opportunities they were denied in the past
2928418 this also shows how government has taken the empowerment of women very seriously and it is up to our children to utilise all these opportunities
2928419 i have never seen president thabo mbeki and the north west premier edna molewa before
2928420 i hope to see them today and i do have a feeling that after their visit our lives as young women of this village will change
2928421 but for us it is a big deal because we dont normally get the opportunity to be exposed to senior government officials
2928422 i am very excited to be here to celebrate womens day in this manner and also to see president mbeki for the first time
2928423 i would be a lot happier if i can get the opportunity to shake his hand
2928424 the dialogue will be completed within a period of two weeks from the date of signing of this mou

2928426 but the gap between the married and never married is closing especially for men
2928427 politicians and scholars continue to debate the value of marriage for americans
2928428 with some going so far as to establish social programs and policies to encourage marriage among those social groups less inclined to marry particularly the poor and minorities
2928429 encouraging marriage in order to promote health may be misguided
2928430 it hurt to lose the wimbledon final and then the speculation starts about me losing my number one ranking but nobody would be talking about that if i had won a few more points at wimbledon
2928431 its an opportunity that doesnt come along too often its an honor to be asked
2928432 without banging my own drum too much id say the improvement is huge
2928433 one of the main reasons is the fitness with mark laws weve raised the bar
2928434 if two months ago we would have played canada im certain we would have lost the game
2928435 its an eye in the sky thing if need be i call and make a suggestion
2928436 coaching is mostly demonstrating a picture paints a thousand words kind of thing
2928437 he has brought some new concepts in training and in the match
2928438 its an opportunity that doesnt come along too often its an honor to be asked
2928439 without banging my own drum too much id say the improvement is huge
2928440 one of the main reasons is the fitness with mark laws weve raised the bar
2928441 if two months ago we would have played canada im certain we would have lost the game

2928443 coaching is mostly demonstrating a picture paints a thousand words kind of thing
2928444 he has brought some new concepts in training and in the match
2928445 i cant believe we dont win a race in three or four weeks and were in a slump
2928446 walk graduation and get that ba degree in my hands
2928447 for foreign funds equity is definitely no longer the preferred asset class
2928448 they are quite wary of it and indian ipos do not fit their strategy now
2928449 it all depends on market sentiment there is clearly a flavour for public sector stocks but pricing is the key
2928450 will a large ipo be subscribed yes but the question will be is there anything left on the table for investors to make money after the listing
2928451 there is a wariness towards taking fresh positions in indian offerings
2928452 h nej nej det r inte dig jag skriver om allting handlar inte om dig vet du
2928453 the gt r is incredible value for money the people who can afford the gt r arent feeling the credit crunch
2928454 once you get that first job it just flows but for overseas students it is really hard to know where to start
2928455 people here dont care about what you have done back home they only look at australian work experience and most students who have just arrived from overseas have no contacts and dont know the culture or the companies
2928456 i have been telling each and every person i know that there are so many opportunities at uq business school instead of wasting time looking outside they should take advantage of what is on offer and if they dont know what is available they should ask
2928457 i always wanted to work as a business analyst so getting a starting role through tuscon was a good step for me
2928458 tuscon not only made use of the skills i already had but allowed me to put into practice what i was learning through my mba and just as importantly for me it gave me valuable credit towards gaining my permanent residency in australia
2928459 we help businesses reap the benefits offered by these highly skilled individuals without the hassle of red tape usually associated with employing both local and international staff
2928460 taking part in and winning the enterprize competition has helped me develop it widened my network of contacts and because people know about enterprize it brings you to the notice of employers it gives you an edge
2928461 abhishek was no doubt a valuable member of our enterprize team and everyone recognized his contribution to our win which was why in the end we offered him a permanent position with us
2928462 for us enterprize not only provided welcome capital and exposure but a valued employee
2928463 people say its very difficult to manage all these activities with the time commitment to postgraduate studies but its all about time management manage it like you manage your money
2928464 the god who holds you over the pit of hell much as one holds a spider or some loathsome insect over the flame abhors you and is dreadfully provoked
2928465 we had a second crew for about a month in january to see if there was a call volume for it
2928466 from the feedback we got from the first responders they could see a dramatic change
2928467 has a collection rate of 3 percent over the national average
2928468 we would look at a 200 000 or 300 000 a year increase in revenue
2928469 we applied last year and theres 13 million dollars still out there but there were 2 500 applicants
2928470 my wife and i will stay in england where democracy is more important
2928471 what happened to me and my family and my close relations resulted from efforts to get rid of me from politics
2928472 curbs seems a bit more relaxed and he most definitely has the backing of the players
2928473 i can understand why he is under criticism hes taken a job at a football club who had a huge financial injection
2928474 people expected big things at this place and so far those massive things have not been delivered
2928475 we need an all purpose building to serve the same things that it did for 55 or 60 years in our community
2928476 we feel without that our history is being cut short
2928477 i dont know really if the city ought to have the ability to heat food in every building we have
2928478 ovens especially food preparation is a problem its messy its hard to clean up after and food and gymnasiums and people eating on gymnasium floors is probably not real conducive
2928479 we were ushered across the street and told our families would be arrested
2928480 run us over here to these places that are already overbooked and overcrowded
2928481 its a hard sell when you tear down whats considered to be a landmark in the african american community
2928482 its an even harder sell when you tear it down and dont replace it with exactly what it once was
2928483 weve made progress in america and i think as a sign of our progress we take advantage of the things our forefathers fought for
2928484 i think having similar buildings within 100 yards of each other is not good business on behalf of the city but im going to talk to our folks talk to city commissioners and meet with lynn ray and see if we cant get something that will make them happy
2928485 i would hate to think it was a black and white issue because this new sanders center is going to be open to the entire city of texas city
2928486 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2928487 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2928488 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2928489 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2928490 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2928491 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2928492 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2928493 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2928494 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2928495 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2928496 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2928497 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2928498 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2928499 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2928500 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2928501 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2928502 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2928503 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2928504 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2928505 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2928506 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2928507 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2928508 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2928509 we would go out to heards lane to have picnics
2928510 ive asked la marque to give up the road in their extraterritorial jurisdiction
2928511 but they voted against it the road has no value its a state right of way were not planning on building a hotel on it
2928512 i sat here monday before the storm and clocked one at 83 mph one at 76 mph and another at 90 mph
2928513 early in the mornings and late in the evenings its like a racetrack
2928514 the city council felt like it was something they didnt want to relinquish
2928515 i would have to send our reserve officers to court and they work other jobs during the day
2928516 we are the only museum in this region of texas to host this exhibit
2928517 people in the galveston area should not miss this opportunity to see it and to participate by sharing their stories
2928518 ive done lots of different sports and this is by far the most fun
2928519 when the wind is calm its like sitting on a cloud on your front porch at 3 000 feet you can see everything

2928532 ive liked her music from the first time i heard it
2928533 i never thought id get a chance to see her in my hometown
2928534 we came for bonnie but there were a lot of great acts
2928535 you see some of the older guys playing like that but hes so young its hard to believe he has that kind of control
2928536 i first saw him when he was 13 or 14 years old just after he was discovered by jeff healey at a club in toronto ive watched him evolve and he just gets better and better
2928537 its great to have hall of famers like raitt but its also great because it gives independent artists an opportunity to show they can hold their own onstage
2928538 see what we can do in november to help this part of the world
2928539 we wanted to build the festival into one of the strongest in atlantic canada
2928540 weve done that by bringing in top acts but still leaving room for atlantic canadian performers
2928541 its almost unheard of summer doesnt usually afford films that much of a wide open playing field
2928542 it has taken on a life of its own and in doing so got so much positive press and word of mouth that older audiences who normally dont rush out to see movies or maybe only see two three movies a year are coming out in large numbers
2928543 its a question of weve been reading about this for three four weeks now
2928544 quite frankly its nice to know that everything else is still kind of doing some business
2928545 were so very satisfied to be at 40 million plus after five days you couldnt ask for more
2928546 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2928547 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2928548 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
2928549 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2928550 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins
2928551 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of cheques with our show making fun of christians
2928552 marriages at least in the beginning take three people the third provides the glue
2928553 i have to park where its level or my dog cant get out
2928554 seriously the city picks them up sometimes i know where they put them i could check if you want
2928555 hes played at a tremendous level and i think hes still got a lot of rubber left on the tires
2928556 it was the first time hes played in two years he started off the game not quite getting where he was supposed to be and stuff like that which youd expect thats whats going to happen you have to have patience with those guys
2928557 la guerra de las galaxias la guerra de los clones
2928558 it could be a dangerous one as far as time we cant fool around too many days its getting to crunch time and weve got to go out there with all the ammo weve got
2928559 i tried to play through it but its aggravating a little bit now
2928560 they put me on some meds and hopefully we can get it taken care of so i can get back out there
2928561 i got a little treatment on it and thought it was going to go away but its flaring up i dont want to be out there have anybody hit a ball to me and i cant throw anybody out
2928562 thats not helping the team we need to win ballgames right now i dont want to go out there and hurt the team
2928563 it might have been affecting him swinging the bat a little bit

2928588 the conservative leaders decision to discuss openly the tories plans for taking over from labour risks leaving him vulnerable to accusations of hubris but mr cameron wants to win over the sizeable minority of voters whom polls suggest are not yet convinced his party is competent and ready to assume power
2928589 this is further evidence that the government is slowly strangling the a level gordon brown has consistently refused to secure the future as a qualification beyond 2013 ed balls is actively trying to subvert the a level by using diplomas as a way of undermining the gold standard qualification instead of concentrating on making the diploma a top flight vocational exam
2928590 the cost of those things that are essential to life fuel food and property is going to be the big political issue of the next decade but that does not mean that government should become even more involved in the provision of them in tough economic times what it should be doing is protecting the consumer and keeping its own charges to a minimum when politicians take an active hand in delivering the goods you can be sure that it will end up in your pocket
2928591 gordon browns economic recovery plans took a farcical twist as a senior civil servant was overheard discussing secret proposals to give families a one off windfall of up to 150 towards their winter fuel bills

2928601 gt mobile advertising supercharge your brand in the exploding wireless market by chetan sharma joe herzog and victor melfi
2928602 its like reading the index of a book rather than the book itself
2928603 some of this is early but in the next two to five years mobile is going to surge forward
2928604 as publishers were going to have to get our heads around exactly what is the right type of content to serve up to our users through various mobile devices i dont believe its a replica of the web i believe that well have to develop specific content and display it in the right way
2928605 true mobile advertising does not exist today what we are referring to is advertising on mobile when mobile advertising combines user profiling location and communication with unique mobile inventory the industry can justify charging a premium rate over existing immeasurable advertising channels
2928606 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2928607 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2928608 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2928609 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2928610 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2928611 america is like a healthy body and its resistance is threefold its patriotism its morality and its spiritual life if we can undermine these three areas america will collapse from within

2928618 no free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms the strongest reason for people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is as a last resort to protect themselves against tyranny in government
2928619 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2928620 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2928621 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2928622 whats missing is a positive compelling vision that ordinary people can buy into
2928623 we were all surprised at how game theoretic it is
2928624 we made a copy of the web and indexed it and we thought it reflected of web now we understand that we are in co evolution when we make a move the web changes and when web changes we do optimizers look at what we do and we look at what they do and web moves in different directions because of the interaction between them we hadnt expected that

2928633 i told him well go in my office and close the door he showed me up on the field and thats not done
2928634 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2928635 if your understanding is that neighbor c took the dog then you really should ask her not me where it is
2928636 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2928637 it was a magical and memorable spectacle and a great way to start the beijing olympics
2928638 they only planned on a week there which is a bit unusual as they still have some time together before he continues military training
2928639 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2928640 this is an isolated incident that had nothing to do with anything other than what can happen in any big city around the world if it had been some other random tourist we wouldnt even know anything about it maybe
2928641 so of course she got on the plane anyway and ill be happy to have them here you know youve just got to live your life you cant live in fear or anger about what happened
2928642 bad things happen in fort wayne ind where were from every day but we still go to coney island downtown we still go get gas still go to wal mart thats how you kind of have to live your life
2928643 they have told us not to do anything like that
2928644 you know at the olympics it could be anything it could be because you guys want an interview it could be a problem with tickets or logistics or practices we didnt know not until we got our therapy done and whatnot and saw the usoc people show up and the head of usa volleyball we knew something was wrong
2928645 we had lots of questions being only a couple hours since the incident they didnt have a lot of answers thats where most of the frustration came in were trying to make decisions in the next six hours people are supposed to fly here should we tell them to come not come was it something related to usa athletes or usa volleyball or a random act of violence which we now know obviously it was
2928646 we have no reason to believe that the assailant targeted the victims as american citizens
2928647 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2928648 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2928649 the less you pull out the fewer problems you have
2928650 its just going to flow into the atlantic and get salty anyway

2928654 all it takes is one pitch one swing one at bat to get going
2928655 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2928656 we looked at it as a way to better define our content and to improve our traffic
2928657 you know love dont mean nothing really im not a fan of love people fall in and out of love every day let the lights go off and see how much they love you dont let anything be on that table at 5 oclock in the evening and see how much she loves you let that car keep breaking down and see how much she loves you i really believe out of 27 years of being with my wife that we went through that transition that we like each other and i think thats the most important thing i truly like her shes my friend you know and i wouldnt trade her for nothing in the world
2928658 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2928659 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others
2928660 never offered never considered no one even thought about it no one even mentioned it
2928661 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2928662 i talked to my wife for an hour yesterday because they had not left the states yet to come here
2928663 we talked about whether they should come or not shes a lot stronger than i am so she got on the plane anyway with the kids and ill be happy to have them here because you just have to live your life you cant live in fear or anger about what happened
2928664 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely

2928674 we send a special thank you to the people of beijing the people of new zealand and of course the people of america we have been lifted up by the outpouring of support and love weve received from around the world
2928675 the long list of people who have offered their assistance kind words and prayers to us has been incredible
2928676 this letter cannot do justice in acknowledging the love and support weve felt
2928677 he gave us a little bit of reassurance to move on
2928678 to try to focus on what we came here to do weve all invested so much of our lives as he has it was great to hear his voice we just have to try to trust what he says
2928679 the best thing way we can honor them at this juncture is the only thing that we can do
2928680 and thats to go out and compete every day and play hard every day and enjoy and love the game of volleyball

2928697 after a while and the resistance a desire built up in me to work in material of waste and softness something yielding with its only message a collection of lines imprinted like a friendly joke a silent discussion of their history exposed by their new shapes labored commonly with happiness boxes

2928722 south east asia has plummeted to levels it took europe 150 years to reach in just 30 years
2928723 the span of fertility across countries has never been wider
2928724 both extremes cause their own problems if europe continues at 1 5 the population will halve every 65 years if africa continues with half its population under 15 it will continue to consume more than it produces making it harder to escape from poverty and illiteracy
2928725 people are very bad at calculating survival probabilities twenty years ago fertility started to decline in nepal and bangladesh when they were still poor korea wasnt rich when fertility declined by contrast the gulf oil states continued with high birthrates long after they got huge wealth
2928726 in africa most women work in agriculture around the home
2928727 but in bangladesh women get out and meet other women at work who may be using contraception getting outside the home fixes a new social norm prosperity and fertility are interlinked in a chicken and egg way
2928728 food sex and procreation are core elements of humanity and changes to them are often met with fierce hostility
2928729 in my view the evidence is that there is something intrinsic to the culture its there in the rich muslim states in the gulf in saudi arabia and in the muslim provinces of the former soviet union it is perhaps bound up with the status of women
2928730 not just in catholic spain and italy but in orthodox greece the strong traditions are not boosting fertility rate as many might suppose

2928858 georgia made the mistake of provoking the bear and that bear has international legitimacy from the un to defend sossetia and now georgia has given russia the excuse to try and capitalize on the situation and gain control of the oil pipelines
2928859 oh the people that started fighting after there cities were being bombed by the georgians
2928860 gee i wish something would happen so that the people would forget about iraq

2928865 in all my time ive only known three goose that came to grief
2928866 thats not to say youre guaranteed 100 per cent no accidents theres always murphys law you know
2928867 my specialty is flying in the mountains doing some of the windy horrible things that might scare a lot of other people off
2928868 the engine came apart and i ended up in the trees and ended up walking home
2928869 that machine had never been within 50 miles of the ocean ever
2928870 people going beyond their capability and pushing the airplane beyond their capability
2928871 weather is one of the biggest things and get home itis youre in a hurry to get home so you push a little bit
2928872 you want to look like the macho hero so you say aw i can do it somebody else did it so i should be able to thats not always true
2928873 were all asked that but this is my 33rd year of flying i can say no i wont pick you up there ill pick you up over here
2928874 ive been in the business a long time and ive got a lot of friends that arent here any more trying to be heroes
2928875 it actually pulled out of it without the rotors even turning fast enough
2928876 weve had countless calls from homeowners interested in renting out their properties
2928877 but many are waiting in the expectation that they will get more money nearer the games
2928878 most properties in vancouver are sitting at the 400 per bedroom per night rate
2928879 which seems to me a level which may prove comparable to hotel rates
2928880 there are 75 000 hotel rooms and an estimated 300 000 visitors
2928881 anywhere along the skytrain or the rail lines as far out as abbotsford and mission which involve a journey time of a little more than an hour as long as the price is flexible and reasonable may be good options for families on a budget
2928882 i expect visitors to start locking in their bookings soon after beijing is over
2928883 i didnt think my wife would be keen but when we saw we could charge 30 000 she figured it might just be worth it
2928884 a relative of a friend answered the door to their place in whistler and someone offered them 35 000 on the spot
2928885 its a huge inconvenience for us to move out of our home and we should be properly compensated
2928886 but i started talking to other people in whistler about why they werent putting their properties up for rent and they were saying they didnt want to miss the once in a lifetime opportunity of being part of the olympics
2928887 we are seven adults and a five month old baby this time
2928888 we have rented a condo three kilometres from the main stadium and on a subway line for 4 000 the owner is picking us up from the airport buying a car seat for my baby granddaughter and giving us all brand new sheets and towels
2928889 i think 500 per night is a reasonable price for us
2928890 the rapid real estate price rise means that many people are looking for ways to help their mortgage
2928891 theyre not interested in making sure the guests really enjoy their stay its not about being an ambassador for vancouver
2928892 but i can tell you it is very very high
2928893 whether i provide the service or they dry hire the room the fee is the same
2928894 i built in wages and gratuity compensation for my staff and an expectation that whoever is here will break every glass and plate in the place the room will need repainting half the booths will be repaired
2928895 rather than book out an entire restaurant for the duration of the games i would rotate smaller groups providing their vips with a variety of meal options and we can still service our regular customers
2928896 i cant tell you how moved i am by this piece of fruit
2928897 im planning to use it to grow a bunch of soccer balls in my backyard
2928898 i will always carry with me the image of our canadian team entering the stadium behind kayaker adam van koeverden
2928899 its three times the size of stanley park and its absolutely beautiful it really takes your breath away
2928900 i believe the most significant reason is the difference in profile before they get to the olympics
2928901 gold medals typically get some awareness and attention in canada
2928902 it doesnt mean its a bag of riches for them that is for very few athletes in this country
2928903 ive seen deals that bring maybe 50 to 100 per cent more dollars to the winter athletes
2928904 its a challenge for a lot of the summer olympians
2928905 how many people are kayakers how many are trampolinists all the summer disciplines are difficult to identify with
2928906 and i suspect that if they had a chance to increase budgets they would be spending more in vancouver not splitting it
2928907 a lot of successful olympians havent cashed in to the degree they should have
2928908 but making it happen in another olympiad helps that process
2928909 he has a history of success hes currently on top of his game and definitely articulate
2928910 he should emerge as one of the stars of the games
2928911 unless we have some indication of where it might have happened it makes it pretty difficult for us to get in there
2928912 the high cost of fuel the higher cost of food could be affecting peoples disposable income people have less money to donate
2928913 a lot of our clientele are single parent families and seniors with fixed incomes
2928914 id imagine if the cost of food is going up the cost of transportation is going up that could definitely propel people into food bank reliance
2928915 fuel is a piece of food banks budgets in terms of trying to acquire and share the food and as transportation costs go up that is putting an additional squeeze on their resources that we havent seen in previous years
2928916 hunger is a significant issue in this country which is sad given the fact that we live in such a wealthy country
2928917 it really takes the effort of all of us the charitable community is there companies are there helping to support and we definitely need government support as well
2928918 its not food prices that are making people fall over the brink
2928919 for us its a fun thing the reason why scientists are here is that this is exactly what they do for work but they are doing for the love of biology and its fun beer and pizza is a big part of it
2928920 it just shows how little we know our native biology if we go across different ecosystems we find more things
2928921 but if we dont see them we dont count them no one has seen a cougar and i dont think anyone has seen a marmot this year
2928922 its pretty dirty work but its incredible to educate the public and get everyone down here especially the kids
2928923 but its also good to create baselines of the animal species of the area
2928924 we call them squirrel food we scratched back the forest floor a little bit and found them in short time
2928925 we started whistler naturalists about 10 years ago and it became apparent at the start that we really didnt know what species were here you cant conserve a species and you cant educate people about it until you know what is here
2928926 were adding to it every year some are species like lichen and mushrooms which are interesting to specialists though maybe not the general public but then we found the red legged frog last year for the first time and thats a species at risk and that can lead to conservation action
2928927 they are experts in one area of insect study so an entomologist who knows about butterflies will not know much about spiders and so on
2928928 we have 63 mammals on the overall list and weve never had homo sapiens on it so of course we added them so now theres 64
2928929 its fantastic that they are finally doing more to understand the environment and understand how sensitive it is here
2928930 young people know it is closing and they do not want to go there
2928931 we will support those patients as long as we are open
2928932 were going to do the very best that we can for them
2928933 if youre moving a hundred beds out thats several millions of dollars if there is a delay in the bed openings it creates some of that surplus
2928934 so when we can we use those surpluses for a variety of purposes
2928935 its the same in other areas were a closing facility and people are moving to other places to work the whole recruitment issue continues to be a struggle for us were working actively to solve that
2928936 make british columbia the best educated most literate jurisdiction on the continent

2928963 failed to inform you that a trip to los altos would cost meter and a half which didnt really matter because kolands company was covering your travel expenses anyway and you probably only cared about it because your dad made you feel like a pushover afterward and your mom told the driver that you were an attorney and wouldnt let him get away with this
2928964 we have one or two options were looking at and its possible well sign someone this week the strikers position is something thats been pressing since the end of last season but now there is some light at the end of the tunnel there is nothing at all to say about berbatov were looking at options elsewhere wed like to add to our squad and were making moves in that direction were trying theres an issue with scoring goals at the moment but if youre making as many chances as we are we shouldnt worry about it because players will come back and we will eventually add to the squad
2928965 this is not about questioning the managers judgment or the ability of a particular player the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so it is obviously the selling clubs prerogative to put whatever price they want on the player on this occasion liverpool think the price quoted is too high
2928966 take the man with 42 goals last season out the team and remove wayne rooney too and this is still united but not as we remember the european champions
2928967 berbatov remains the primary target spurs are seeking around 30m but would rather sell him to another club though relations will have to improve between two clubs before a deal could be thrashed out with that in mind and perhaps to prompt spurs into relaxing their stance ferguson claimed he may look elsewhere reports yesterday linked him with a move for thierry henry now at barcelona
2928968 alex ferguson has taunted spurs by refusing to rule out a move for former arsenal ace thierry henry
2928969 whether reports of uniteds apparent interest in henry are merely intended to make tottenham sweat especially because the north london club are likely to need the money from berbatov to sign another striker is unclear but ferguson has long been an admirer of the barcelona forward
2928970 that united were destined to win yesterday was never really in doubt taking it to penalties was portsmouths only half prospect of stealing the trophy however as the chances came and went with a rapidity which bore testament to uniteds intelligence as much as portsmouths defensive limitation there was the feeling dimitar berbatovs asking price was probably rising in tandem
2928971 it came down quite simply to goals on their way to their 13th community shield victory manchester united were slick in their passing lively in their movement and dominant in every department over portsmouth not only that they won 10 corners to their opponents one they clipped the bar and they demanded the very best of david james their problem was that they failed to express their advantage in goals which is the commodity in which ronaldo deals most effectively take the man with 42 goals last season out the team and remove wayne rooney too and this is still united but not as we remember the european champions yes it might only have been the community shield game but in many respects it told us a great deal about united
2928972 united can afford to miss chances in the community shield they could even have afforded to miss their penalties in the grand scheme of things but a finisher might make the difference to the fine margins that operate in the premier league missed chances could prove the difference between a good start and a great start which is why ferguson made his priority clear he does not want to offer the slightest piece of daylight to his closest rivals from day one it is not in his nature
2928973 so if ronaldo had fulfilled his dream with a move to spain the obvious successor would probably have been asked to fill the void the situation now of course isnt quite so extreme much to the relief of everyone concerned maybe even nani who showed in his second community shield outing that while he possesses bags of skill he isnt quite ready to fill the boots of his compatriot very much like ronaldo in fact during his early days a propensity to overdramatise sometimes let nani down clearly 12 months under fergusons guidance hasnt been enough to iron out some of the less endearing aspects of the lads game
2928974 would croouch link up well with jermain defoe could the portsmouth pair trouble manchester uniteds usually imperturbable defence should fabio capello who was in attendance at wembley pick them for the friendly against the czech republic later this month sadly for the forwards the only answers which could be expressed with any real honesty after the final whistle here were no no and no when defoe scored for portsmouth in the penalty shoot out it represented the first time either he or crouch had troubled edwin van der sar in the united goal
2928975 harry redknapp faces sizeable task trying not to typecast crouch and defoe
2928976 the notion that a little and large double act is a formula for success may owe more to fond memories of laurel and hardy and morecambe and wise than the realities of modern football jermain defoe and peter crouch played together for portsmouth in a significant match for the first time yesterday and their most assured piece of link up play came when they stood in the centre circle and kicked off in the second half
2928977 i saw arsenal they have a good team but have a small group of experienced players the second group is full of boys they have talent but maybe arsenal are without the depth needed to win the title
2928978 rafa benitezs anger at the collapse of gareth barrys proposed move to anfield shows little sign of subsiding despite attempts to defuse his latest fall out with the clubs hierarchy liverpool manager benitez is still fuming at the u turn by owners george gillett and tom hicks who have refused to sanction an 18million deal a week after agreeing to it
2928979 keegan is the right manager to reenergise the club but why is there distance between him and the acquisition department does that really play to his strengths are keegan and dennis wise the executive director football pulling in the same direction who is making the decisions why has footballs greatest communicator not been encouraged to deliver a more upbeat message injuries are already a concern is there momentum and in which direction is it propelling the club
2928980 everton have agreed a deal with cska moscow for v gner love the brazil striker who is expected to join on a season long loan with a view to a permanent 13 million move that would smash the clubs transfer record loves arrival will not necessarily signal the end of moyess interest in diego milito the real zaragoza and argentina striker st phane mbia is also expected to arrive as a replacement for lee carsley after the french club accepted a 6 million bid alan smith should sign from newcastle united for about 2 million this week despite kevin keegan the manager insisting the opposite yesterday evertons spending could reach nearly 40 million if moyes succeeds in his efforts to sign jo o moutinho
2928981 im excited by whats ahead of us we have a group of players who are determined to be successful this year and we have just beaten milan in case you didnt notice i know which direction the club is going im trying to push things forward and trying to be successful that hasnt changed since i walked through the door we showed notice of intent with the players we have brought in already we have made significant investments and are looking to add players we are working to that end there is not that much of the window left but you can do business right until the last minute and that is what we will try and do
2928982 manchester city owner thaksin shinawatra was back in london last night after refusing to return to thailand to face trial on corruption charges further harming his chances of ever releasing 800million of frozen assets in his home country with city manager mark hughes desperate for funds to strengthen his squad thaksins refusal to head to bangkok from beijing yesterday could have drastic knock on effects for the new eastlands boss
2928983 manchester city are on the verge of meltdown with boss mark hughes facing the sale of more stars by owner thaksin shinawatra this week hughes is already fuming about vedran corlukas move to tottenham and only found out that stephen ireland was being sold behind his back hours before the 1 0 win ac milan on saturday when he was told the news by the media midfield schemer ireland was advised by senior official paul aldridge not to play in case he picked up an injury and would miss out on a move to sunderland with bolton also interested in him
2928984 when bill kenwright the everton chairman spoke of needing the wealth of a billionaire to make his team truly competitive he nailed the truth about the premier league what clubs such as tottenham hotspur and aston villa aspire to costs more than just about any owner is prepared to gamble it took roman abramovichs wealth to make chelsea a fixture at the top and even if arsenal or liverpool look vulnerable to some eyes what hope is there that a team eyeing their status can maintain the level of investment needed to avoid being a flash in the plan like everton in fourth tottenham for all their ambition still lose their best players michael carrick robbie keane and maybe dimitar berbatov to the bigger clubs villa would be without gareth barry now if liverpool could get their act together

2929007 knee and body are fine i pulled up ok after the game on the weekend so hopefully i can get through training this week
2929008 im very comfortable its probably the best ive felt game wise and each week is getting better so i cant wait to get out there soon
2929009 ive been told theres no more things i can do to my knee its not going to get any worse
2929010 the only main thing is to make sure i get my hammies and quadies right
2929011 if i run out there and tear a hammy or quady i miss a couple of weeks anyway so if i get that strengthened up ill be fine and ive been doing that for the last eight weeks and its getting better each week
2929012 im squatting heavier each time i do it so its a positive sign
2929013 we left this morning and four women were going to the doctor and one was going shopping in al wajihiyah
2929014 coalition troops called in close air support to engage the militants hiding in the structure they did not have knowledge of non combatants in the buildings at that time
2929015 survivors reported that coalition aircraft dropped a bomb on the enemy position which killed eight of the civilians
2929016 an anonymous eyewitness told coalition forces that the civilians tried to escape the compound but the militants beat them and refused to let them leave
2929017 innocent civilians homes taking them by force to attack afghan and coalition forces
2929018 if civilians get killed during these attacks the responsibility falls on the taliban and their terrorist sponsors
2929019 all wins are important but i suppose since the origin series weve been labouring a little bit at some stages in some games
2929020 we think theres some areas of our game we can improve and well have to improve but there were some good signs to be able to play 80 minutes at that intensity against manly even though we probably didnt execute it as well as wed like
2929021 just from that game the other night i think we can improve with our attack
2929022 the origin series takes a lot out of some guys physically and takes a lot out of some guys mentally so even during and after the origin series theres usually some signs there that weve had nine or 10 players who havent been at their best
2929023 we havent been at our best but theyve still found a way to win most of those games
2929024 a lot of its mental especially this time of the year but were sort of concentrating a little bit more on our physical stuff at the moment because we gave the origin players a whole heap of rest
2929025 were probably trying to build that up a little bit at the moment so thats one of our focuses
2929026 we think theyre fresh enough now for us to lift their training load and hopefully that will help us as well
2929027 theres probably a couple there that might be a little bit of a concern for this week they didnt train today
2929028 last time the surface wasnt up to the standard that wed hoped but were satisfied now and have no issue with it
2929029 im saying theyre talking to me im not talking to them im not ringing them up and i dont talk to them for very long
2929030 thats the reality of football i know for certain some of the players whove left our club in the past have spoken long and hard with coaches at other club
2929031 but i guarantee were not lying down and were in the game and well be in the game whether its recruiting for trading or uncontracted players well be in the game
2929032 thats up in the air whether thomson plays again we certainly have a view of where adam is and similar to nathan lonie and greg bentley last week toby thurstans we know what they can provide for the club and well continue to look at the others and if we need well pick them as well
2929033 we know where theyre at we need to consider how the others are and then make some choices
2929034 players argue when we win too and its only really highlighted when you lose
2929035 i suppose the tradition of the club here is you demand a lot from each other and i know over the years we won premiership after premiership wed argue with each other and demand a lot from each other and try to keep the standard up so im sure thats a lot of it and i suppose carlton arent used to that

2929049 it was something i would have expected probably 10 years ago when i was in my prime

2929060 you have to get focused and give it a go
2929061 but i guess thats the way things go sometimes the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
2929062 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2929063 were looking good were just going to keep it going
2929064 im really pleased with the canadian performances so far as many of us have gone lifetime best

2929091 there is a caesura between the two types of art but when you place them together and thats what weve done in this exhibition then it tells that there is a story there even if people are looking at life differently and the values are sometimes changed theres a whole continuity to the story

2929127 i enjoy being captain of liverpool football club its a role i relish
2929128 it helps my performances i try to go out on the pitch and lead by example to get glory and be successful in this game you have to make a lot of sacrifices perform under pressure and take an awful lot of responsibility on board
2929129 if you look at most successful teams they have at least one homegrown player were lucky here to have two myself and jamie carragher its a good link between the supporters and the team it also helps the other players realise what the club wants and to transmit the history of the club being local you have the responsibility to help foreign players settle and make sure theyre happy when youre in the dressing room before a big game they see your attitude and the way youre behaving so they get an idea how important it is to play football here
2929130 going in 3 0 down at half time there were a lot of sad faces in the dressing room it was my responsibility to try and lift the team to tell my team mates it wasnt over that goal gave us a little bit of hope a little bit of belief
2929131 it was a miracle being 3 0 down and coming back to 3 3 then extra time and penalties and the save from jerzy dudek late on in extra time then andrei shevchenko one of the best players ive ever played against missing a penalty it was a miracle
2929132 great memories memories ill never forget it was the best night of my footballing career so far id love nothing better than to go and achieve it again

2929204 theres wide variation in the development of kids some need deodorant earlier than others kids will make fun of them if they smell and they want to fit in
2929205 sometimes kids dont have access to the needed supplies but if the counselor is aware the school will often provide the items
2929206 parents can help by being supportive and having the supplies on hand
2929207 culture creates expectations a lot of the time and culture changes this is one reason kids are developing earlier than in previous years
2929208 girls ought to definitely wear a bra as soon as the nipples begin to show
2929209 parents should talk with and let their young person know they have supplies stashed in a drawer or somewhere for use when the time comes moms can assure daughters they will be there for them this eases some of the anxiety and embarrassment
2929210 parents can assure sons that wet dreams are a natural part of growing up and nothing to be ashamed of
2929211 wet dreams can occur as early as age 10 the time of experiencing wet dreams can be a good opportunity to talk about the responsibilities of sex parents still have control at that age and kids will still listen and respect what parents tell them
2929212 the appearance of acne is something that parents need to pay attention to

2929223 youll have to forgive me for being an eisenhower republican
2929224 i dont know how much you know about my grandfathers administration
2929225 but that administration stood for multilateral engagement balancing the budget
2929226 he has very little debt i just love it anybody who wants to make him out as this wide eyed liberal i just dont see any evidence for that not in the way he runs his campaign and this tells you a lot about how he can administer things how he manages things how he deals with situations
2929227 this race is very similar to the 1952 campaign that brought my grandfather to power
2929228 he was an outsider who was nominated by the republican party but it was not an easy process at all he was an outsider who threatened to shake up the party itself
2929229 it is this very weird moment where republicans are very divided
2929230 its accurate to say that you dont have a dominant set of ideas or a figure the party can really rally behind what you simply see are factions who arent forming to create a coherent vision
2929231 the 70s the great shift in american culture society and politics
2929232 youve seen this amazing united front by different factions that are much more at odds ideologically than the factions within the democratic party theyve all managed to put their feelings about one another aside to defeat a common enemy i dont think the fracturing youre seeing now will result in large numbers of republicans voting for obama but i do think youll see people willing to sit on their hands instead of work towards that common goal as they have in the past
2929233 both these parties have core constituencies that will support the party no matter what
2929234 even today george bush has a 28 percent approval rating there are cycles of american history where you see a real shift but i dont see a definitive change in party structure or alignment i see a national mood shift that gives the democrats and upper hand for the time being but if obamas elected both he and the party have to deliver
2929235 the thing we have to ask ourselves for this election is whether this is a small temporary change or permanent realignment
2929236 political parties change over decades to seize and capitalize on opportunities but what can happen whether youre a democrat or republican is you can wake up one morning and find yourself looking at a party whose standard bearer doesnt reflect the values that brought you to the party in the first place i can say that for this election im supporting barack obama because i think he will represent the future of america he is the future of america
2929237 my grandfather thought there were three things that comprised our national security one our ability to address our adversaries
2929238 by temperament and genetics i do recognize that were already there
2929239 but we have to understand that my grandfather a five star general understood that staying in korea wasnt a sustainable operation either and got the united states out of there
2929240 asking whether something is viable or not has nothing to do with patriotism
2929241 you can conclude youre damaging your long term national interests by holding the status quo one of the great expressions i grew up with as a child is perfect is the enemy of good we have to move forward in a good way because were never going to see a consensus on anything
2929242 for people who are being critical about barack obama talking about hope
2929243 i dont think they understand the first thing about american rhetoric and moving this country forward ronald reagan was not a success because he had people scared and frightened all the time he inspired thousands of people with hope when the cold war was stagnant and inflation was high and the country sour we now have another figure right now who has brought all sorts of people into the political process who has convinced a significant number of people that they were welcome on his team and has offered a crisp new chance to turn the page internationally

2929311 this particular air force exercise is important because india is included among some very important allies
2929312 this is definitely an extension of an arc that has been mapped out since 2000 and it really signifies that what india and the united states have is a strategic relationship
2929313 pyongyang through its state run news agency the korean central news agency has consistently and passionately criticized such ventures accusing the united states of harboring hostile intentions toward north korea
2929314 beijing would likely remain reticent about such training since it does not see itself as directly and imminently affected by such activities
2929315 we will learn how our allies operate in response to similar threats
2929316 it will allow us to build observations to eventually learn those lessons about what it takes to integrate talk fly with employ deploy and sustain air power with places like india korea and france

2929327 theyve banned sikh turbans and the wearing of christian crosses and the jewish star of david as well
2929328 the law is against exhibiting overt religious symbols in public france is a secular country and it has every right to do so what if a european woman appears in a mini skirt on zainab market you will say since you are an islamic republic you have the right to ban such attire in public wouldnt you i think they tolerate a lot more hijabs and turbans in their country than we can ever tolerate crosses shorts and skirts in ours

2929356 illness can signify the loss of ones plans and even dreams but most often people who live with invisible illness find a new purpose they would not have imagined under any other set of circumstances
2929357 i had always planned to work for a nonprofit doing something to help others but i never felt i was efficient or empathetic enough because i had not walked in the shoes of those i served now through my illness ministry and books on aspects of coping with illness i have the chance to use what i experience each day to reach out to others its my hope that they will also find hope despite their illness as they discover that new sense of purpose in the pain

2929386 this allows canada to establish its outer limits once and for all
2929387 that gives canada the exclusive rights to develop the natural resources on and below the seabed in that area
2929388 if we can demonstrate that the ridge is part of the north american continent the danes can use that information to show it is also part of greenland
2929389 they can use it to define their outer limits to the east and we can use it define outer limits to the west and we both benefit

2929397 program analysis estimates the non compliance rate to be higher on netfile returns vs the other filing methods
2929398 the participants demonstrated a perception that not having to attach receipts to the return creates a temptation for electronic filers to overstate their claims for deductions and credits
2929399 they believed they would not be caught as long as the overstatements were relatively small
2929400 software users do demonstrate a significantly higher non compliance rate as compared to non software users

2929463 i would like to congratulate paul henderson and concede that i am the opposition leader mr mills said
2929464 it appears the way the numbers have fallen means that the country liberals have done exceptional work but fallen short
2929465 i was quietly confident that if you speak in response to what you understand to be the needs of the community speak in terms that they can understand and provide them with a plan they will support you and i was always confident of that mr mills said
2929466 i believe that the result that has been achieved is an endorsement for that kind of politics

2929480 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2929481 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

2929487 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2929488 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2929489 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

2929493 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2929494 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2929495 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2929496 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2929497 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2929498 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2929499 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2929500 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2929501 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2929502 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2929503 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2929504 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2929505 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2929506 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2929507 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2929508 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2929509 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2929510 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2929511 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2929512 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2929513 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2929514 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2929515 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2929516 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2929517 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2929518 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2929519 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2929520 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2929521 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2929522 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

2929529 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2929530 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2929531 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2929532 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2929533 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2929534 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2929535 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2929536 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2929537 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2929538 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2929539 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2929540 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2929541 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2929542 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2929543 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2929544 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2929545 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2929546 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

2929549 epidural anaesthesia was associated with a small improvement in 30 day survival but this effect should be interpreted cautiously the estimate had borderline significance despite a large sample size its absolute magnitude was also small corresponding to a number needed to treat of 477 our study therefore does not provide compelling evidence that epidural anaesthesia improves postoperative survival nonetheless our results support the safety of perioperative epidural anaesthesia when used for indications other than improving survival for example improving postoperative pain relief or preventing postoperative lung complications
2929550 wijeysundera and colleagues point out that our focus should be on the proven benefits of epidural analgesia the most durable and clearly defined benefit of epidural analgesia is improved analgesia provision of effective analgesia is our core business it has substantial physiological and psychological benefits and is regarded as a fundamental human right pain after major surgery can be severe and we think that in many cases pain relief alone is an unambiguous clinical indication for postoperative epidural analgesia
2929551 epidural anaesthesia and survival after intermediate to high risk non cardiac surgery a population based cohort study
2929552 do we need to justify epidural analgesia beyond pain relief

2929555 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2929556 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2929557 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2929558 there is nothing else in a womans armoury that has as much power over her environment as the sensuality of her fragrance finding the ideal perfume that offers you everything youre looking for in one perfect little bottle is much harder than finding a striking pair of heels or a great dress perfume is much more personal

2929560 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2929561 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2929580 i know for myself that i cannot kiss a girl before marriage i only want to kiss my wife this is something that ive failed at more than once but that personal tailor made conviction from god remains i cannot do this i should not want to do this and through his help i will continue to not do this i wonder while it is perhaps not the honorable route everyone need take why does my extreme as it ends up being by default seem so far from what others say is okay for them to take part in kissing making out etc i wonder if i am just seeing to a very specific god spun conviction upon my heart for my life or are other people just fudging on what was once pursued to be application of biblical truth only to end in negotiation into something not entirely truth or is the truth of everything somewhere in the middle of all our worlds all i can say is that right now for me i must hold to what god has impressed me to do but i still do wonder and worry are others taking an alternative path to relationships filled with fast track and short cut that miss out on the courtly love approaches of old the lessons found in antiquity from those who have gone before us and in my opinion interpreted applied and surrendered to gods commands in ways that weve only negotiated with i wonder if weve forgotten all about our hearts motivation of application of biblical truth and exchanged it entirely or worse subtly allowed it to mingle with negotiation of such truth all that time between being down on two knees and perhaps just getting down on one one day seem chasms apart with impossible in the air if not for gods intentions to be remembered and devoured right now

2929648 this is a very valuable contribution to the history of crime and criminal justice geltner demonstrates contrary to the claims of modern historians that the prison a s a punitive institution was born in the later middle ages and shows contrary to the claims of medieval historians that prisons were not hellholes there is no equivalent study of italian medieval prisons
2929649 a most welcome addition to what has been a neglected field of medieval legal and social history geltner argues very persuasively that imprisonment was an important phenomenon in medieval italian cities the medieval prison should appeal to a fairly broad audience outside the field of medieval history

2929673 there are two factors at play the strengthening of the dollar and the military conflict
2929674 we dont want to get into moral issues at this point
2929675 we are bringing them here to talk about the election and to talk about elizabeths battle with cancer and that to us was more than enough to captivate an audience
2929676 hes a public figure so he needs to give us more information about the case
2929677 i dont think that his personal life should be anyone elses business hopefully no one brings it up because his wife is going to be there and its going to be uncomfortable for her
2929678 i knew about the salem witch trials because i have identified with those witches a time or two
2929679 i think the question goes more to the speaker than to the college
2929680 the college booked senator edwards because hes high profile it didnt book him based on his moral standing
2929681 the excitement of it the anxiousness of it the anticipation was just crazy im just glad its out of the way now now we can settle back in and really focus on our next opponents the game was just over the top
2929682 he basically came up to us and said im here to support you
2929683 this is a personal olympics for me everyone is proud it felt great all the flags and people were cheering

2929690 bob was a really good friend of mine and he made a wonderful contribution to the entire del rio community particularly with the military affairs committee and his incredible support of the pilots classes at laughlin air force base he was just a tremendous supporter of del rio and sacred heart parish
2929691 this is our duty this is our honor this is our privilege
2929692 he was a wonderful man thats all i can say and a lot of people are going to miss him
2929693 i guess its one of those things you dont know when it happens or when it gets started but the happiness and rewards it brings to you always give a special lift
2929694 there are many people we meet in our lives and some make more of a lasting impression than others only few make lasting impressions on our minds and hearts it is these friends that truly leave a vacancy not only in our own lives but those in our community i remember bobs smiling face every time we entered avantis and he always sat down with us as if we were at the family dinner table and had a story to tell he usually talked so fast and had so much on his mind you rarely had the opportunity to voice your own opinion i would like to think that if it differed from bobs he would most likely tell you about that too
2929695 he took a chance when going into business here but had faith in our community and grabbed the bull by the horns encompassing that faith he accomplished a task not many can boast of he put del rio on the map receiving the award and prestige of being one of the top ten italian restaurants in texas what an accomplishment he believed in shopping del rio when possible and supported our business when he could
2929696 say have you tried this its a great new red that just came in
2929697 bob michelini has been a good friend to me though technically we are competitors
2929698 bob was always my biggest fan giving me words of encouragement when i was down and making me feel better after visiting him i considered him a mentor always willing to lend advice eager to help in any way possible yet teaching by example the thing ive learned most about watching bob work is to have passion love what you are doing and do it with heart these are the things i will always strive to do in my own restaurant and if im successful bob can take credit for it bob created something unique in del rio a place where everybody feels welcome enjoys good food friendly conversation and if they are lucky got to spend a few priceless moments with bob thank you

2929715 there is a continuation of dictatorship in managing thai politics which is followed by interference in the justice system
2929716 he is certainly going to use his foreign base to influence thailands domestic politics it is going to be a very long story and this is certainly not the end

2929722 just doesnt work very well in certain industries as amply demonstrated by our airline experience in my view its time to acknowledge that airlines look and are more like utilities than ordinary businesses
2929723 deeply offensive to those who cling to the belief that the markets can solve everything
2929724 that an industry with large fixed or common costs will be unsustainable as competition drives prices to levels that dont allow the common costs to be recovered
2929725 wouldnt affect the price of oil or the fragility of the economy
2929726 will take time perhaps a lot of time to fix in the meantime to adapt to those realities the industry will need just the kind of innovation and flexibility that regulation is designed to impede
2929727 we are given no other recourse but to beg the legislature to please help us help our school children were just waiting for the funding source from the legislature and the passage of this bill once that is immediately addressed we will be forwarding our payment plan to defense logistics as well as to usda in san francisco

2929742 the review panel will now also look at these additional patients dr sherbon said
2929743 preliminary information indicates a number of these patients received only a handful of treatments on the affected machine and the majority of their treatments on other machines
2929744 the outcome of the independent review will be made public and i will carefully consider any recommendations that come from the review he said
2929745 the hospital will continue to work with all patients who have received treatment on this machine including going through their treatment with their oncologist or providing further information
2929746 i would like to congratulate paul henderson and concede that i am the opposition leader mr mills said
2929747 it appears the way the numbers have fallen means that the country liberals have done exceptional work but fallen short
2929748 i was quietly confident that if you speak in response to what you understand to be the needs of the community speak in terms that they can understand and provide them with a plan they will support you and i was always confident of that mr mills said
2929749 i believe that the result that has been achieved is an endorsement for that kind of politics
2929750 i think gary has done an outstanding job and would have made a significant contribution
2929751 we have certainly improved our position in fannie bay i am more confident of holding fannie bay mr henderson told reporters outside parliament house

2929755 the divestiture of our broadband media processing business is consistent with our overall strategy of improving our business model and generating positive cash flow focusing our investments on the market segments where we either lead or have the opportunity to lead and establishing a long term sustainable capital structure
2929756 our continuing businesses which consist of imaging and pc media and broadband access address a total available market that is more than 3 billion today and expected to grow at a compound annual rate of seven percent over the next several years and we plan to expand our presence in each of the major market segments we serve

2929758 moving forward i am confident that the combined team will attain even higher levels of success
2929759 russia will have to think real hard before delivering this system to iran which is possibly on the brink of conflict with either israel or the us since if the system is delivered an ew electronic warfare system will likely be developed to neutralize it and if that happens it would be catastrophic not only for iran but also for russia
2929760 no country will want to buy the system if it is proven to be ineffective
2929761 for these reasons russia may not deliver it in the end to iran

2929820 el paquete de reformas incluye entre otras modificaciones a la ley general de salud y al impi adelant el presidente de la comisi n de salud de la c mara de diputados
2929821 estamos buscando que para el 2010 nada m s haya dos tipos de medicamentos los innovadores y no innovadores gen ricos intercambiables
2929822 si los laboratorios no quieren ser solidarios con el gobierno en esta propuesta dijo se buscar n las medidas legales que puedan aplicarse para disminuir el costo de las medicinas
2929823 esa es la prioridad si hay que modificar y tocar algunas leyes diferentes a las de salud estaremos como legisladores actuando en consecuencia
2929824 simplemente que con los datos que se tienen el mismo laboratorio con el mismo medicamento en dos pa ses diferentes fija precios absurdos
2929825 si esa actitud se sigue dando estaremos actuando en consecuencia si no es en un acuerdo en la mesa de negociaci n que se instal con la secretar a de salud la secretar a de econom a la c mara nacional de la industria farmac utica canifarma y las empresas farmac uticas entonces estaremos haciendo uso de las herramientas jur dicas
2929826 candados que impiden que en una situaci n en particular se pueda declarar una alerta para enfermedades como el sida para que m xico pueda hacer a un lado las patentes y se produzcan en nuestro pa s los medicamentos pues adem s hay la infraestructura necesaria para ello
2929827 es un asunto al que hay que entrarle con la disposici n de que el pa s no tenga que estar invirtiendo tantos recursos en los medicamentos y que ello se pueda reflejar en beneficio de la ciudadan a ya que la poblaci n paga altos costos en medicamentos de patente
2929828 nos queda claro que las empresas farmac utica no son hermanas de la caridad son negocios y su objetivo es la ganancia hacen un trabajo de investigaci n y en dos d as quieren obtener su inversi n

2929851 i dont want to support russia georgia or abkhazia but i think georgia is doing a stupid thing by making war during the olympic games
2929852 if we need we are ready to go back to georgia like soldiers because our country needs it if we need it but i think after the president asked us to stay here we have to respect this and stay here
2929853 its all the same to me who knows whos to blame

2929856 combining malaria and ntd control practices in a unified anemia framework affords one of the best opportunities to reduce the perfect storm of anemia morbidity and mortality in sub saharan africa
2929857 in addition to the health improvement that would result from anemia reduction there is also some evidence that hookworm and schistosomiasis and possibly other ntds may promote increased susceptibility to malaria so that ntd control would work in synergy with nets and other measures to reduce malaria incidence
2929858 based on this link the public private partnerships of the global network for ntds are working to identify opportunities for integrating malaria and ntd control efforts in sub saharan africa
2929859 the networks effective system of delivering treatment through trained local community coordinators is an ideal way to enhance malaria control and ntd control efforts and ultimately reduce deadly cases of these diseases and anemia
2929860 another promising low cost and highly cost effective and complementary approach for potentially reducing the morbidity of malaria in sub saharan africa
2929861 an integrated control program for tropical anemia in africa represents one of our better hopes for a quick win in the fight for sustainable disease control and poverty reduction integration
2929862 being aware of detrimental weather conditions enables people to plan ahead and avoid situations that could aggravate their condition
2929863 this exciting pilot will be a major step forward for medicare we believe that it will provide information and tools that will empower consumers to manage their health
2929864 importantly we intend for the pilot to provide beneficiaries with a choice of products that will make it possible for beneficiaries to meet their individual needs
2929865 at medicare we strive to find innovative ways to better serve our beneficiaries
2929866 this pilot is designed to evaluate how well phrs meet the needs of our beneficiaries and whether phrs can improve health outcomes and lower costs
2929867 we spent most of last night working on a fix for a worm which was targeting people on facebook and placing messages on walls urging users to view a video that pretends to be hosted on a google or youtube website
2929868 less than 002 percent of people on facebook have been affected all of whom we notified and suggested steps to remove the malware
2929869 if we get a report of a bug or a hole from a user a security researcher a reporter blogger or anyone we check it out and fix it as quickly as possible
2929870 in fact we appreciate it when help comes our way from the many security experts and organisations out there
2929871 he is a young player who has shown huge potential with his performances for both cardiff city and wales at under 17 and under 21 levels he is still only 17 but has already shown that he is a very intelligent and mature player with great quality
2929872 although he mainly plays in midfield aaron is a versatile player and can also play across the defence we are all looking forward to welcoming aaron to the club for our pre season preparations
2929873 education is not filling a bucket but lighting a fire
2929874 the united nations foundation is honored to work with first lady laura bush to deliver these nets so that families can protect themselves from malaria as the rainy season approaches
2929875 internally displaced people and refugees are highly vulnerable to contracting malaria but we know that these nets will help save lives citizens in the united states and around the world can get involved in sending a net and saving a life at nothingbutnets net
2929876 we are very pleased with the final results of the double blind clinical trial and are excited to have our first revenue producing molecular diagnostic test ready for commercialization
2929877 the successful development validation and commercialization of this new molecular diagnostic test for prostate cancer proves that hdc by combining our patented svm and svm rfe technology and our expert scientific team has the ability to produce new molecular diagnostic and prognostic tests which are the future of personalized medicine our patent protected discovery method allows us to develop molecular diagnostic and prognostic tests that are free of outside intellectual property rights and thereby allows hdc to fully patent protect our molecular diagnostic gene signatures using the same expertise of our scientific team and the hdc patented technology we are currently developing additional new molecular diagnostic tests in a variety of other cancers some of which we hope will be commercially available in q4 of 2008
2929878 we are pleased to have hdcs new gene based prostate cancer test enter the market like similar molecular diagnostic tests based on unique gene expression profiles such as oncotypedx from genomic health inc nasdaqgm ghdx and mammaprint from agendia
2929879 the excellent results seen in phase i phase ii and phase iii double blinded clinical trials validate the scientific accuracy and robustness of the hdc gene based molecular diagnostic test for prostate cancer
2929880 physicians that are diagnosing and treating prostate cancer patients will be greatly assisted by the additional information that this new prostate cancer test will add to their decision making process
2929881 we are very impressed with the results from these validation studies and i applaud the development teams from both clarient and hdc for their diligent efforts in bringing this new test through the validation phase significantly ahead of schedule the early results from these studies confirm our belief that this powerful genomics based test may provide physicians with useful information to ensure that men with prostate cancer get a more accurate diagnosis sooner and minimize the need for unnecessary biopsies
2929882 we are providing a lifeline to family physicians who otherwise may be forced to turn away medi cal patients or even shut down their practices entirely
2929883 the state of californias medi cal payments to physicians are the lowest in the nation this underpayment threatens the existence of family medicine practices across the state
2929884 but the state is paying less than it costs us to provide care family physicians simply cant afford to continue subsidizing patient care out of our own pockets
2929885 the governor and our legislators are escalating the primary care physician shortage crisis by refusing to adequately pay the very doctors who keep californians healthy
2929886 family physicians provide preventive care and manage chronic illnesses like heart disease and diabetes when patients cant find a doctor to care for them they delay seeking care or they turn to emergency rooms where care is more expensive and a framework for essential continuity of care does not exist
2929887 its a sad day for health care when a medical specialty society is paying for health care thats actually the states responsibility to provide
2929888 we call on the governor and the legislature to pass a state budget that allows californians access to essential health care and we call on our elected leaders to continue their work on comprehensive health care reform
2929889 the reply pacemaker delivers to the market sorin groups 2nd generation universal pacing platform built around our exclusive safer pacing mode reply and safer demonstrate sorin groups continued commitment to driving innovation in cardiac rhythm management and reinforces our mission to continuously improve the treatment of bradycardia
2929890 the updated 2008 acc aha guidelines for device based therapy highlight the new standard of care in pacing which is to minimize unnecessary ventricular pacing the reply pacemaker was the right choice for this patient pacemaker options that only offer av delay or av search hysteresis do not eliminate frequent ventricular pacing for a significant number of patients its important to know that down sized devices do not mean that physicians have to compromise reply provides the output longevity and pacing algorithms that physicians are looking for in a pacemaker
2929891 we are excited to have enrolled the first patient in this study
2929892 we have anticipated the clinical evaluation of this drug in breast cancer based on promising preclinical studies
2929893 this is an important milestone in the clinical development of our lead anti cancer drug
2929894 extending the clinical testing of grn163l to breast cancer reflects the potentially broad and important role of telomerase in fighting cancer
2929895 at the time i realized that like most men i was clueless about prostate cancer and was flummoxed at how little men know about their own bodies
2929896 i later realized that i could use my own abilities to help raise awareness by drawing attention to prostate cancer im hoping more men will get prostate checkups and psa screenings and that more research will focus on this disease when was the last time you heard someone talk about prostate cancer
2929897 it has been a gratifying experience i was one man but the support generosity and personal stories of so many wonderful people who traveled with me in my heart lifted my kayak
2929898 along the way i met hundreds of men of all ages and their families many of who have been touched directly by prostate cancer for others it was the first time they really thought about this disease if i reached just a dozen men who are now committed to annual prostate screening and early detection it has been worth the effort
2929899 skips heroic effort is an inspiration for prostate cancer patients and their families
2929900 discoveries in prostate cancer research have made important advances possible many men afflicted by this cancer can now live longer productive lives through early detection and better treatments skip is a terrific example of how much progress weve made while there is certainly more progress to be made we believe an end to death and suffering from prostate cancer is in site

2929909 adopting too conservative an approach risks disenfranchising many users and therefore edina will evaluate how its services can be presented and personalised to address changing information seeking and user practices including access through devices other than computer screens such as pdas and mobile phones
2929910 this is a threat faced by officers in prisons from across the country this is why the prison service is preparing direct intervention if ever a prison officer is taken hostage
2929911 they have helped immensely in the baghdad area in particular to take down the al qaeda car bomb networks and other al qaeda operations in iraqs capital city so they have done a phenomenal job in that regard
2929912 they have exceptional initiative exceptional skill exceptional courage and i think exceptional savvy i cant say enough about how impressive they are in thinking on their feet

2929915 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
2929916 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado

2929918 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales

2929921 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
2929922 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
2929923 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
2929924 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
2929925 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
2929926 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
2929927 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
