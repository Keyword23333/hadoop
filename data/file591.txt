5910000 i would have been really disappointed and im sure the players who didnt get it feel the same way
5910001 i was standing next to rio and the first thing he did was shake my hand which is great and shows what kind of man and character he is
5910002 you hear little whispers and with the form that rio has been in and what man utd have achieved i did think he would get it manchester united in the last couple of years what he has achieved has been an example we can all learn from that and its great that i beat players like that to the job
5910003 the manager said he takes control of all the tactics and all those big decisions and its my job to keep the players moving forward
5910004 instead of oneupping try one downing instead of outdoing try underdoing
5910005 simplicity is not the goal we do not wish to give up the power and flexibility of our technologies
5910006 the garage door opener may be simple but it hardly does anything if my cellphone only had one button it certainly would be simple but umm all i could do would be to turn it on or off i wouldnt be able to make a phone call
5910007 everyone wants more capability so therefore they want more features everyone wants ease of use so therefore they want simplicity
5910008 the arrow goes left to right this says nothing about the right to left direction so extra capability does not require more features similarly ease of use does not require simplicity
5910009 what is happening to me why am i feeling this way is there someone out there who cares to know just how much im hurting in spite of all my pain i know gods still there why should i forget his promise to me
5910010 i was astonished and i asked her why she said so she replied
5910011 i asked you how you got your current car about a year ago you said your dad bought it for you when i asked you about your laptop you said the same thing now your phone i wish my dad was here to buy me all i need too bad hes in ghana
5910012 the problem now is that there is no political will to debate these issues we have tried successfully with other infectious diseases like leprosy tuberculosis and dengue fever why not hiv aids
5910013 if he dr sitaleki finau for one second put himself in that position how would he feel about being isolated himself would he like it i think not
5910014 when hiv aids first came on the who agenda the public attitude towards it was terrible and it made life so much harder for those people who suffered from the disease when someone is sick we should be helping them and many of those people got infected through no fault of their own
5910015 australia was at the forefront of the campaign and we were right behind in total support
5910016 we are honored to have the pacific islands aids foundation headquarters here in rarotonga the work they do is so very valuable for our people in the pacific
5910017 i dont think so i think its about getting in touch with reality about balancing aspirations and actuality
5910018 since the second world war and the beginning of the atomic age the consciousness of the creative writer however detached has been confronted with the specter of the totalitarian state the growing poverty and helplessness of western europe and the threat of an inconceivably destructive war which may annihilate civilization and mankind itself clearly when the future of civilization is no longer assured a criticism if american life in terms of a contrast between avowed ideals and present actuality cannot be a primary preoccupation and source of inspiration for america not europe is now the sanctuary of culture civilizations very existence depends upon america upon the actuality of american life and not the ideals of the american dream to criticize the actuality upon which all hope depends thus becomes a criticism of hope itself
5910019 ive got nothing to do and im doing it tomorrow
5910020 obviously if you are reading this then i have died in iraq i kind of predicted this that is why im writing this in november a third time just seemed like im pushing my chances i dont regret going everybody dies but few get to do it for something as important as freedom it may seem confusing why we are in iraq its not to me im here helping these people so that they can live the way we live not have to worry about tyrants or vicious dictators to do what they want with their lives to me that is why i died others have died for my freedom now this is my mark
5910021 nobody is interested in solutions if they dont think theres a problem given that starting point i believe it is appropriate to have an over representation of factual presentations on how dangerous it is as a predicate for opening up the audience to listen to what the solutions are and how hopeful it is that we are going to solve this crisis
5910022 there is unmistakable evidence that saddam hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years
5910023 saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process
5910024 there is no doubt that saddam hussein has invigorated his weapons programs in addition saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer range missiles that will threaten the united states and our allies
5910025 how close is the peril of iraqi wmd today or at most within a few months iraq could launch missile attacks with chemical or biological weapons against its neighbors albeit attacks that would be ragged inaccurate and limited in size within four or five years it could have the capability to threaten most of the middle east and parts of europe with missiles armed with nuclear weapons containing fissile material produced indigenously and to threaten u s territory with such weapons delivered by nonconventional means such as commercial shipping containers if it managed to get its hands on sufficient quantities of already produced fissile material these threats could arrive much sooner
5910026 iraq is automatically an imminent threat to the countries that surround it because of the possession of these weapons
5910027 i agree with president bush he has said that saddam hussein is evil and he is hussein is a vicious dictator and a documented deceiver he has invaded his neighbors used chemical arms and failed to account for all the chemical and biological weapons he had before the gulf war he has murdered dissidents and refused to comply with his obligations under un security council resolutions and he has tried to build a nuclear bomb anyone who believes in the importance of limiting the spread of weapons of mass killing the value of democracy and the centrality of human rights must agree that saddam hussein is a menace the world would be a better place if he were in a different place other than the seat of power in baghdad or any other country
5910028 theres no question that saddam hussein is a threat yes he has chemical and biological weapons he is as far as we know actively pursuing nuclear capabilities though he doesnt have nuclear warheads yet if he were to acquire nuclear weapons i think our friends in the region would face greatly increased risks as would we
5910029 i t is incontestable that on the day i left office there were unaccounted for stocks of biological and chemical weapons we might have destroyed them in 98 we tried to but we sure as heck didnt know it because we never got to go back there
5910030 other countries possess weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles
5910031 when former president bill clinton was here recently he told me was absolutely convinced given his years in the white house and the access to privileged information which he had that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction until the end of the saddam regime
5910032 he will use those weapons of mass destruction again as he has 10 times since 1983
5910033 iraq is a long way from here but what happens there matters a great deal here for the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face
5910034 what the hell did she think that i am google
5910035 since all the sikkim political parties are of one view we want the state government to show lead to other states in the country by passing a resolution in favour of separate state for indian gorkhas
5910036 sikkim is not the only state that comes in the parisanghs nationwide strategy the bgp has already done its homework on several other states using its network for a similar resolution though we have already received positive response from some states we feel that sikkim should kickstart this campaign
5910037 the 4th pay commission ought to have been constituted much before in view of the fact that the pay revision had fallen due in 2006 delay in constitution of the commission has resulted in denial of justice to the sikkim government employees
5910038 the retired government servants are in dilemma whether they will come within the purview of the pay revision and if not why such step motherly treatment
5910039 the nine freedom rock tour 08 in collaboration with the sikkim state aids control society here at the guards ground tathangchen on august 17 with the organization of the rock show nine has spread the cause of aids awareness in a way befitting those who are genuinely socially conscious
5910040 the old media radio today has taken a new avatar which the people of sikkim were missing i believe nine will bridge the gap
5910041 this form of media has never been explored in the state before which will be presenting a platform for the immensely talented individuals here generating local employment expanding economies and of course providing entertainment
5910042 our motto is to provide the listeners with the best available quality and the technology we would not compromise on these two things
5910043 i was doing construction under the guidance of the department i was following the guidelines and drawings supplied by the department time to time
5910044 the company is carrying out survey in the state that too without the permission from the state home department
5910045 during the last six months we have tirelessly working day and night to impart the education of computer knowledge to the rural people including panchayat students and the local village people and this is what we are getting in return
5910046 if needed be a call will be given to the gorkha brothers guarding the border
5910047 we will simply walk out if there is no discussion on gorkhaland in the tripartite talks we will give a call to our brothers guarding the nations borders and those working in police forces in the final moment
5910048 we wont accept anything less than gorkhaland and we also know how to attain our rights
5910049 we request a representative from siliguri to attend the tripartite talks which should only discuss on gorkhaland
5910050 this new movement will be successful we must get freedom from the bengal exploitation
5910051 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks it could be a boomerang storm
5910052 for people to suggest that i and the illinois medical society so illinois doctors were somehow in favor of withholding lifesaving support from an infant born alive is ridiculous
5910053 barack obama is so radically pro abortion he supports infanticide
5910054 the suggestion that obama the proud father of two little girls and others who opposed these bills supported infanticide is deeply offensive and insulting
5910055 he needs to explain misleading people he needs to explain why he apparently covered that up
5910056 theyre being very dishonest about their depiction of what happened with that bill or just clueless
5910057 realize an object of type x but i dont know what concrete type it should be
5910058 in fact it is stronger than it has ever been so far
5910059 it might not register that its really land at this point
5910060 hi i am willing to work with you blah blah will be accepted
5910061 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5910062 the threat that the u s and israel face from the islamic republic of iran is today greater than ever
5910063 we israel are benefiting from one thing and that is the attack on the twin towers and the pentagon and the american struggle in iraq
5910064 the duty of americans to support an island of democracy in the middle east
5910065 threatens the security of the united states and its allies worldwide thats because jerusalem and israel are ground zero in the global battle between tyranny and democracy radicalism and moderation terrorism and freedom
5910066 the rabbis say in the talmud that a lot of rabbinic law is to put a fence around the torah so you dont get near to violating it well mccain has a series of very clear headed policies toward terrorism and islamic extremism that put extra layers behind his support for israel
5910067 jerusalem is not merely the capital of israel but the spiritual capital of jews and christians everywhere its the site of the first and second temples which housed the holy of holies and its the direction in which we jews face when we pray this glorious city of david is bound to the jewish people by an undeniable 3 000 year historical link
5910068 the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government
5910069 im not going to be one of those parents that never see their child again and we only have one
5910070 i looked straight at the flight attendant i turned right at her and i gave her a look like where do i go and she just said have a good day
5910071 i just thought oh my god im going to be one of those people that know what it feels like to have their child abducted and you have no idea where to look next
5910072 our job in this election is not just win although im a big believer in winning
5910073 i dont intend to lose this election john mccain doesnt know what hes up against
5910074 he can talk all he wants about britney spears and paris hilton but i dont have time for that mess
5910075 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5910076 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5910077 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5910078 barack obama has made it clear that unconditional withdrawal in iraq is more important to him than victory in iraq thats not a criticism of his patriotism thats a criticism of his judgment
5910079 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5910080 let me tell you first what i wont do i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president and not know necessarily what hes doing
5910081 my vice president will be a member of the executive branch he wont be one of these fourth branches of government where he thinks hes above the law
5910082 needs to figure out if hes going to let rush limbaugh and the right wing of his party direct his choice
5910083 john mccain bio is pro life always has been and his administration will be pro life anyone picked as his vice president will respect those views
5910084 wow i am so lucky i have 4 beautiful daughters

5910093 lord bs establishment consists besides servants of ten horses eight enormous dogs three monkeys five cats an eagle a crow and a falcon and all of these except the horses walk about the house which every now and then resounds with their unarbitrated quarrels as if they were the masters of it
5910094 i find that my enumeration of the animals in this circean palace was defective and that in a material point i have just met on the grand staircase five peacocks two guinea hens and an egyptian crane
5910095 he has sometimes gone so long without taking his shoes off that then the skin came away like a snakes with the boots
5910096 great empedocles that ardent soul leapt into etna and was roasted whole
5910097 the federal communications commission found a way to squeeze us in instead of squeezing us out
5910098 the bad news is we have to move the good news is were still on the air which means we will be able to continue serving the community
5910099 from the moment we found out that kdrts frequency was being threatened by encroachment a coalition of kdrt programmers other community volunteers and dmas staff and board began organizing a concerted campaign to try to fight this
5910100 the save our station or sos campaign focused on public education cultivating support from elected officials and public policy makers and raising money to pay for the legal and engineering fees associated with the fight we knew it was a long shot and we also knew we had to try
5910101 the unfortunate turmoil that kdrt lp was subjected to when its frequency was undermined by a full power station had a silver lining
5910102 while some smaller low power stations were quickly intimidated by corporate lawyers who told them their channel was no longer theirs kdrts strong organization helped bring public attention to the plight of low power groups having their stations taken
5910103 the impact of kdrts story was felt in washington dc and the fcc has at least provisionally changed course on supporting the rights of community media as the result of kdrt lp and stations in similar predicaments standing up for their rights
5910104 this is great proof that the davis community cares deeply about freedom as long as peoples voices can be heard on their airwaves we have a powerful tool for questioning the work of our government while also listening to great music
5910105 this community dug into its pockets and hearts to come up against the fcc and our small voice was heard all the way to the office of the chairman
5910106 it took a long time for the surge in commodity prices to seep into the general economy so dont expect one month of commodity price declines to suddenly turn off the inflation pump
5910107 a firmer dollar retreating commodity prices and continued economic weakness should damp inflation by the fall
5910108 were creating an ambiance a point of relaxation a meeting place
5910109 they started in los angeles and flourished there for a reason
5910110 because l a is all about image and hype and being seen being seen doing things that are cool people see a photo of paris eating pinkberry and they want it
5910111 the question is are you going to just be a niche player or will you be a national chain
5910112 they clearly are getting a nice buzz within the population but we often mistake our willingness to try new things as a trend

5910114 theres a big part of america that really believes that and that we need to finish up
5910115 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to
5910116 so as far as leadership and patriotism goes i think its really important that those things have to take place

5910118 according to a press release issued by petroleos de venezuela s a pdvsa pdvsa will proceed to take operational control of the plants of cemex venezuela
5910119 the mexican government has formally informed venezuela of its support for the companys request to continue negotiations
5910120 continue negotiations based on the principles of dialogue non discrimination compromise and openness
5910121 i think there is still room for negotiation we are not at the point of no return
5910122 the cemex case is very complicated but the numbers which we are using for it are close to the governments offer

5910127 good judgment comes from experience experience comes from bad judgment
5910128 id like to give you a piece of my mind
5910129 before you hire a company to build a house you would i expect insist on detailed plans showing what the finished structure was going to look like building a childs mind and character is what public schools do their justification for prematurely breaking family and neighborhood learning where is documentary evidence to prove this assumption that trained and certified professionals do it better than people who know and love them can there isnt any the cost in new york state for building a well schooled child in the year 2000 is 200 000 per body when lost interest is calculated that capital sum invested in the childs name over the past twelve years would have delivered a million dollars to each kid as a nest egg to compensate for having no school the original 200 000 is more than the average home in new york costs you wouldnt build a home without some idea what it would look like when finished but you are compelled to let a corps of perfect strangers tinker with your childs mind and personality without the foggiest idea what they want to do with it

5910134 the timing of the announcement by fda raises eyebrows considering the california legislature is about to vote on a measure to remove the toxic chemical from some childrens products bpa has been linked to altered brain development behavioral changes and prostate problems in animals and should not be used in any consumer products that could potentially leach into food and liquids especially in products young children use every single day we have long since lost faith in fdas ability to be an impartial authority on bpas safety time and again fda has sided with special interests instead of the public interest on this chemical

5910170 berpuasalah kalian karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah karena melihatnya hilal bulan syawal jika kalian terhalang awan maka sempurnakanlah syaban tiga puluh hari
5910171 janganlah kalian mendahului bulan ramadhan dengan puasa satu atau dua hari kecuali seseorang diantara kalian yang biasa berpuasa padanya dan janganlah kalian berpuasa sampai melihatnya hilal syawal jika ia hilal terhalang awan maka sempurnakanlah bilangan tiga puluh hari kemudian berbukalah iedul fithri dan satu bulan itu 29 hari
5910172 apabila datang bulan ramadhan amka berpuasalah 30 hari kecuali sebelum itu kalian melihat hilal
5910173 puasalah karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah karena melihatnya jika awan menghalangi kalian sempurnakanlah tiga puluh hari jika dua orang saksi mempersaksikan ruyah hilal maka berpuasalah dan berbukalah kalian karenanya
5910174 manusia sedang melihat lihat munculnya hilal aku beritahukan kepada nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam bahwa aku melihatnya maka beliau berpuasa dan memerintahkan manusia untuk berpuasa
5910175 kuraib mengabarkan bahwa ummu fadll bintul harits mengutusnya kepada muawiyyah di syam
5910176 aku sampai di syam kemudian aku memenuhi keperluannya dan diumumkan tentang hilal ramadhan sedangkan aku masih berada di syam
5910177 para ulama berbeda pendapat tentang hal ini atas beberapa pendapat
5910178 keharusan ruyah bagi setiap negeri yang tidak samar atas mereka hilal
5910179 tidak harus sama jika berbeda dua arah yakni tinggi dan rendah yang menyebabkan salah satunya mudah melihat hilal dan yang lain sulit atau bagi setiap negeri mempunyai iklim hal ini diceritakan oleh al mahdi dalam al bahr dari imam yahya dan hadawiyah
5910180 orang orang yang menyatakan bahwa ruyah tidak digunakan bagi semuanya negeri negeri seperti kebanyakan pengikut pengikut madzhab syafii diantaranya mereka ada yang membatasi dengan jarak qashar shalat ada yang membatasi dengan perbedaan mathla seperti hijaz dengan syam iraq dengan khurasan kedua duanya lemah dhaif karena jarak qashar shalat tidak berkaitan dengan hilal apabila seseorang menyaksikan pada malam ke 30 bulan syaban di suatu tempat dekat maupun jauh maka wajib puasa demikian juga kalau menyaksikan hilal pada waktu siang menjelang maghrib maka harus imsak berpuasa untuk waktu yang tersisa sama saja baik satu iklim atau banyak iklim
5910181 apabila penduduk suatu negeri melihat hilal maka seluruh negeri harus mengikutinya
5910182 saya demi allah tidak mengetahui apa yang menghalangi sayyid sabiq sehingga dia memilih pendapat yang syadz ganjil ini dan enggan mengambil keumuman hadits yang shahih dan merupakan pendapat jumhur ulama sebagaimana yang dia sebutkan sendiri
5910183 puasa kalian adalah hari kalian berpuasa dan berbuka kalian iedul fithri adalah hari kalian berbuka tidak berpuasa dan adha kalian adalah hari kalian berkurban
5910184 sanadnya jayyid dan rawi rawinya semuanya tsiqah lihat silsilah al hadits as shahihah 1 440
5910185 sebagian ahlu ilmi ulama mentafsirkan hadits ini bahwa puasa dan iedul fithri bersama mayoritas manusia
5910186 dalam hadits itu terdapat dalil bahwa hari ied ditetapkan bersama manusia orang yang mengetahui hari ied dengan ruyah sendirian wajib baginya untuk mencocoki lainnya dan mengharuskan dia untuk mengikuti mereka didalam shalat iedul fithri dan iedul adha
5910187 dikatakan bahwa di dalam hadits itu terdapat bantahan terhadap orang yang mengatakan bahwa barangsiapa mengetahui terbitnya bulan dengan perkiraan hisab boleh baginya untuk berpuasa dan berbuka berbeda dengan orang yang tidak tahu juga dikatakan makna yang terkandung dalam hadits itu bahwa saksi satu orang apabila melihat hilal sedangkan hakim tidak menerima persaksiannya maka dia tidak boleh berpuasa sebagaimana manusia tidak berpuasa
5910188 yang jelas maknanya adalah bahwa perkara perkara ini bukan untuk perorangan tidak boleh bersendirian dalam hal itu perkaranya tetap diserahkan kepada imam dan jamaah atas dasar ini jika seseorang melihat hilal sedangkan imam menolak persaksiannya maka seharusnya tidak diakui dan wajib atasnya untuk mengikuti jamaah pada yang demikian itu
5910189 nahr adalah hari manusia menyembelih kurban dan iedul fithri adalah hari manusia berbuka
5910190 apa yang sudah menjadi ketetapan sebuah hukum tidak berbeda keadaannya pada orang yang diikuti dalam ruyah hilal sama saja dia seorang mujtahid yang benar atau salah atau melampaui batas tentang masalah apabila hilal tidak tampak dan tidak diumumkan padahal manusia sangat bersemangat mencarinya telah tersebut dalam as shahihah bahwa nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam bersabda tentang para imam mereka para imam shalat bersama kalian jika mereka benar maka pahala bagi kalian dan mereka dan jika salah maka pahala bagi kalian dan dosa atas mereka
5910191 pendapat yang masyhur dalam madzhab imam ahmad adalah wajib puasa pada waktu itu
5910192 apabila kalian melihat hilal ramadhan maka puasalah dan apabila melihatnya hilal syawal maka berbukalah jika mendung atas kalian maka kira kirakanlah
5910193 barang siapa berpuasa pada hari yang diragukan maka dia sungguh telah bermaksiat kepada abul qasim shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
5910194 tidak berpuasa pada saat itu adalah madzhab imam ahmad imam ahmad juga mengatakan bahwa berpuasa pada hari yang diragukan adalah mendahului ramadhan dengan puasa satu hari sungguh nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam telah melarang hal itu yang masih diragukan adalah tentang wajibnya berpuasa pada hari itu padahal tidak wajib dilakukan bahkan yang disunnahkan adalah meninggalkannya kalau dikatakan boleh dua perkara maka sunnah untuk berbuka itu lebih utama
5910195 aku tidak mendapatkan dari ahmad bahwa beliau menegaskan wajibnya dan memerintahkannya maka janganlah pendapat diatas dinisbatkan kepadanya
5910196 tidak diragukan lagi bahwa para peneliti dari kalangan madzhab hambali dan selainnya berpendapat tentang tidak wajibnya berpuasa bahkan dimakruhkan atau diharamkan
5910197 ketahuilah bahwa hari yang diragukan adalah hari ke 30 dari bulan syaban apabila tidak terlihat hilal pada malam itu karena ada awan yang menghalangi atau selainnya bisa jadi saat itu bulan ramadhan atau syaban dan makna hadits ammar dan selainnya menunjukkan atas haramnya puasa pada saat itu
5910198 janganlah kalian dahului ramadhan dengan puasa satu atau dua hari kecuali orang yang biasa berpuasa bertepatan pada hari itu maka puasalah
5910199 barangsiapa berpuasa pada hari yang diragukan maka sungguh dia telah bermaksiat kepada abul qasim qasim shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
5910200 hadits diatas sebagai dalil bahwa shalat ied dilaksanakan hari kedua tatkala waktu ied diketahui dengan jelas sesuadah keluar habis waktu shalat

5910206 i love and respect my mate and my mate loves and respects me
5910207 my children are a constant source of love and joy in my life
5910208 if you arent good at loving yourself you will have a difficult time loving anyone since youll resent the time and energy you give another person that you arent even giving to yourself
5910209 a frase ressoava lhes a cabe a mas n o a pronunciavam
5910210 o que seduzia mark ta em eva era o encanto da sua singularidade s aquela maneira de lhe dirigir imediatamente a palavra
5910211 uma ca adora de inesqueciveis experiencias n o admitia o amor s a amizade e a sensualidade
5910212 eva era muito dotada para a camaradagem e recusava o amor o seu egoismo e a sua histeria
5910213 toda rela o amorosa assenta em conven es n o escritas que aqueles que se amam concluem inconsideradamente durante as primeiras semanas do amor que sentem um pelo outro ainda est o numa especie de sonho mas ao mesmo tempo sem o saberem redigem como juristas intrataveis as clausulas pormenorizadas do contrato que os une que os amantes sejam prudentes nestes dias perigosos se se leva o pequeno almo o cama do outro vai ser preciso levar lho sempre para n o ser pronunciada a acusa o de n o amor e de trai o
5910214 logo nas primeiras semanas de amor ficou decidido entre karel e mark ta que karel seria infiel e que mark ta o aceitaria mas que mark ta teria o direito de ser a melhor e que karel se sentiria culpado em rela o a ela ningu m sabia melhor que mark ta como era triste ser a melhor era a melhor mas s falta de melhor
5910215 evidentemente que mark ta bem sabia no fundo que esta conversa telefonica era em si mesma insignificante mas o importante n o era a conversa em si era o que ela representava exprimia numa eloquente concis o toda a situa o de sua vida o que mark ta faz f lo por karel e por causa de karel trata lhe de m e apresenta lhe a melhor amiga da lha de presente s por ele e pelo prazer que ele pode sentir e porque ela faz tudo isso porque se esfor a tanto porque que empurra sua rocha como um s sifo fa a o que fizer karel est mentalmente ausente
5910216 amavam se os dois mas tinham necessidade de algu m que lhes aligierasse o fardo de algu m que os libertasse
5910217 e no fundo nem fazia quest o em tecer uma hist ria queria simplesmente estar s
5910218 no instante que lhe tirou a cabe a do corpo sentiu o contato desconhecido e inebriante da liberdade este anonimato dos corpos era o paraiso repentinamente descoberto com um estranho prazer expulsava de si a alma magoada e demasiado vigilante e metamorfoseava se num simples corpo sem memoria nem passado mas por isso mesmo mais receptivo e avido
5910219 sempre a tinha amado mas hoje pela primeira vez amava a com todos os sentidos por ela propria pelo seu corpo e pela sua pele e inebriava se desse amor carnal como se fosse uma revela o s bita
5910220 bem gostaria de ultrapassar as velhas conven es n o escritas mas como faze lo sem aniquilar o amor
5910221 although the definition is similar to the proposed federal legislation its application would have a different impact on state abortion law

5910234 denouncing terrorism and insisting that it has no relation whatsoever with islam
5910235 the very idea of a terrorist glorying in violence and describing himself as a jihadi was denounced as an abomination

5910240 i think the first game showed that we have a lot of work to do
5910241 we have some pieces but we have to find our form marcus had some quality finishes hes always a threat that the opposing team has to worry about
5910242 it was great to get the goals but the goals were mainly due to great balls
5910243 as a striker you have to finish your opportunities all the credit goes to my teammates i just did the best i could to get the goals
5910244 ive worked with a lot of artists em and they all have a need that cannot be met by another human being

5910252 when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of the action
5910253 the claim accrues upon awareness of the actual injury i e the adverse employment action and not when the plaintiff suspects a legal wrong
5910254 i didnt fire them because they were women i fired them because they were trying to organize a union
5910255 it is aggressive even you know the squeegee on the car theyre really in your face
5910256 the security guard right there is going to bring more aggression and more violence to these streets
5910257 sometimes the security guards take their job a little too seriously they think they have more power than they have especially in the alleyways and where theres no cameras or witnesses and you know security guards sometimes they go too far
5910258 we do not have a high crime situation in chinatown but when there are people like loitering and there are people taking drugs and you know rowdiness chinatown means business and they should move along
5910259 chinatown is a busy area you can see its a mall you know malls actually have security guards and we want to try it to see how that works
5910260 yesterday night we were at a restaurant a panhandler came in and just you know asked for money
5910261 this is very much a reflection i think of a level of frustration of the businesses in chinatown there is a problem we have 400 panhandlers in the downtown core and you know these are people who are obnoxious theyve got addictions theyre panhandling to feed these addictions and theyre interfering with these business people
5910262 i think its already making a difference i have members from my business improvement area they came to me and you know said that we should have tried this a long time ago
5910263 one is to make whats called a citizens arrest which is where we find someone committing in real time with our own eyes an indictable offence so someone beating somebody up somebody breaking into a car that sort of thing
5910264 then if they come back in and recommit the offence then we can arrest for entry where entry prohibited
5910265 just like any normal citizen or you yourself in your house you could hold somebody call the police and thats what they would do
5910266 wherever they see me they watch me like a hawk they tell me if they see me trespassing again theyll arrest me they give me a ticket a lot of times
5910267 how can we get more and more people to see our offer

5910272 many of us often question ourselves why is there so much spam the answer is because enough people are purchasing products from spam to make it a worthwhile for spammers
5910273 spam is commonly believed to attract very low response rates estimates indicate there is often less than ten purchases made for every million spam messages sent but most of these messages are blocked by spam filters
5910274 this means the actual response rates are much higher if you only count those emails that make it into a persons inbox

5910289 im a guy that does the right things on and off the field im not worried about my reputation being tarnished for me telling the truth
5910290 the fbi could get a wiretap to investigate the mafia but they could not get one to investigate terrorists to put it bluntly that was crazy whats good for the mob should be good for terrorists
5910291 we simply cannot prevail in the battle against terrorism if the right hand of our government has no idea what the left hand is doing

5910310 i stay focused on my highest priorities and dont worry about what isnt getting done since its not my highest priority
5910311 i relieve my stress by exercising every morning i also make sure my assistant schedules me in a hotel with an excellent fitness center when im on the road i stayed at a westin last week that had a treadmill in the room
5910312 spending time with my family including weekends at our second home on the lake helps me unwind its good to be in a different environment away from the everyday hustle and bustle
5910313 my mind can usually see things worse than they are i daily need to anchor my thinking in reality not fear of what might happen
5910314 with a good fraction of the new planet adhering to their feet
5910315 i left a very special situation at marquette when indiana offered me this opportunity

5910317 the much ballyhooed connection of overweight and even obesity issues to illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes have been brought into question by two studies in this weeks archives of internal medicine more than half overweight and nearly a third of obese adults in a national health nutrition survey had healthful figures for such risk markers as cholesterol including the so called good hdl cholesterol triglycerides blood pressure and blood sugar as well as insulin sensitivities by contrast almost one quarter of those recognized as having normal weights had unhealthful figures for the same risk markers

5910321 i think the two guys at the receiver position that are furthest along are decker and spry
5910322 theyre our two most experienced receivers and ralph has had a great camp so thats where we start
5910323 and hes much better than he was a year ago
5910324 they were the primary receivers now you take ernie off the team and there are 60 or so catches that somebody else has to have divide those among the returning players and the freshmen coming in and somebody has to get those catches
5910325 the thing is with this offense is that if youre in the right place youll get the ball

5910334 there are decisions to be made since we are going to be on the road on sept 1 you have to talk about them now

5910340 i oppose gay marriage and would support a constitutional amendment defining marriage civil unions are a culturally redefining issue and should have been put in the hands of the people through referendum
5910341 shut up or im scalping the crap out of you
5910342 this exposes employees to coercion harassment and denies them the right to vote on a union contract
5910343 these decisions should be made in the voting booth surrounded by a curtain not in a parking lot surrounded by union bosses
5910344 this would add another pressure point when you have to sign a card in front of a union organizer
5910345 we cannot be a party that strips working americans of the right to a secret ballot election
5910346 we are the party that has always defended the rights of the working class to fail to ensure the right to vote free of intimidation and coercion from all sides would be a betrayal of what we have always championed
5910347 the legislation is called the employee free choice act and i am sad to say it runs counter to ideals that were once at the core of the labor movement instead of providing a voice for the unheard efca risks silencing those who would speak
5910348 democrats are on the run and they are running the wrong way right now
5910349 speaker pelosi give us the opportunity to have a vote on our bill
5910350 we are very confident that the pressure the american people have put on this leadership is going to help us and the next generation of americans
5910351 we have great chances of success here because the american people are starting to rise up and understand that there is a plan to get out of this that is responsible
5910352 the local newspapers are covering it and the local radio stations are talking about it
5910353 americans are hearing the message and they are the ones that are going to change this
5910354 to date democrats have brought forward 13 major initiatives to accomplish the above goals yet each time a majority of house republicans have voted against these proposals
5910355 will consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf ocs for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
5910356 she said she would consider more drilling which is a political safety valve of couching her words very carefully

5910368 it is good to have matches before a grand slam
5910369 we both felt we couldve done a couple of things better
5910370 we tried to enjoy it and not take things seriously personally it was better than last year to win that opening match

5910493 i have just finished attending a meeting of the north atlantic council at the level of foreign ministers that meeting has produced a declaration which i am certain you now have copies of which is a comprehensive response to the crisis in georgia this was an extraordinary meeting of the north atlantic council and that in itself is a clear indication of natos interest in this crisis and natos concern that this crisis has a real impact on peace and stability in this region and therefore is crucial to the alliance there are several elements to the declaration but perhaps most important i think the declaration clearly shows that nato intends to support the territorial integrity independence and sovereignty of georgia and to support its democratically elected government its democracy and to deny russia the strategic objective of undermining that democracy of making georgia weaker or of threatening georgias territorial integrity in that regard a number of steps will be taken to support georgia including the creation as the secretary general has just said of a nato georgia commission to oversee cooperation with georgia on a wide range of matters and to oversee the program to achieve the goals of bucharest the council reaffirmed the bucharest declaration of our heads of state as well as developing this program of specific steps that we will take
5910494 remarks after the meeting of the north atlantic council at the level of foreign ministers
5910495 we have also agreed today to support georgia upon its request in a number of areas in addition we have agreed to task the north atlantic council in permanent session to develop with georgia rapidly the modalities for a nato georgia commission this commission will supervise the process set in hand at bucharest including the measures of support agreed at todays meeting these measures are intended to assist georgia a valued and long standing partner of nato to assess the damage caused by the military action and to help restore critical services necessary for normal public life and economic activity georgias recovery security and stability are important to the alliance nato will continue to cooperate with georgia in the framework of the partnership for peace and georgias individual partnership action plan with nato and will review any additional georgian requests for assistance we also welcomed the fact that a number of our governments have indicated that they will actively support measures to help the economic reconstruction of georgia the conflict between georgia and russia has compromised regional stability and security we deeply deplore the use of force in the conflict between georgia and russia we reiterate that there is no military solution to the unresolved conflicts we remind all parties that peaceful conflict resolution is a key principle of the partnership for peace framework document we remain concerned by russias actions during this crisis and remind russia of its responsibility for maintaining security and order in the areas where it exercises control especially in light of continuing reports of russias deliberate destruction of civilian infrastructure russian military action has been disproportionate and inconsistent with its peacekeeping role as well as incompatible with the principles of peaceful conflict resolution set out in the helsinki final act the nato russia founding act and the rome declaration we call on russia to take immediate action to withdraw its troops from the areas it is supposed to leave under the six principle agreement signed by president saakashvili and president medvedev1 the alliance is considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship in 2002 we established the nato russia council a framework for discussions with russia including on issues that divide the alliance and russia we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual we call on moscow to demonstrate both in word and deed its continued commitment to the principles upon which we agreed to base our relationship
5910496 meeting of the north atlantic council at the level of foreign ministers held at nato headquarters brussels on 19th august 2008
5910497 i consider realistically that yes they are tough this is a great country coming back to the first rank in the concert of nations and they want to play as they used to play as a great country
5910498 embrace it until you wear yourself out or challenge it until it is conquered
5910499 i looked up and saw the mirror reflecting the fear in my eyes beyond it was the silver of the day behind me the jaws of night gaping wider as the light slipped from view my screams giggled as they fluttered up to chase it away i tried to grab them but they refused to entertain a drowning girl
5910500 this is your ace in the hole once you play it you have to deal with your own imperfections
5910501 a quickness to learn that does not keep her from being patient with and helpful to others a high academic achievement that does not lead her to be condescending to others a wit and sense of humor that are not at the expense of others
5910502 i know this in my heart its just a matter of you realizing it in yours
5910503 and we go home trying not to laugh at the dreams of humans which are draped like tattered clouds above their homes until sunlight bleaches them invisible
5910504 the things weve heard would not be just a statistic but rather a name and a face that weve seen and a hand that weve held

5910506 we were in the kitchen and colin went out for something and said what the hells all that noise
5910507 colin looked over the fence and could see him under the vehicle
5910508 its just lucky we arrived home at the right time
5910509 we wonder how people will be able to implement this legislation in the future when the intent of the changes is not very clear and the drafting is so complicated
5910510 were saying we dont want this legal ambiguity to result in the fishing and aquaculture parts of the industry spending millions of dollars battling out every single decision in court
5910511 every individual application that has to be gone through will be challenged by the groups that i represent until this matter is properly recognised
5910512 there are several possibilities none of whom have finally said yes i can do it given their work commitments and were hoping one will eventually emerge and the board will agree
5910513 i would have roger at number one however the board made the decision that it was better to have roger at number three and make it clear that he was coming to parliament rather than create a controversy over his list position
5910514 while people want a change of government i think theres a significant number of people who want a change of direction as well
5910515 i am not going to campaign to new zealanders on a moderate pragmatic agenda and then sell out to them on a radical right wing agenda
5910516 yes on the basis of his radical right wing agenda
5910517 we want to make the trials less about credibility and more about culpability
5910518 we should pause before we take away further rights of defendants
5910519 it should be for the state to prove the defendant intended to go ahead knowing there was no consent
5910520 before we send somebody away for 20 years we do want the crown to prove it beyond reasonable doubt we dont want someone on a crusading mission

5910524 the crown princess and crown prince became aware that there were photographers who had taken photos
5910525 they asked them not to use these photos and the photographers said ok fine
5910526 just to make sure that everything was ok i called three weeklies in denmark the three magazines that were present at the time and asked them if they would please not use those photographs
5910527 two said of course they would not but the third said they would
5910528 every summer the queen hosts her family her sisters and their husbands and children and grandchildren
5910529 the highlight of that event is the royals invite the press to come and take some pictures of the whole family
5910530 when the press show up at this event there is no frederik and mary when the queen is asked why theyre not there she says they are stuck in traffic
5910531 clearly what happened was that frederik and mary decided to boycott this event because the editor went ahead and published these pictures
5910532 it would have been tempting but its not the case the two incidents had nothing to do with each other
5910533 they were simply late because of a misunderstanding about the exact time of the photo session

5910578 most people have never heard of a two headed turtle
5910579 it looks like they searched the entire store and they could not find the turtle
5910580 i guess this qualifies as a missing turtle report but i dont think were out there looking for it
5910581 in the wild they would have zero chance in captivity most die within a few days of birth
5910582 they were trying the best they could but the turtle was just starting to waste away it wasnt feeding properly
5910583 they dont have the ability to dive and swim the way a normal turtle will if they are put into deep water they will actually drown
5910584 yep i knew it i had a dream about fish the other day
5910585 hes a 45 mile per hour couch potato a large cat
5910586 everyone expects him to be real hyper but he is very laid back and naps a lot
5910587 he carries his blanket around and cuddles up with it i can just lie right on top of him and he doesnt mind hes just really loving and social
5910588 i got my first impression of the parish from the first confession i heard here i thought i had been assigned to a terrible place the very first person that entered my confessional told me he had stolen a television set and when stopped by the police had almost murdered the officer he had stolen money from his parents embezzled from his place of business had an affair with his bosss wife taken illegal drugs and gave vd to his cousin i was appalled but as the days went on i knew that my people were not all like that and i had indeed come to a fine parish full good and loving people
5910589 ill never forget the first day our parish priest arrived
5910590 in fact i had the honour of being the first one to go to him in confession
5910591 we lived for days on nothing but food and water
5910592 i stood back and listened to what people were saying about it and they were really happy
5910593 there were farmers communicating and chatting to people they didnt know and it was a great family day without anyone having to put their hands in their pockets
5910594 it was a great success and now im thinking about what could be organised next year
5910595 we just thought wed come to clare for the day for a drive we stopped at olssens and knappstein wineries and had a lovely lunch in the bakery the pies were awesome and wed bought a bottle of wine
5910596 but we hadnt had much to drink at all i dont believe in drink driving
5910597 we think it rolled but neither of us can remember and i just closed my eyes
5910598 when it stopped we both climbed out of the drivers door
5910599 i think this is an insult to the council if we were to try to operate a service sa counter here it would become a shambles

5910619 needs to figure out if hes going to let rush limbaugh and the right wing of his party direct his choice

5910626 the point simply is that you had a certain set of wrong policies which culminated into a situation where the whole movement which started for a separate status in 1950 its journey has been towards separatism but i think even today any country worth its salt is going to allow its territory to be compromised with and india shall not under any circumstances compromise with its territory

5910638 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5910639 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5910640 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
5910641 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
5910642 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
5910643 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
5910644 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
5910645 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
5910646 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
5910647 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
5910648 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
5910649 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people

5910654 you hit a hurdle about twice a year where it affects your race
5910655 its just a shame that it happened on the biggest race of my life
5910656 about the middle part of the race the hurdles were just coming up very fast its kind of like a car when you race in a car and youre going max velocity and you hit a curve you either maintain control or you crash and burn and today i crashed and burned
5910657 i am shocked and sad i did such an amazing job this year but in the hurdles you have to get over all ten its very hard right now itll be harder tomorrow
5910658 i just wanted to get through comfortably being out there im kind of blind so i dont really know how fast i need to be going i just really wanted to run a decent turn
5910659 coach ford and michael johnson both wanted me to work on the first 200 like i did yesterday
5910660 i worked the turn a lot better today i was able to shut it down with 50m to go it was a real good time with the way i ran im excited about thursday
5910661 i knew where i was at in my training and i knew what i could do i was just out there to qualify run a good time and work on some things for the final i did everything that i wanted to and im real impressed with the way i ran today
5910662 georgia is a very modern normal country with very interesting people like americans that are being battered and butchered

5910665 only now theyre beginning to show some pictures of the destruction
5910666 i thought about my youth about my speeches in the 80s the solidarity rallies

5910729 while we have found and fixed many of our own bugs as well as flaws in other open source projects we realize that the discovery of additional security issues in a system this large and complex is inevitable
5910730 we do appreciate and encourage responsible disclosure especially since android will be deployed on many different devices that will require a large amount of coordination to patch
5910731 help from security researchers in the form of usable bug reports and responsible timelines will greatly assist us in securing the ecosystem of android devices as quickly as possible

5910815 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5910816 the best way to trap the criminal is to become like them
5910817 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5910818 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5910819 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5910820 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5910821 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5910822 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5910823 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5910824 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5910825 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5910826 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5910827 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5910828 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
5910829 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
5910830 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
5910831 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
5910832 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5910833 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5910834 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5910835 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5910836 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5910837 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5910838 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5910839 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5910840 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5910841 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5910842 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5910843 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5910844 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
5910845 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
5910846 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
5910847 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
5910848 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
5910849 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
5910850 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
5910851 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
5910852 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
5910853 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
5910854 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5910855 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5910856 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5910857 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5910858 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5910859 results were significantly affected by further declines in the us housing market where housing starts fell 35 per cent in the first quarter compared to the same period last year
5910860 our main businesses operated in markets that were affected by downturns particularly in the us where the downturn was the most severe
5910861 despite this we continued to focus on driving primary demand for fibre cement products in north america with strategies aimed at increasing our share of the us siding and backer board markets
5910862 although we expect our volume to remain below prior year as a result of a continuing decline in housing markets we expect our differentiated product strategy will allow us to maintain selling price and increase market share
5910863 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5910864 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5910865 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5910866 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5910867 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5910868 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5910869 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5910870 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5910871 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5910872 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5910873 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5910874 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5910875 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5910876 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5910877 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5910878 i feel very very fit but i still have a long way to go
5910879 i think that will come with match practice and in the next three weeks i am looking forward to getting back to a certain level that is comparable to where i was in the past
5910880 its much better now i can still feel it but i can bend my knee all the way back
5910881 were a couple of steps away from where i was four years ago
5910882 but we have shown a couple of times weve been up there
5910883 with dahle flesjaa not yet back to strength veteran margarita fullana of spain took the world championship title this year her first in eight years and the sydney bronze medalist will be seeking to capitalize on her good form
5910884 canada has always had a really good history in mountain biking
5910885 we maybe dont have the depth but the riders that we do bring to international competition are usually in the running
5910886 there is a strong connection to mountain biking in our culture much more than say track or road especially where these riders are from in the mountains it is the culture there
5910887 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5910888 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5910889 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5910890 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5910891 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5910892 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5910893 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5910894 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5910895 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5910896 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5910897 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5910898 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5910899 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5910900 weve seen these isolated reports about people having connectivity issues with 3g and edge and frankly i have those issues on a variety of phones
5910901 we have already made many improvements to mobileme but we still have many more to make
5910902 we know that mobilemes launch has not been our finest hour
5910903 the fact that apple is not dependent on the windows vista operating system hasnt hurt either
5910904 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
5910905 targeting u s and other nato forces and afghan forces have become larger and bolder and they include direct almost conventional style attacks
5910906 in late 2006 and into 2007 there was a much greater reluctance among the taliban and other groups to carry out these conventional style attacks
5910907 they clearly believe they are winning now and its caused them to be a bit more audacious
5910908 heartfelt thanks for the sacrifice that they are making and the commitment that the french are making to help secure afghanistan
5910909 theres really very little doubt that theyve been successful at that
5910910 commitment to carry on the fight against the criminal hordes until their elimination
5910911 we support the government of algeria as best we can in trying to fight this
5910912 the college presidents who have signed onto this initiative know that some young adults drink they just do
5910913 and with the law the way it is we have to be enforcers were not in a position where we can have a good open conversation with students about drinking responsibly safely and in moderation
5910914 far more teens die in alcohol related incidents than in those caused by all the other illicit drugs combined
5910915 lowering the drinking age to 18 will only make the situation worse
5910916 its becoming more and more the outlaw in this conflict
5910917 they intend and probably still do intend to strangle georgia and its economy
5910918 with every commitment to leave and with every failure to live up to that commitment the international pressure will grow on russia
5910919 a country relies on the word of its president being its bond
5910920 the only other possibility that exists is someone who went down there who didnt sign up
5910921 he says it wont solve our problem and that its quote not real hes wrong and the american people know it
5910922 americans across our country are hurting as we all know because of the cost of energy
5910923 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families now as we prepare for the winter its time for us to be more serious about our home heating oil needs and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
5910924 we need to drill offshore and we need to do it now if i were president i would call congress back into session and tell them to get to work

5910930 while our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the western powers rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of bio fuel
5910931 but we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic

5910977 i dont even remember i was very young when i wrote those letters and i havent seen these letters in years if you find them please send them over
5910978 regardless of which way you look at the situation we have to focus on ourselves
5910979 its focusing on within not from without when you start focusing outside you lose sight on what you need to think about working on and expend your energy the wrong way if you play the game hard everything else will take care of itself
5910980 we go out there and play the same way every day whether its the royals yankees as whatever
5910981 thats the way we go about our business thats one of the keys to our success for sure

5910991 i think it will be ok were both grown women both professionals once we were working it felt like a good fit
5910992 although its not something jamie lynn is discussing we all have our doubts that their relationship is solid definitely if not for two month old daughter maddie jamie lynn would have had enough of the stress of this relationship by now
5910993 we all really do hope this relationship can turn out well that it can be the fairy tale jamie lynn wants well have to see

5910996 blackbird is one of the most poetic visceral new plays to hit the scene in years
5910997 certainly ray is an ideal role for bill to flex his theatrical acting chops and to reintroduce to local audiences the magnetic presence that he demonstrated so ably in his early days on chicagos stages playing morally questionable characters in i n the belly of the beast the night of the iguana and flyovers ten years ago here at victory gardens

5911042 there were already imbedded rebels in the villages which was why the milf penetrated kolambugan
5911043 we strongly oppose this scheme because it is virtually devoid of any consultation with the philippine government industry stakeholders and most especially with the filipino migrant workers groups and overseas contract workers who will be greatly disadvantaged by the proposed onerous scheme
5911044 it would certainly spawn the abhorrent practice of contract substitution to the detriment of ofws
5911045 at this point this is a labor issue and not yet in the jurisdiction of the dfa
5911046 will government turn a blind eye and deaf ear to the onslaught and clear
5911047 defense of the filipino overseas contract workers whose rights interests and welfare will be put at risk by the impending implementation of the unified contract
5911048 to take the moral high grounds and show our genuine concern for the rights and welfare of the ofws we deploy because their problems and concerns are our concerns as well
5911049 strong determined decisive action in unison with government and industry stakeholders is the battle cry of the day to protect our ofws as well as other migrant workers from other labor exporting countries

5911058 we havent given up the whale is still healthy we will try again to encourage it back out to deeper water
5911059 we are seeking help and advice of international experts including seaworld in san diego to see if there are any additional techniques or options we can try this is a unique difficult and sad situation
5911060 weve tried this morning to lure the whale out this morning but it has failed she said
5911061 we havent given up on the whale a spokeswoman told aap
5911062 its not impossible and the fact it is snuggling up to a boat is a good sign it could be done
5911063 and the fact it has never been tried before in the world is a good reason to do it
5911064 all your are doing is dealing with a mammal that needs to be fed
5911065 this recasts our entire development assistance relationship with these countries on one core principle mutual responsibility
5911066 well continue to support these countries in a co operative framework but on the condition that we see measurable improvement over time in the key development indicators
5911067 on other critical barometers of economic development therefore we can either simply stand to one side and say thats the way things are or we can try and do something about and certainly our resolve is to do something about it

5911075 when we arrived the basket was actually arcing off with the transformer and i think their saving grace was they had an electrician that was actually a passenger
5911076 he was well aware of what electricity can do so i think their saving grace was that he got them out safely
5911077 theres a couple of people from canada french speaking people there was a couple of people from the gold coast and there was a small child a six year old child
5911078 i dont think they realised how close they came to going to see their maker
5911079 i think the shock was just starting to set in on them they have been transported back to their accommodation
5911080 if the haters who said i wasnt a real journalist are still lurking

5911082 if communicating is talking thats what we have been doing at practice as we go forward i dont know i dont foresee anything changing if it does its in his court
5911083 its a tough situation especially when you come into a working environment
5911084 but my job is to stay professional im going to do what im supposed to do
5911085 at the beginning of camp i hadnt asked for a trade
5911086 if im not going to be treated fairly if my hard work and loyalty isnt going to be rewarded here then let me go somewhere where its going to be rewarded thats how i feel
5911087 honestly i think it should be completely separated i think thats why we have a department that deals with that
5911088 i feel the exact same way about anquan he is a good football player the cardinals have extended his contract once tried to do it again and our intent is to do it the first chance we get

5911097 im a guy that does the right things on and off the field im not worried about my reputation being tarnished for me telling the truth
5911098 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
5911099 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
5911100 a key drug uptake transporter called oatp1a2 involved in shuttling drugs from the small intestine to the bloodstream
5911101 blocking this transporter reduces drug absorption and neutralizes their potential benefits
5911102 by contrast drugs whose levels are boosted in the presence of grapefruit juice appear to block an important drug metabolizing enzyme called cyp3a4 that normally breaks down drugs
5911103 i dont think well have him for the year but i think hes going to make it back to 100 percent which i think for a while was a little bit questionable
5911104 you dont want to rush him back who knows hes missed a lot of football as times goes by it becomes increasingly apparent to us its probably better to let him rest get his knee back underneath him for us and for him
5911105 this is the first summer that weve had this many reported to us
5911106 we havent necessarily seen any trend in the crime or any commonalities
5911107 bikes have been taken sometimes in the day sometimes in the evening
5911108 we put in the search criteria and they go and search pawn shops and sites like ebay and craigslist to see if the criteria that we put in there matches anything that they are finding in terms of what people are selling on those sites
5911109 and i dont need my ears on a spinning trapeze
5911110 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted toward men with genetically similar odours
5911111 it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odour perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
5911112 like children who learn a new language more easily than adults so too did the cats and dogs learn their new language more easily the younger they were
5911113 an analogy can be drawn with homes in which a dog is adopted either before or after a baby is born
5911114 when the dog enters a home with a baby in residence the status quo is already in place however when the baby is born after the dog has become accustomed to a certain amount of attention and the focus now turns to the newborn child the status quo is altered and the dog will often display behaviour resembling jealousy
5911115 its basically a comet but it never gets close enough to the sun to develop a long bright tail of evaporated gas and dust
5911116 it could have formed like pluto in the belt of icy debris beyond neptune then been kicked a large distance by a gravitational encounter with neptune or uranus
5911117 one of our goals is to understand the origin of comets which are among the most spectacular celestial events but the deeper goal is to look back into the early history of our solar system and piece together what was happening when the planets formed
5911118 almost everything people have discovered in these surveys has nice circular orbits around the sun
5911119 there are only three or four like this one that have elongated orbits that are currently known
5911120 weve seen this one at its closest encounter for every one we see there must be hundreds 240 billion kilometres away
5911121 what you know about numbers isnt just encoded in your language its much more than that
5911122 in our view there are some very basic number competencies that are encoded in the genome in some way
5911123 just like you and i inhale oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide these bugs breathe in arsenic iii and breathe out arsenic v
5911124 the move to the modern form of breaking up water molecules was the biggest move
5911125 the more pieces we add the more we understand which ones are missing
5911126 the most interesting trend is in methane concentrations from south to north
5911127 in the wet season there is a significant increase in methane once we get into the tropical areas in the north of the country
5911128 you dont have to worry about the dna going haywire
5911129 we can currently generate up to a 100 billion red blood cells from a single six well plate of stem cells
5911130 the ability to on demand make as much as you want is obviously very very attractive
5911131 we have copied nature taking the elements and mechanisms found in plant life that have evolved over three billion years and recreated one of those processes in the laboratory
5911132 when you take water and start to oxidise it you get radical matter that is very reactive and destructive and generally kills off the catalyst
5911133 weve hit on something thats stopped that side of the reaction
5911134 it was very surprising that these subjects would still have cells floating in their blood so long afterward
5911135 the antibodies that we isolated are remarkable antibodies they grab onto the virus very tightly and they virtually never fall off
5911136 that allows them to kill the 1918 virus with extreme potency meaning it takes a very small amount of antibody
5911137 the thought is the first influenza that you see during life is the one that you have the best immunity to
5911138 if we can learn the rules about how these antibodies work we may be able to design antibodies to lots of other viruses
5911139 this study tells us that human beings can make long lasting immune responses to bird influenza
5911140 in taiwan air pollution is a very serious problem in the city
5911141 we would need an air compressor to refuel most likely at a fuelling station
5911142 we dont think its a viable product because youre talking about a very very limited amount of compressed air you can put on a bike
5911143 we have a vehicle that will address that market but its not a motorcycle
5911144 the good thing is you could put a compressed air station on campuses in malls
5911145 you dont have the security situation that you do with gasoline
5911146 the concept is to take a gene whose product will prevent the mite from completing its life cycle
5911147 i strongly suspect there is no single gene that youll be able to pull in like that
5911148 the central role played by the murray darling basin in australian agricultural production is unlikely to continue much into the 21st century
5911149 our ability to use less water is going up exponentially every 10 years
5911150 i have no doubt that were in a particularly severe drought in the basin
5911151 to say that the situation were in now will be the norm in the future is not supported by the data
5911152 theres a high range of uncertainty but the majority of models say there will be less water in the south of the basin
5911153 agricultural business will have to adjust to that and i think the drought has accelerated that process of adaptation
5911154 we like most dairy farmers made the decision to sell our water at prices above 1100 per megalitre which enabled us to purchase three tonnes of dry matter per megalitre of water sold
5911155 in the future we will not return to wall to wall perennial pastures that require irrigating throughout the summer instead we will grow more annual crops and store the harvested silage and hay for use later in the year and in future years
5911156 if we did nothing to improve the efficiency of water use then by absolute laws of thermodynamics there will be less production if there is less water
5911157 there is a big margin for increasing water use efficiency economic growth in irrigated agriculture will come from improved efficiencies
5911158 add on the moves to secure water for the environment and the potential impact of climate change on water availability and it seems inevitable that there will be significant adjustment especially in the irrigation sector
5911159 weve been flying blind in the murray darling basin for 210 years because we dont have the data or knowledge to make good decisions
5911160 the issues are that there are different uses for the water and competing needs for that water between irrigators the environment and other uses
5911161 the sustainable yields project is one where we tried to quantify the state of the system in the event of climate change and different future scenarios
5911162 you only have long term sustainable production from any environmental system if it is healthy
5911163 a healthy river and a healthy regional economy are not polar opposites
5911164 a sustainable australian agriculture must be able to work in this old flat salty land driven by a highly variable climate this is a tough call
5911165 if conscious thinkers are given adequate time to encode material or are allowed to consult material while they deliberate their choices are at least as good as those made unconsciously
5911166 we know people can have difficulty keeping lots of options in their head at once youre better off acknowledging those limitations and seeking out strategies that will improve your decision making
5911167 if you have a choice and its tough list the options on paper try and come up with how important each option is to you and use what franklin called his moral algebra which is about weighing things up
5911168 for big purchase decisions some of the hard work of comparing attributes can be done now on consumer websites
5911169 i always thought that i hadnt earned the right to wear tights and shorts but now i see its strictly functional

5911172 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful

5911178 wax coated cardboard boxes for example used for packaging fruit arent recyclable
5911179 we have a different kind of process for separating the sugarcane into its component parts so that the lignin is still useful
5911180 it can be put back into the pulping process to make recycled paper
5911181 we also get the advantage of replacing a wax material from a petroleum resource a finite resource with biomass a renewable resource
5911182 we should bring it to the back and eat it no one will know
5911183 the purpose is to figure out how memories are actually stored in a biological brain
5911184 if we can understand some of the basics of what is going on in our little model brain it could have enormous medical spinoffs
5911185 within about 24 hours they start sending out feelers to each other and making connections
5911186 within a week we get some spontaneous firings and brain like activity
5911187 now we are looking at how best to teach it to behave in certain ways
5911188 this one is a bit boisterous and active while we know another is not going to do what we want it to
5911189 this is a simplified version of what goes on in the human brain where we can look and control the basic features in the way that we want in a human brain you cant really do that
5911190 the proposed mission sites at the lunar south pole dont have the visibility to earth that the apollo landing sites had
5911191 low elevation levels cause very poor visibility and if you happen to be in a crater there may be no visibility

5911209 in a brazen move against freedom of speech and against the chicago peace movement chicago police held peace activists at the 2008 chicago air and water show inside a fenced off free speech zone as one police officer termed it
5911210 until recently activists who assembled at the air and water show could assemble and interact with other attendees unimpeded however in the 2008 show activists were ordered to remain within the confines of the free speech zone roughly eight feet away from the sidewalk and on a hard to walk on sandy surface police said that individuals who left the free speech zone would be arrested
5911211 how on earth am i going to edit this thing
5911212 youve made a wonderful film i just wish it wasnt about me
5911213 if he likes the whole thing it probably wont be a very good film
5911214 in your transcendent present state of eternity you god are before all past time and after all future time since the future is still to come and when it comes it will be past but you are ever the same and your years wither not your years neither come nor go but ours do come and go so that all may file by
5911215 when a history of the past is truly related the memory does not bring back the events themselves which have gone out of existence but the words describing them and these words were taken from the senses as the events left on them a print of their passage
5911216 perhaps we can say that there are three tenses but that they are the present of the past the present of the present and the present of the future this would correspond in some sense with a triad i find in the soul and nowhere else where the past is present to memory the present is present to observation and the future is present to anticipation

5911238 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5911239 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5911240 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5911241 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5911242 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5911243 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5911244 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5911245 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5911246 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n

5911249 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5911250 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n

5911258 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5911259 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5911260 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5911261 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5911262 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5911263 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5911264 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5911265 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5911266 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5911267 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5911268 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5911269 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5911270 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5911271 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5911272 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5911273 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5911274 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5911275 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5911276 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5911277 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas

5911284 it makes more sense to have the main search word first then secondary search words thus i recommend utah utah history utah economy utah geography
5911285 the difficulty with this use of colons in titles is that they subtly enshrine

5911290 we cant simply leave a whole bunch of unverified data
5911291 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
5911292 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
5911293 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
5911294 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
5911295 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5911296 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5911297 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5911298 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5911299 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5911300 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5911301 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5911302 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5911303 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5911304 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5911305 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5911306 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5911307 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5911308 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
5911309 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
5911310 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
5911311 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
5911312 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
5911313 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
5911314 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5911315 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5911316 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5911317 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5911318 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5911319 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
5911320 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
5911321 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
5911322 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
5911323 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5911324 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5911325 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
5911326 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
5911327 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
5911328 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
5911329 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
5911330 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
5911331 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
5911332 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
5911333 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
5911334 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
5911335 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
5911336 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
5911337 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

5911341 in order to reduce the amount of work that had to be completed the day of the announcement the campaign had maintained a generic email that only required the name of the pick to be filled in
5911342 but when the name of the pick now known to be indiana senator evan bayh was filled in the aide working on the email accidentally pressed the send button rather than the intended save button
5911343 i want somebody who has integrity whos in politics for the right reasons i want somebody whos independent somebody whos able to tell me you know mr president i think youre wrong on this and heres why
5911344 share my passion someone whos mad right now that people are losing their jobs and mad that people are seeing their incomes decline and wants to rebuild the middle class in this country
5911345 i want somebody who is capable of being president who i trust
5911346 renowned for her managerial skill the discipline she demands from those around her and her tight control of all things labour undertakes under her leadership
5911347 she holds generally left wing beliefs with foreign policy perspectives forged during the vietnam war she does not trust those outside a small circle in labour and her chief of staff heather simpson is known as the second most powerful person in nz known as h2
5911348 i thought it was quite funny but as i say if i was to have my cvs on other leaders fall off the back of trucks you would all have a lot of laughs as well
5911349 i am a bit surprised that dfat would draw up something that was clearly written about the time of the last election there you go maybe they need to be more efficient
5911350 i think it is a pretty minor thing i had a bit of a laugh
5911351 if ofws persist in sending more money it will not be physically sustainable for them
5911352 give it one to one and a half years before we really feel the full effect
5911353 a large part of this increase has been simply to preserve the purchasing power of recipients since the philippine peso appreciated by 33 percent against the us dollar
5911354 we will have to repatriate him back to vietnam because he is on our watch list as persona non grata thai immigration cannot let him enter mr chatchawal said
5911355 he is still in the transit area at bangkok international airport he said
5911356 the doctor prescribed a painkiller and issued a certificate saying he is fit to travel
5911357 we need to control him and he will be controlled once he returns to this country
5911358 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5911359 i want gary glitter to be controlled whilst hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
5911360 we will have to repatriate him back to vietnam because he is on our watch list as persona non grata thai immigration cannot let him enter mr chatchawal said
5911361 he is still in the transit area at bangkok international airport he said news com au is not responsible for the content of external sites help sought for baby whale
5911362 this early it has become very apparent that the moa failed to bring stability to affected areas in mindanao the moa is obviously not the answer because of the numerous objections it encountered from the people in mindanao and the negative effects it created now
5911363 we agreed to let the sc decide first otherwise we will be divided
5911364 will protect the territorial rights of the country as well as the rights of the people in mindanao
5911365 and the moa will not establish those fundamentals in the region
5911366 this is not yet a war these are just pocket incidents we should be clear on that
5911367 there is nothing happening in cagayan de oro or caraga region
5911368 right now the situation is still normal but we are continuously monitoring the situation
5911369 they are trying to ensure teams present themselves in the best possible light i understand where the rule comes from but to suspend players is wrong
5911370 theres not enough natural gas theres not enough renewables such as wind and solar energy to go around so im not concerned that coal is going to disappear for us not to use that resource we are just shooting ourselves in the foot
5911371 theres a perception out there that coal is dirty and we have to change that
5911372 adds a significant amount of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere per unit of heat energy more than does the combustion of other fossil fuels
5911373 may mga 80 to 90 percent na mga pilipino na gustong makakuha tayo ng medalya sa sports
5911374 kami ang may accountability sa bayan kung nakikita namin na hindi tama iyong patakbo ng nsas hindi namin bibigyan ng isang kusing tapos na ang kabaitan namin gobyerno ang nagbibigay funds pero ang may responsibilidad sa mga atleta nsas din
5911375 kung kailangan mag roll ng heads dapat gawin for the good of the country sama sama kami ang tanong diyan kapag natanggal ang tao maso solve ba ang problema kung maso solve dapat umalis na iyong tao kung kailangan ang ulo ko walang problema
5911376 baka magkaroon ng maliit na allocation iyong ibang sports iyong focus sports malaki iyong mga nsas na hindi sumusunod problema na nila kung paano makakakuha ng pera hindi puwedeng walang mangyayari dahil may responsibidad kami sa bayan
5911377 wala namang masaya kasi wala tayong medalya kung titignan mo ang performance ng ating atleta hindi masama pero tignan mo ang singapore at malaysia talagang nag invest sila sa sports
5911378 the manner in which people undertook the un march was a kashmiri referendum against india the people have given their verdict that indian occupation is not acceptable under any circumstances
5911379 the international community must accept the referendum of the kashmiri people and must come forward to help the kashmiri people at this critical juncture to resolve the kashmir issue
5911380 india is busy in dividing and creating confusion among kashmiris through its paid agents and people must beware of these conspirators to foil indian designs
5911381 indian rulers must take the referendum as the writing on the wall because in no case will the kashmiri people accept indian hegemony any longer
5911382 india will have to give up its obduracy and intransigence and come out with sincere and concrete steps to resolve the kashmir issue
5911383 the better way out for india is to respect the aspirations of kashmiris

5911424 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5911425 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5911426 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
5911427 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
5911428 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
5911429 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
5911430 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
5911431 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
5911432 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
5911433 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
5911434 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
5911435 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
5911436 ukteyi x diye biri y civarinda vermis bir de not dusmus demis ki z bilmem ne
5911437 the president took the correct decision in the final movements and saved pakistan from a disastrous situation
5911438 the resignation is in the interest of pakistan and kashmir because pakistan was unable to focus attention on the kashmir issue during its political crisis now it can be hoped that the government there will focus on the situation in kashmir
5911439 it is unfortunate that the central government did not give a positive response to the former pakistan presidents proposals on kashmir which held up further progress
5911440 id always juggled a ball since i was young but it was about three years ago that i started football freestyle doing tricks its an online competition where you place videos on youtube he said
5911441 when i went to the first audition they wanted someone who could remove their clothes except underpants while juggling the ball i didnt think i had much chance i was called back and there were even more people being tested
5911442 this time they asked for a special trick i caught it in my undies first go what else i did was my own idea i was hoping i might get a side part initially i was surprised when i got the main role
5911443 when i have a long session like that ill take the next day off he said
5911444 its something i might be able to teach people when i finish school ive certainly been giving it a lot of thought
5911445 i am not a noted goalscorer but ive been involved in a lot of assists i enjoy that he said

5911455 the garment business is very quiet people are cutting overhead cutting expenses theyre sending fewer people to the show
5911456 theres a huge pressure on beds there are huge demands on the system
5911457 what were seeing is that patients are sicker theyre more acute theyre more medically unstable but theres continuous pressure to get patients admitted treated and out
5911458 if we had more supportive housing for people with long term mental illness it would free up a significant number of the beds that we would say are blocked
5911459 it indicates to me that theres a changing way that hospitalization or stays in a hospital are being used for people with a mental illness
5911460 on the west side of anniston the poor side of anniston the people ate dirt
5911461 then the birth of all my blogs began i continue to read and learn a lot from shavars blog for i feel like he is a big brother with him sharing lots of wonderful advice on life meem com so we both tend to share and learn about new web technologies that are introduced to us

5911463 for the blind instead of being ostracized socially the dog draws people to interact with them
5911464 i hate dog talk baker does this baker doesnt like that baker is very sensitive when it comes to males wearing hats talking about the dog as if the dog were a person or a part of the family i like the dog to be a dog
5911465 sometimes if we go somewhere with a back garden and the other person has a male dog the dogs tend to get into pissing contests and baker may piss on a plant that might be one the hosts like
5911466 the hostess was a strict cat person the other dog was running around chasing her cat and at the end of the night the dog left a giant turd right in the middle of her kitchen
5911467 i made him go back and fish it out and throw it in the woods
5911468 i began wondering if i could survive jumping out of the plane into some body of water
5911469 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5911470 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
5911471 higher than analysts predicted but the lowest level in more than 17 years nonetheless
5911472 comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
5911473 a plutocracy that will stand regardless of who wins the next few elections
5911474 in a day when senator barack obama the presumptive democratic presidential nominee has amassed more than 340 million in campaign contributions half of which came from donations of 200 or less and recently became the first major party candidate to reject public financing in the belief that his campaign could raise 200 million to 300 million for the general election such observations seem not only dubious but antiquated as well
5911475 indeed he has a record number of small donors with some 45 percent of his campaign cash coming from contributions smaller than 200 which is a great percentage but its only eight points better than john kerry in 2004 and only 14 points better than george bush that same year in truth obama is still raising tons of money from big corporate donors
5911476 not only did obama not show up to vote he appeared at a public forum three days later flanked by jon corzine and robert rubin two former goldman sachs executives to discuss how to revive the economy here you have the basic formula of campaign contributions in a nutshell powerful investment bank gives big money to candidate needed reform requires candidate to cross said investment bank candidate pussies out and finds way to be gone at the moment of truth candidate resurfaces later in arms of aforementioned investment bankers
5911477 obamas absence on oil speculation was eerily reminiscent of his previous decision to change his mind about giving retroactive immunity to telecom companies for spying on americans obama withdrew his pledge to filibuster the immunity bill right around the time the democrats announced that at amp t would be sponsoring the democratic convention so no filibuster on retroactive immunity from the top democrat but convention goers in denver will get tote bags emblazoned with the at amp t logo so thats something
5911478 obama also supported the freddie mac fannie mae rescue and that too is no surprise given that he hired one former chairman of fannie mae to chair his vice presidential vetting panel and hired another former fannie mae chairman to serve as his consultant on housing issues most of us will never get within a hundred miles of a single fannie mae chairman but obama has already hired two and he isnt even president yet
5911479 the iranian regime supports violent extremists and challenges us across the region it pursues a nuclear capability that could spark a dangerous arms race and raise the prospect of a transfer of nuclear know how to terrorists its president denies the holocaust and threatens to wipe israel off the map the danger from iran is grave it is real and my goal will be to eliminate this threat
5911480 finally let there be no doubt i will always keep the threat of military action on the table to defend our security and our ally israel
5911481 i couldnt get the money here i couldnt get the money in britain i went to everybody you wouldnt believe the number of producers based in europe and in the states that i went to

5911580 this story is a new version of an old classic a story of southern justice gone awry
5911581 nina simone sang about it william faulkner wrote about it historians teach about it a young man in his 30s imprisoned in a florida jail cell in 2003 for what not giving millions of dollars to deceitful plaintiffs and dishonorable lawyers in a civil suit to satiate the avaricious appetite of a cavernous court a court that rewarded the licentious acts of the wayward plaintiffs and their lawyers with illicit imprisonment and a coerced settlement under duress perpetrating a continuous perversion of justice

5911633 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5911634 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5911635 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5911636 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5911637 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5911638 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5911639 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers

5911644 the critical issues we did have were all corrected as the inspector went through we always try to turn those around within 24 hours or less
5911645 it really makes you feel like you are doing things right
5911646 george bushs record as a student military man businessman and leader of the free world is one of constant failure and the part that troubles me most is he seems content with himself he will leave office with the country 10 trillion in debt fighting two wars our international reputation in shambles our government cloaked in secrecy and suspicion that his entire presidency has been a litany of broken laws and promises our citizens faith in our own country ripped to shreds yet bush goes bumbling along grinning and spewing moronic one liners as though nobody understands what a colossal failure he has been i fear to the depth of my being that john mccain is just like him
5911647 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5911648 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5911649 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5911650 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5911651 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5911652 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5911653 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5911654 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5911655 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5911656 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5911657 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5911658 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5911659 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5911660 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5911661 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5911662 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5911663 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5911664 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5911665 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5911666 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5911667 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5911668 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5911669 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5911670 george bushs record as a student military man businessman and leader of the free world is one of constant failure and the part that troubles me most is he seems content with himself he will leave office with the country 10 trillion in debt fighting two wars our international reputation in shambles our government cloaked in secrecy and suspicion that his entire presidency has been a litany of broken laws and promises our citizens faith in our own country ripped to shreds yet bush goes bumbling along grinning and spewing moronic one liners as though nobody understands what a colossal failure he has been i fear to the depth of my being that john mccain is just like him
5911671 i dont know about you but i wish they would have used red brick on the exterior
5911672 you see your status as secretary of state of the usa is fast becoming as pathetic as your status as national security advisor was back in the days of 9 11 when you failed to provide any security whatsoever for your people

5911682 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5911683 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5911684 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5911685 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5911686 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5911687 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5911688 even with the change in catalog system grpl will remain a member of the lakeland library cooperative and will continue to share resources with other libraries who are members of the cooperative

5911696 kenoi stated that upon walking up to the bar he remembers accidentally bumping into a woman at the bar
5911697 kenoi stated that he never threw a punch or kick and that he never tried to hit anyone
5911698 at this time i asked kenoi if he had ever head butted the male party in the bar kenoi said no i asked him if he knew the male party he said he did not i asked him if he had thrown a chair at any time in the bar he said absolutely not i then asked kenoi which way he left the bar he said that he walked out the back door of the bar
5911699 he said that as he got to the bar it was very crowded
5911700 he stated that at this time all hell had broken loose and guys started shoving bumping and pulling
5911701 he stated that knowing that deleted was sitting as an advisor to the mayor he told deleted that they should leave at this time they both exited the bar and there were several other fights outside also they tried to break up these fights
5911702 deleted stated that after they tried to break up a couple of fights outside they then went into the bar and he exited thought the back door with deleted
5911703 he also stated that he did not see the male party get punched by rat heyward he said that he knows who rat is and that rat was not with them that evening he said that rat was sitting with some other male parties at a table
5911704 latika grabel stated that she just got off work and drove all the way to hilo to be with her husband they were deleted at that time she stated that they her husband and she just got to shooters bar and grill and walked up to the bar
5911705 she stated that she just ordered a drink from the bartender who she described as being a female party when somebody pushed her
5911706 she stated that she had bruises on her back from this fall and they took pictures of it on the next day at home
5911707 t he male party then grabbed joshua by the back of the head and smashed his head
5911708 she stated that at that time a couple of other guys came up and one of them punched her husband on the side of his head
5911709 she stated that at that time the security guard grabbed her husband took him out of the restaurant and they were not doing anything to the other male party
5911710 dont call the cops well give you your money back
5911711 she stated that she believed she was looking the other way when all of a sudden she started to get pushed she said that she looked around and did not see latika she said that experience told her that a fight was happening so at that time she left the immediate area and walked to the bathroom

5911713 equivalent of a charge but prosecutors asked for dismissal of both cases for lack of evidence the charges were dismissed
5911714 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5911715 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5911716 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5911717 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5911718 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5911719 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5911720 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5911721 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5911722 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5911723 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5911724 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5911725 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5911726 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5911727 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5911728 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5911729 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5911730 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5911731 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5911732 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5911733 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5911734 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5911735 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5911736 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5911737 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5911738 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5911739 this is a planning took where all things are going
5911740 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5911741 i dont know about you but i wish they would have used red brick on the exterior
5911742 diet sodas are much more attractive than your usual soft drinks simply because the label says
5911743 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5911744 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5911745 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5911746 alas must it ever be so do we stand in our own light wherever we go and fight our own shadows forever
5911747 the jewish people as a whole will be its own messiah it will attain
5911748 great strength of thought and insight its design is well above the abilities of an ordinary mind it is more complicated than a nuclear bomb
5911749 promised themselves that in less than a century they would be the masters of the world
5911750 freemasonry is fundamentally jewish exclusively jewish passionately jewish from the beginning to the end
5911751 someday history will tell how all the revolutions of recent centuries originated in the masonic sect under the supreme command of the jews
5911752 these protocols are nothing else than a strategic plan for the conquest of the world presented to the council of the elders by theodor herzl at the time of the first zionist congress held by the world zionist organization in 1897 at basel switzerland
5911753 the only statement i care to make about the protocols is that they fit in with what is going on they are sixteen years old and they have fitted the world situation up to this time they fit it now
5911754 out of the temporary evil we are now compelled to commit will emerge the good of an unshakable rule which will restore the regular course of the machinery of the national life brought to naught by liberalism the result justifies the means let us however in our plans direct our attention not to what is good and moral as to what is necessary and useful our power in the present tottering condition of all forms of power will be more invisible than any other because it will remain invisible until the moment when it has gained such strength that no cunning can any longer undermine it before us is a plan in which is laid down strategically the line from which we cannot deviate without running the risk of seeing the labor of many centuries brought to naught
5911755 only force conquers in political affairs especially if it be concealed in the talents essential to statesmen this evil is the one and only means to attain the end the good therefore we must not stop at bribery deceit and treachery when they should serve towards the attainment of our end in politics one must know how to seize the property of others without hesitation if by it we secure submission and sovereignty
5911756 our international rights will then wipe out national rights in the proper sense of right and will rule the nations precisely as the civil law of states rules the relations of their subjects among themselves the administrators whom we shall choose from among the public with strict regard to their capacities for servile obedience will not be persons trained in the art of government and will therefore easily become pawns in our game in the hands of men of learning and genius who will be their advisors specialists bred and reared from early childhood to rule the affairs of the whole world
5911757 do not suppose for a moment that those statements are empty words think carefully of the successes we arranged for darwinism marxism nietzcheism to us at any rate it should be plain to see what a disintegrating importance these directives have had upon the minds of the goyim a slur against those who were not jewish
5911758 through the press we have gained the power to influence while remaining ourselves in the shade thanks to the press we have got the gold in our hands notwithstanding that we have had to gather it out of the oceans of blood and tears
5911759 to this end we have stirred up every form of enterprise we have armed all parties we have set up authority as a target for every ambition disorders and bankruptcy will be universal
5911760 we appear on the scene as alleged saviors of the worker from this oppression when we propose to him to enter the ranks of our fighting forces socialists anarchists communists to whom we will always give support
5911761 our power is in the chronic shortness of food hunger creates the right of capital to rule the worker more surely than it was given to the aristocracy by the legal authority of kings
5911762 by want and the envy and hatred which it engenders we shall move the mobs and with their hands we shall wipe out all those who hinder us when the hour strikes for our sovereign lord of all the world to be crowned it is these same hands which will sweep away everything that might be a hindrance thereto
5911763 this hatred will be still further magnified by the effects of an economic crisis which will stop dealings on the exchanges and bring industry to a standstill we shall create by all the secret subterranean methods open to us and with the aid of gold which is all in our hands a universal economic crisis whereby we shall throw upon the streets whole mobs of workers simultaneously in all the countries of europe
5911764 remember the french revolution to which it was we who gave the name of great the secrets of its preparations are well known to us for it was wholly the work of our hands
5911765 we shall create an intensified centralization of government in order to grip in our hands all the forces of the community we shall regulate mechanically all the actions of the political life of our subjects by new laws these laws will withdraw one by one all the indulgences and liberties which have been permitted to wipe out any unenlightened who oppose us by deed or word
5911766 we have set one against another the personal and national reckonings of the goyim religious and race hatred which we have fostered into a huge growth in the course of the past twenty centuries this is the reason why there is one state which would anywhere receive support if it were to raise its arm for every one of them must bear in mind that any agreement against us would be unprofitable to itself we are too strong there is no evading our power the nations cannot come to even an inconsiderable private agreement without our secretly having a hand in it
5911767 nowadays it is more important to disarm the peoples then to lead them into war
5911768 in order to put public opinion into our hands we must bring it into a state of bewilderment by giving expression from all sides to so many contradictory opinions and for such length of time as will suffice to make the goyim lose their heads in the labyrinth and come to see that the best thing is to have no opinion of any kind in matters political which it is not given to the public to understand because they are understood only by him who guides the public this is the final secret
5911769 by all these means we shall so wear down the goyim that they will be compelled to offer us international power of a nature that by its position will enable us without any violence gradually to absorb all the state forces of the world and to form a super government its hands will reach out in all directions like nippers and its organization will be of such colossal dimensions that it cannot fail to subdue all the nations of the world
5911770 we shall raise the rate of wages which however will not bring any advantage to the workers for at the same time we shall produce a rise in prices we shall further undermine artfully and deeply sources of production by accustoming the workers to anarchy and to drunkedness in order that the true meaning of things may not strike the unenlightened before the proper time we shall mask it under an alleged ardent desire to serve the working classes and the great principles of political economy about which our economic theories are carrying on an energetic propaganda
5911771 the intensification of armaments the increase of police forces are all essential for the completion of the aforementioned plans what we have to get at is that there should be in all the states of the world besides ourselves only the masses of the proletariat a few millionaires devoted to our interests police and soldiers
5911772 in a word to sum up our system of keeping the governments of the goyim in europe in check we shall show our strength to one of them by terrorist attempts and to all if we allow the possibility of general rising against us we shall respond with the guns of america or china or japan
5911773 our directorate must surround itself with all these forces of civilization among which it will have to work it will surround itself with publicists practical jurists administrators diplomats and finally with persons prepared by a special super educational training in our special schools
5911774 we have in our service persons of all opinions of all doctrines restoring monarchists demagogues socialists communists and utopian dreamers of every kind we have harnessed them all to one task each one of them on his own account is boring away at the last remnants of authority is striving to overthrow all established forms of order
5911775 we have fooled bemused and corrupted the youth of the goyim by rearing them in principles and theories which are known to us to be false although it is by us that they have been inculcated
5911776 above the existing laws without altering them and by merely twisting them into contradictions of interpretations we have erected something grandiose in the way of results these results found expression first in the fact that the interpretations masked the laws afterwards they entirely hid them from the eyes of the government owing to the impossibility of making anything out of the tangled web of legislation
5911777 the chamber of deputies will provide cover for will protect will elect presidents but we shall take from it the right to propose new or make changes in existing laws for this right will be given by us to the responsible president a puppet in our hands we shall invest the president with the right of declaring a state of war
5911778 not a single announcement will reach the public without our control even now this is already attained by us inasmuch as all news items are received by a few agencies in whose offices they are focused from all parts of the world these agencies will then be already entirely ours and will give publicity only to what we dictate to them
5911779 our wise men trained to become leaders of the goyim will compose speeches projects memoirs articles which will be used by us to influence the minds of the goyim directing them towards such understanding and forms of knowledge as have been determined by us
5911780 economic crises have been produced by us for the goyim by no other means than the withdrawal of money from circulation you are aware that the gold standard has been the ruin of the states which adopted it for it has not been able to satisfy the demands for money the more so that we have removed gold from circulation as far as possible
5911781 thanks to such methods paying interest on loans allowed by the carelessness of the goy states their treasuries are empty the period of loan supervenes and that has swallowed up remainders and brought all the goy states to bankruptcy
5911782 any form of taxation per head the state is baling out the last coppers of the poor taxpayers in order to settle accounts with wealthy foreigners from whom it borrowed money from the pockets of the poor to those of the rich
5911783 we have got our hands into the administration of the law into the conduct of elections into the press into the liberty of the person but principally into education and training as being the corner stones of a free existence
5911784 it is indispensable for us to undermine all faith to tear of minds out of the unenlightened the very principle of godhead and the spirit and to put in its place arithmetical calculations and material needs
5911785 when we come into our kingdom it will be undesirable for us that there should exist any other religion but ours of the one god with whom our destiny is bound up by our position as the chosen people and through whom our same destiny is united with the destinies of the world we must therefore sweep away all other forms of belief
5911786 in 1879 a new political and religious universal kingdom would be established and that it would be possessed by him who would have the keys of the east
5911787 when the hour strikes for our sovereign lord of all the world to be crowned it is these hands which will sweep away everything that might be a hinderance thereto ours they will not touch because the moment of the attack will be known to us and we shall take measures to protect our own ever since that time we have been leading the peoples from one disenchantment to another so that in the end they should turn also from us in favor of that king despot of the blood of sion whom we are preparing for the world
5911788 when the king of israel sets upon his sacred head the crown offered to him by europe he will become the patriarch of the world
5911789 the king of the jews will be the real pope of the universe the patriarch of an international church
5911790 i pass now to the method of confirming the dynastic roots of king david to the last strata of the earth the prop of humanity in the person of the supreme lord of all the world of the holy seed of david must sacrifice to his people all personal inclinations
5911791 certain members of the seed of david will prepare the kings and their heirs 0nly the king and the three who stood sponsor for him will know what is coming
5911792 unfit for military or auxiliary service too weak incapable of bearing arms
5911793 mandate which one day he would receive from the people to lead them out of servitude to the heights of freedom
5911794 in that hour it began the nazi movement known as national socialism
5911795 i believe that i am today acting according to the purposes of the almighty creator in resisting the jew i am fighting the lords battle
5911796 today i want to be a prophet once more if international finance jewry inside and outside of europe should succeed once more in plunging nations into another world war the consequence will not be the bolshevization of the earth and thereby the victory of jewry but the annihilation of the jewish race in europe
5911797 international jewry will be recognized in its full demonic peril we national socialists would see to that
5911798 we shall regain our health only by eliminating the jew
5911799 we know that hitler and his top luminaries were either dabblers in the occult or outright satanists
5911800 follow hitler he will dance but it is i who have called the tune i have initiated him into the secret doctrine opened his centres in vision and given him the means to communicate with the powers do not mourn for me i shall have influenced history more than any other german
5911801 be united united united this should be the uninterrupted call to the parties of the reichstag we hope that our words of today will work and will find the strong man who will finally bring everyone under one umbrella for he is always necessary for us germans as we have seen in the case of bismarck
5911802 germanys prosecution of the war would have been unthinkable and impossible
5911803 only until the german people had been freed from the threat of marxism and could reach a decision as to whether the final form of government would be a republic or a monarchy
5911804 a transitional stage leading to the reintroduction of the german monarchy
5911805 at the present moment more than a hundred american corporations have subsidiaries here or cooperative understandings the du ponts have their allies in germany that are aiding in the armament business their chief ally is the i g farben company the primary supporter of hitler standard oil company of new york sent 2 000 000 here in december 1933 and has made 500 000 a year helping germans make ersatz gas for war purposes but standard oil cannot take any of its earnings out of the country except in goods the international harvester company president told me their business here rose 33 a year but they could take nothing out even our airplane people have secret arrangements with krupps general motors company and ford do enormous business here through subsidiaries and take no profits out i mention these facts because they complicate things and add to war dangers
5911806 made at high level and for reasons beyond my field and knowledge
5911807 bring the central european and balkan countries under allied control before they were allowed to slip into red slavery
5911808 perfectly friendly they arent trying to gobble up the rest of europe these fears that have been expressed by a lot of people here that the russians are going to try and dominate europe i personally dont think there is anything do it i have just a hunch that stalin doesnt want anything but security for his country and i think that if i give him everything i possibly can and ask nothing in return he wont try to annex anything and will work for a world of democracy and peace
5911809 stalin was intent on creating favorable conditions for the realization of communist aims throughout the balkans and western europe he emerged as the only winner of the war we insured the emergence of a more hostile menacing predatory power than nazi germany one which has enslaved more people than we liberated
5911810 were doomed the united states is doomed the communists have control completely theyve got control of roosevelt and his wife as well
5911811 many many times in his letters to me jim forrestal wrote anxiously and fearfully and bitterly of the enormous harm that had been and was unceasingly being done by men in high office in the united states government who he was convinced were communists or under the influence of communists and who he said were shaping the policies of the united states government to aid soviet russia and harm the united states
5911812 i have in my hand 57 cases of individuals who would appear to be either card carrying members or certainly loyal to the communist party but who nevertheless are still helping to shape our foreign policy
5911813 here was signed the death warrant of the young men who were dying today in the hills and valleys of korea here was signed the death warrant of the young men who will die tomorrow in the jungles of indochina vietnam
5911814 the destruction of joe mccarthy leaves the way open to intimidate any person of consequence who moves against the conspiracy the communists made him their chief target because they wanted him a symbol to remind political leaders in america not to harm the conspiracy or its world conquest designs
5911815 picked roosevelt as a natural candidate for the presidency long before any other responsible politician
5911816 i was close to the movement that nominated roosevelt he has given me a free hand in advising secretary of state cordell hull all the ambassadors have reported to me frequently
5911817 seize the white house with a private army of 500 000 veterans hold franklin roosevelt prisoner and get rid of him if he refused to serve as their puppet in a dictatorship they planned to impose and control
5911818 war was largely a matter of money bankers lend money to foreign countries and when they cannot repay the president sends marines to get it
5911819 at the first meeting of the cabinet after the president took office in 1933 the financier and advisor to roosevelt bernard baruch and baruchs friend general hugh johnson who was to become the head of the national recovery administration came in with a copy of a book by gentile the italian fascist theoretician for each member of the cabinet and we all read it with care
5911820 the new president again turned to the possibility of war in japan
5911821 i know of no well informed washington observer who isnt convinced that if mr roosevelt is elected in 1940 he will drag us into war at the first opportunity and that if none presents itself he will make one
5911822 the american people should insistently demand that congress put a stop to step by step projection of the united states into undeclared war
5911823 sooner or later the japanese will commit an overt act against the united states and the nation will be willing to enter the war
5911824 that an american warship should find the prinz eugen the bismarcks escort ship then draw her fire thus providing the incident for which the united states would be so thankful i e bring her into war
5911825 the peruvian minister has informed a member of my staff that he heard from many sources including a japanese source that in the event of trouble breaking out between the united states and japan the japanese intended to make a surprise attack against pearl harbor
5911826 the japanese intend to attack pearl harbor in the next 60 days
5911827 the united states desires that japan commit the first overt act
5911828 war between the united states and japan will begin in the nearest future
5911829 war with japan will begin immediately exclude all possibility of a second port arthur
5911830 an incontestable fact in the true history of pearl harbor is the repeated withholding from admiral kimmel and general walter c short navy and army command in pearl harbor of supremely important military information theres never been a case in history when a commander was not informed that his country will be at war within a few hours and that his forces will most likely become the first object of attack at sunrise
5911831 while i am talking to you mothers and fathers i give you one more assurance i have said this before and i shall say it again and again and again your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars
5911832 if you adopt these policies the japan will commit an overt act of war
5911833 our intelligence data spoke of a likely attack by japan on the philippines or the dutch east indies although pearl harbor wasnt excluded from discussion everything relayed to us pointed to other objects of attack if we had known that the japanese were continually collecting detailed information about the exact location and movements of our warships in pearl harbor which is made clear by intercepted reports we naturally would have concentrated our efforts on preparations to repel an attack on pearl harbor

5911835 it was part of roosevelts plan that no warning be sent to the hawaiian islands our leaders in washington who deliberately didnt inform our forces in pearl harbor cannot be justified in any way the pearl harbor command wasnt informed at all about the american note of november 26 1941 delivered to the japanese ambassador which practically excluded further negotiations and made war in the pacific inevitable the army and navy command in the hawaiian islands received not even a hint about intercepted and deciphered japanese telegrams which were forwarded to concerned parties in washington on the 6th and 7th of december 1941
5911836 we dont like it and we didnt want to get in it but we are in it and were going to fight it with everything weve got
5911837 army and navy officials in washington were privy to intercepted japanese diplomatic communications which provided crucial confirmation of the imminence of war

5911954 a whole bunch of copies went out to the government
5911955 an obvious kind of presentism which at its worst becomes indoctrination by historical example

5911969 the radar will be capable of detecting ballistic missiles early in their flight and will provide precise tracking information for use by the combatant commanders

5911971 we greatly appreciate everything the hospital is doing for the community and all the help they are giving us in what we are trying to do

5912044 ghadir merupakan hari dimana allah swt akan menambahkan rizki terhadap orang orang yang beribadah pada hari itu
5912045 puasa pada hari ini sebanding dengan puasa selama enam ratus bulan
5912046 puasa hari ghadir khum sebanding amalan seratus haji dan seratus umrah di sisi allah swt
5912047 hari ini merupakan hari dimana allah swt mewajibkan ke atas seluruh orang orang beriman untuk menghormatinya lantaran pada hari ini allah swt menyempurnakan agama nya dan melengkapkan nikmat atas mereka dan mengulang janji serta akad yang diambil dari mereka semenjak awal penciptaan dan setelah itu mereka lupakan lalu memberikan taufik kepada mereka supaya mereka menerimanya dan tidak termasuk sebagai orang orang yang ingkar
5912048 sesungguhnya kami bani adam adalah orang orang yang lalai terhadap ini ke esaan tuhan
5912049 dimanapun kalian berada cobalah untuk merayakannya di sekitar haram hadrat amirul mukminin as karena tuhan pada hari ini mengampuni dosa dosa orang beriman selama enam ratus tahun dan melebihi dua kali pahala bulan ramadhan malam qadhar dan malam idul fitri yang membebaskan orang orang beriman dari neraka
5912050 s alam padamu wahai amin dan hujjatullah di muka bumi
5912051 barang siapa yang meminjam uang sehingga ia dapat membantu saudara mukminnya aku
5912052 hari ini adalah hari untuk mengenakan pakaian pakaian baru dan menepikan pakaian pakaian hitam
5912053 katakanlah sekiranya kalau bukan dua kalian tuhanku tidak akan memperhatikan kalian
5912054 kami adalah pecinta ali dan pecinta orang orang yang mencintai ali as sebagaimana engkau memerintahkan kami untuk mencintainya dan memusuhi musuh musuhnya
5912055 kriteria rasulullah saw dalam menentukan saudara untuk masing masing muslim kesesuaian derajat dan kualitas dan kedekatan derajat iman
5912056 aku mendengar rasulullah saw bersabda almarhum muhaddits qummi dalam kitab mafatihul jinan menganggap akad ukhuwah sebagai adab hari ghadir menulis
5912057 aku telah menjadi saudaramu karena allah dan aku telah memilihmu karena allah dan aku memberikan tanganku kepadamu karena allah dan aku mengikat janji kepada allah para malaikat para rasul nya dan para imam maksum as bahwa sekiranya aku menjadi penduduk surga dan mendapatkan syafaat dan memiliki izin untuk memasuki surga aku tidak akan memasukinya kecuali bersamamu memasukinya kemudian yang diajak berikrar dan berjanji mengatakan aku menerimanya
5912058 akh saudara artinya seseorang yang berasal dari sulbi dan rahim yang sama denganmu
5912059 setelah turun dari mimbar dan duduk di sebuah kemah khusus dan bersabda bahwa amirul mukminin duduk di kemah yang lain
5912060 ya rasulullah aku minta izinmu untuk mendeklamasikan syair di hadapanmu tentang ali as
5912061 para malaikat yang turun membantuku pada hari badar dan hunain mengenakan amamah seperti ini
5912062 barang siapa yang menghendaki dalil dari riwayat ini seolah olah menghendaki dalil kebenaran riwayat
5912063 hadits ini diriwayatkan oleh tiga puluh orang sahabat rasulullah saw sanad sanad hadits tersebut adalah sanad sanad sahih dan ibn maghazali dalam kitabnya
5912064 hadits ghadir adalah hadits sahih dimana kira kira seratus orang sahabat yang di antara mereka adalah orang orang yang mendapatkan berita gembira masuk surga
5912065 abu saad masud bin nasir sajistani menyusun sebuah kitab yang terdiri dari sepuluh juz yang bernama ad dir yah fii h adits al wil yah dan hadits ini ia riwayatkan dari seratus dua puluh sahabat
5912066 hadits ghadir tanpa syak merupakan sebuah kenyataan yang dengan sendirinya tidak akan pernah sirna
5912067 barang siapa yang menjadikan aku sebagai mawla maka ali adalah mawlanya orang orang yang ber istidlal bernalar dengan hadits ini memaknai mawla sebagai awla dan awla bermakna orang yang lebih layak untuk mengatur dengan ungkapan yang lebih sederhana adalah bahwa yang layak untuk membina dan memimpin dengan demikian makna hadits ini adalah barangsiapa yang menjadikan aku sebagai pemimpin dan pembinanya ali as adalah pemimpin dan pembinanya
5912068 barang siapa yang menjadikan aku sebagai temannya maka ali adalah temannya
5912069 barang siapa yang menjadikan aku sebagai penolongnya maka ali adalah penolongnya lantaran teman dan penolong tidak memerlukan adanya ucapan selamat pengenaan
5912070 demikian juga ahli bait as dan para pengikutnya dalam banyak hal berdalil dan berdebat dengan menggunakan hadits ini
5912071 barang siapa yang menjadikan aku sebagai mawlanya maka ali adalah mawlanya allahummah cintailah orang yang mencintainya dan musuhilah orang yang memusuhinya
5912072 barang siapa yang menjadikan aku sebagai mawlanya maka ali adalah mawlanya
5912073 mengapa ali tidak menyerahkan kepada kita orang yang membunuh utsman
5912074 wahai muawiyah jangan engkau berdalih dengan darah utsman engkau adalah orang yang mengejar kekuasaan dan pemerintahan apabila engkau ingin membantu utsman sebenarnya engkau dapat membantunya pada masa hidupnya akan tetapi engkau berdalih atas darahnya kematian utsman engkau sangat dahaga kekuasaan hingga ia terbunuh
5912075 wahai abu hurairah lalu mengapa engkau bersahabat dengan musuhnya dan memusuhi orang yang bersahabat dengannya
5912076 aku ingin bertanya mengapa engkau mecintai ali dan membenciku engkau menerima wilayahnya dan memusuhiku
5912077 apabila mungkin engkau membolehkan aku untuk tidak menjawab pertanyaan itu
5912078 aku bersumpah kepada allah bahwa apakah engkau mendengar rasulullah saw bersabda
5912079 ali yang menyebabkan utsman terbunuh dan aku adalah khalifah utsman
5912080 barang siapa yang menjadikan aku sebagai mawlanya maka ali adalah mawlanya
5912081 sekarang berikan kepadanya lima puluh dinar pada saat terjadi perdebatan antara makmun dan ishaq bin ibrahim hakim agung pada masanya tentang keutamaan sahabat sahabat nabi saw makmun bertanya kepadanya
5912082 menurutmu apakah hadits ini menetapkan kewajiban yang harus ditunaikan oleh abu bakar dan umar di hadapan ali atau tidak
5912083 mereka berkata nabi menyampaikan hadits ini tatkala terjadi perbedaan antara ali dan zaid bin haritsa
5912084 barang siapa yang menjadikan aku sebagai mawlanya maka ali adalah mawlanya
5912085 apakah nabi saw menyampaikan hadits ini pada saat kembalinya dari makmun berkata
5912086 wahai ishaq anda tidak menerima perbuatan pemuda lima belas tahun akan tetapi menerima perbuatan rasulullah saw celakalah engkau mengapa engkau menyembah para fuqahamu
5912087 rabigh adalah sebuah belantara antara bazwah dan juhfah yang dilintasi oleh para haji
5912088 with this increased inflammation more than it showed last time our doctors have recommended that he pretty much rest some more
5912089 how much time we dont know were not going to put a specific time on it but billy will be not activated
5912090 i dont see how i could go out there and help the team
5912091 i dont think i could pitch effectively to begin with or come back and pitch the next day
5912092 i want to play i want to compete theres only so much time in a career and i want to get out there and help my teammates were in a great situation right now were leading our division and we got a great chance to go to the playoffs you want to be a part of that and so for me im very frustrated
5912093 you must make a lot of money working on wall street
5912094 what time do you get off work when can i call you
5912095 so if i call you around four thirty that would be ok
5912096 i extracted some hair from the alleged corpse and examined it and had some concerns
5912097 we burned said sample and said hair sample melted into a ball uncharacteristic of hair
5912098 within one hour we were able to see the partially exposed head
5912099 i was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm but unusually hollow in one small section this was yet another ominous sign
5912100 within the next hour of thaw a break appeared up near the feet area i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
5912101 erics not the kind of guy who lets the grass grow under his feet
5912102 it took me some time to make readers realise i wasnt making a comedy manga this time
5912103 i always wanted to create a manga with a fateful story or with emotional scenes
5912104 my story in a way automatically develops according to the characteristics of the characters
5912105 so i have never got bored with depicting inuyasha and his elder half brother sesshomaru
5912106 things like world conquest do not mean very much to me
5912107 isnt a desire to tenaciously pick on a romantic rival easier to understand
5912108 it is the character of naraku that he prefers destruction to control and wants everybody dead although he might have just wanted to be loved by someone at heart
5912109 since reality is much more harsh i just think i cant forgive the culprits of brutal cases since people in a weaker position always become the victims
5912110 i still dont know what i should do with kagome in the end
5912111 my story in a way automatically develops according to the characteristics of the characters
5912112 i didnt think the depiction was too racy i just made it i sketched about 10 kinds of hairstyles and costumes and finally decided on what i thought best
5912113 i first regarded lum as a guest character i didnt think she would be so popular
5912114 i just felt everything became possible in manga and people began to read manga openly and fairly compared to the time when i made my debut
5912115 i didnt know how to draw girls manga so i asked my assistant how to do it
5912116 i want to stick to manga for primary middle school and high school students as long as there are readers
5912117 i began to receive a lot of fan letters from girl readers around when i began to draw ranma they sent me a lot when i began drawing inuyasha too i want boys read more in my next work
5912118 also all microsoft has to do is stop releasing updates or security patches and xp users will have to move to mac or linux downgrade to vista
5912119 every good omnivore should try at least once in their life
5912120 we never went out during the time we were training
5912121 our school is quite strict when we stay in school we cant go out on our own let alone when were at a military camp
5912122 north korea is no 1 in the world when it comes to uniformity they are uniform beyond belief these kind of traditional synchronized movements result in a sense of beauty we chinese are able to achieve this as well through hard training and strict discipline
5912123 in one week we could only work four and a half days we had to have coffee breaks twice a day couldnt go into overtime and just a little discomfort was not allowed because of human rights
5912124 you could not criticize them either they all belong to some organizations they have all kind of institutions unions we do not have that we can work very hard can withstand lots of bitterness we can achieve in one week what they can achieve in two months
5912125 at one point the children had to run in four different directions when one fell others quickly followed
5912126 we had only two meals for the entire time there was almost no time to sleep even less time for toilet breaks
5912127 but we didnt feel so angry because the director was also there with us the whole time
5912128 all the tears the sweat and sometimes even blood that we shed i now think it was quite worth it
5912129 when we performed that night all that i could feel in my heart was joy pure joy

5912152 we expect that once we complete our development program these tests will help improve the outcomes of at risk pregnancies it is a powerful example of our commitment to provide clinical laboratories with the tools that improve patient health and reduce the cost of care our expectations for diagnostic testing related to maternal and fetal well being leads us to believe that buying out our u s royalty obligation will create substantial value for our shareholders
5912153 broken bread provides food and other critical supplies to thousands of fond du lac area individuals each year and its very important that they continue to do so
5912154 the alliant energy foundation wants to support broken bread and help the group get back into full operation as quickly as possible

5912161 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5912162 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5912163 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
5912164 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
5912165 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
5912166 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
5912167 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
5912168 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
5912169 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
5912170 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
5912171 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
5912172 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
5912173 a website is window into the hearts and minds of the marketplace and there is an
5912174 give me an example of a time when someone made an unreasonable request of you what did you do
5912175 abrir investigaci n contra mandatarios que apoyan a las farc para que la corte penal internacional cpi haga lo propio
5912176 instamos a la fiscal a general de la naci n para que inicie las investigaciones penales contra los mandatarios y funcionarios extranjeros cuyas pruebas determinen que han apoyado de m ltiples maneras a la guerrilla narcoterrorista de las farc
5912177 para cometer cr menes de lesa humanidad y de guerra
5912178 cobijados por un fuero especial gracias a su cargo que impide judicializarlos en tribunales ordinarios
5912179 si bien dicha comunicaci n no es una amenaza contra el gobierno colombiano s es un claro indicio de que la corte ya est analizando el caso de colombia con el fin de abrir una investigaci n contra algunos de los protagonistas de nuestro conflicto por la comisi n de cr menes de lesa humanidad
5912180 integrates its own undoing into the terms of its ongoing argument
5912181 i dont even feel im the best at bar a
5912182 are we the team of 2006 that made it to the nfc championship game or are we the team that last year didnt live up to our expectations well we think were the team of 2006 but weve got to go out there on the field and prove it and weve all got to do our job to get to that level thats the goal
5912183 we got to the nfc championship and naturally you just think the next step is the super bowl guaranteed were there
5912184 we had an edge in 06 a little chip on your shoulder with everything that was going on in the city post katrina then last year after the slow start i felt there were some guys that lost confidence and you lose a little confidence and all of a sudden youre in such a deep hole we were never really able to dig ourselves out of it
5912185 we got back to 500 on two occasions but never really got over the hump when are we at our best when we have that edge
5912186 were looking for an overall improvement not one guy thats going to put us over the top its how we can help ourselves in every area
5912187 you can say its the preseason and its going to be ok but i thought defensively we were poor
5912188 weve got to do a better job starting with the coaches myself and the people on that side of the ball
5912189 i thought it would come a little quicker but it hasnt gotten to that point where im just firing off and doing what i need to do
5912190 thats still coming for those two years i was locked in a 3 4 now im trying to switch gears
5912191 im very frustrated but theres not much for me to do
5912192 i want to play i want to compete theres only so much time in a career and i want to get out there and help my teammates were in a great situation right now were leading our division and weve got a great chance to go to the playoffs and you want to be a part of that
5912193 its a dangerous area it is in the elbow it is in the tendon
5912194 we didnt expect to have more swelling today you expected to have less swelling and the fact that you have more swelling thats a concern and thats why if it goes that route we have to be more careful and be more conservative
5912195 well just try to match up the best way we can
5912196 the thing i want to be careful of at this stage of the season is anointing someone as that person and then that doesnt work out
5912197 i do not necessarily determine the role the relief pitcher determines the role
5912198 im considering everybody from the gulf coast league to triple a can any of yall throw
5912199 the reality is true proven guys are not going to get through
5912200 i feel comfortable that the answer when billys not here is in that room
5912201 the guys in there are going to have to step up i think weve got the guys
5912202 were not the only team that goes through this and we have to find a way to get it done
5912203 theres a lot of guys who have come out and havent done much
5912204 then you have older guys who have been at the position six or seven years thats done a lot for his team and the league and the young guy comes in making more money than him at the position
5912205 when you see guys who have never taken a snap in the league make twice as much as guys who have been to three and four pro bowls thats not right
5912206 were dealing with such short careers with our players if you entered into some type of scale it wouldnt make any sense in our business
5912207 i understand it i have a lot of respect for veterans in this league who have been around for many years and deserve to be compensated
5912208 at the same time for me its the system i came into and i cant be concerned about that stuff
5912209 more than anything the nfl owners focus on limiting rookies in the next cba is motivated by a desire to pit player against player and is part of a divide and conquer strategy
5912210 also all microsoft has to do is stop releasing updates or security patches and xp users will have to move to mac or linux downgrade to vista
5912211 at a seminar students entering the room for lunch found a sign on the buffet table that said take only one apple
5912212 we zullen hem moeten terugsturen naar vietnam omdat hij op onze lijst van persona non grata staat
5912213 de immigratiedienst van thailand laat hem het land niet binnen
5912214 with the fifth generation frc q micronas is building on the success of its proven trud technology
5912215 our technology raises the bar for picture quality at full hd resolution and provides the perfect solution for 120hz and 240hz lcd tvs
5912216 i believe this notion of understanding user intent being able to analyze search queries and come up with search patterns and use them to shape the search experience is one of the most important areas for us
5912217 if we come again and again with innovation that matters we will have the opportunity to grow our volume and our share
5912218 we made decent progress but we have a ways to go
5912219 we think that tech natural language processing is going to be a very critical way for us to improve relevance further at scale
5912220 these are the domains where we have domain specific task oriented
5912221 hi julie this is tracy from daycare how are you
5912222 well he isnt wearing any underwear one of his socks is inside out and his shoes are on the wrong feet
5912223 it took me a while to let things go you just have to work through that stuff it takes a few years divorce is really awful a lot of people go through that more than once and i dont know how they do it i mean once was enough for me
5912224 were in this time when you have to be young and pretty weve gone back to that
5912225 there were a lot of people 10 or 15 years ago who were putting on funny clothes and playing some kind of country music who were dabbling
5912226 blue mountain was really authentic they were blending country blues and rock in an interesting way that only two or three bands were doing
5912227 it was one of the most happening places culturally in the country
5912228 fat possum records was based there so you had r l burnside and junior kimbrough and all those guys and oxford had this literary scene with larry brown and barry hannah there was a lot going on and we were kind of musically in the center of it
5912229 theres probably going to be periods of time where im probably not going to be making enough money from music and ill have to get an additional job
5912230 i mean thats how things have changed before we sold enough records and we made enough money on the road where we could really not worry about that for a while live show attendance has been up and down for everybody not just for us weve been lucky because we still have the markets where we did really well and were still doing really well but that could go away too
5912231 i have to say the one thing im glad to see is were also picking up some younger fans people who have heard of the band but never seen us or heard about us from their older brothers and sisters because if we were just playing to our old fans those people are like in the 30s and 40s now so theyve got kids you know theyre not packing the clubs anymore
5912232 i think its going to be fun and it really really feels good to be doing it again
5912233 frank and laurie are great friends one of the things that i thought about it was it was kind of unfinished business we kind of went out with a sigh more than a bang we want to come back and write another chapter
5912234 obviously being pushed back is not what i want but at this juncture it needs to happen
5912235 thats what were trying to stay away from anytime theres something wrong with your arm a baseball player especially a pitcher you think of the worst first ive been kind of reassured by people that its not that
5912236 he slept on his arm the other night and he came in and felt some tingling in his fingertips
5912237 as far as pain goes its not that much pain at all with it its something weve monitored over time it hasnt ever festered until now
5912238 its what i do a part of my life since i was born
5912239 i enjoyed abc a great deal i just look forward to working
5912240 theyre the more traditional pretty boy positions the talkers michael and i are breaking the rule
5912241 nbc analysts tiki barber and jerome bettis tell me ill lose a friend a week doing this but ive only had three friends my whole life so im good
5912242 when we put a live bug on to report corrections and clarifications contact reader editor
5912243 when a man is in love and turned on by his wife he is also totally entranced by the feminine beauty of her body regardless of where the media would rank it on a scale of one to ten
5912244 we had previously highlighted the potentially negative earnings impact from fertiliser cost the risk of biofuel policies reversing and the risk of the sector de rating
5912245 the current consolidation in palm oil price sparked off by a fall in crude oil price adds to the negative outlook
5912246 do you think players literally should hold out on a trade until they get their bonus money
5912247 i think the bcs formula is so good they ought to take it to basketball baseball tennis and golf and make them go through it
5912248 ive never understood why were the only sport in the world that doesnt have a playoff
5912249 one of the very good things about the bcs is its preservation of bowl arrangements as a reward system for players
5912250 lets remember that the players are the ones who carry the whole system
5912251 it doesnt mean the formula is perfect and weve got everything figured out
5912252 but the fact that people are feeling compelled to tune into college football every saturday means weve done something right
5912253 hes a pure drop back passer with a nice sense of timing placing the ball in tight spots and he does not hold onto the football
5912254 this year hell play quarterback because hes simply the best player on the team but everybody realizes hes not a quarterback in college
5912255 he blends excellent size vision balance and most of all production hes a power back
5912256 when you come up with a plan to rush the passer youre ahead of the game in high school
5912257 hes big has exceptionally long arms and very quick feet
5912258 he weighs 275 yet looks real thin because hes got room to grow hes a natural at tackle
5912259 hes the ronnie lott of this years class he has brilliant speed but he loves to hit and is excellent in coverage

5912267 have you ever heard any brewer thank the judges no they name beers most beer judges are boneheads
5912268 to second guess the mind set of a young man in the heat of battle four years later and to put the question in a civilian court system that cant even remotely comprehend the battlefield is shameful for this government
5912269 while not acknowledging that any part of the governments case is true the fact is the military sent these people out to do a job and kill everything that moved in a city where there were no good guys left
5912270 when you look at the lifetime prevalence rates those are alarming statistics
5912271 we really need to keep rescuing those in need but we need to be shifting some of our focus on building resilience to ever engage in these thoughts
5912272 from this moment a decree of expropriation is in effect and the job stability of workers is guaranteed by the venezuelan state
5912273 according to a press release issued by petroleos de venezuela s a pdvsa pdvsa will proceed to take operational control of the plants of cemex venezuela
5912274 the mexican government has formally informed venezuela of its support for the companys request to continue negotiations
5912275 continue negotiations based on the principles of dialogue non discrimination compromise and openness
5912276 i think there is still room for negotiation we are not at the point of no return
5912277 the cemex case is very complicated but the numbers which we are using for it are close to the governments offer
5912278 at sidor production has fallen some 25 percent neither has there been progress in the belt
5912279 i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president without knowing necessarily what hes doing i wont have my vice president engineering my foreign policy for me
5912280 the buck will stop with me because ill be the president
5912281 my vice president also by the way will be a member of the executive branch he wont be one of these fourth branches of the government where he thinks hes above the law
5912282 i want somebody who has integrity whos in politics for the right reasons
5912283 i want somebody whos independent somebody whos able to tell me you know mr president i think youre wrong on this and heres why
5912284 i want somebody who is capable of being president who i trust
5912285 im a big believer in winning i dont intend to lose this election john mccain doesnt know what hes up against right now
5912286 we had a vigorous campaign senator clinton ran a historic campaign
5912287 senator obama opposes new drilling he said it wont solve our problem and that its not real he is wrong and the american people know it
5912288 the important first step for the international cricket council was gaining recognition of the sport and of the council from the ioc
5912289 that is important particularly for many of our smaller nations because to belong to a sporting body that has recognition from the ioc improves their opportunity for funding
5912290 it is something that cricket has to think about very carefully
5912291 this visit these few days give us the opportunity to assess the potential for cricket becoming an olympic sport
5912292 2020 must be the earliest realistic date but i must emphasise the international cricket council has to consider its position just as the ioc has to consider its position
5912293 cricketers wont care about the money the chance to stand on top of the olympic podium to wear an olympic gold medal and the pride of belting out your national anthem would be a life changing experience
5912294 can i start you folks off with a plate of our famous guacamole
5912295 no thanks i think were all set to order honey why dont you start
5912296 i think i want the original steak fajitas but i have a question
5912297 no theres no fat on the steak at all its a great cut
5912298 you also get your choice of beans with that refried or black
5912299 they use them every day what about in restaurants you cant get a drink without a straw in restaurants
5912300 well yeah but thats just restaurants i mean people dont keep them in their houses they dont use them at home
5912301 yes they do my mom keeps them in her house my friends have them i keep them in my apartment why else would they sell them in the supermarket
5912302 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5912303 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5912304 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5912305 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5912306 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5912307 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5912308 it is always good to go out of these kinds of matches with a win i am happy physically because i am fine coming out of this match
5912309 i am definitely thinking the body is not holding as well as it used to
5912310 thats a fact and it is pretty frustrating but that is the way it is
5912311 it is good to have matches before a grand slam
5912312 i needed to return better and i didnt i didnt make enough serves when i needed
5912313 sir those are whippets the greyhounds are over here behind the building
5912314 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5912315 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5912316 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5912317 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5912318 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5912319 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5912320 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5912321 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5912322 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5912323 who are open to doing something on the production side
5912324 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5912325 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5912326 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5912327 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5912328 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5912329 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5912330 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5912331 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5912332 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5912333 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5912334 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5912335 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5912336 give drink to those who are thirsty and feed the
5912337 probably eaten by one of the many bats we see flying around the pool after dark
5912338 transformar a cultura da degrada o em uma cultura do saber cuidar
5912339 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5912340 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5912341 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5912342 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5912343 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5912344 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5912345 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5912346 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5912347 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5912348 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5912349 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5912350 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5912351 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5912352 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5912353 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5912354 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5912355 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5912356 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5912357 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5912358 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5912359 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5912360 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5912361 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5912362 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5912363 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5912364 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5912365 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5912366 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5912367 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5912368 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5912369 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5912370 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5912371 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5912372 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5912373 he stabbed one of the schoolkids in the neck and he died he then went further and stabbed a gardener in the back and another gardener in the face they were taken to hospital in serious conditions
5912374 a woman who is with a man who has interests that dont revolve around her
5912375 i dont even like poker but bill sounded really down on the phone and i think he wants to talk
5912376 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5912377 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5912378 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5912379 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5912380 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5912381 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5912382 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5912383 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5912384 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5912385 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5912386 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5912387 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5912388 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5912389 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5912390 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5912391 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5912392 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5912393 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5912394 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5912395 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5912396 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5912397 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5912398 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

5912409 in an environment of higher oil prices lower consumer spending and tighter lending standards the global inflation challenge is forcing exporters to choose between raising prices and risking customer backlash or absorbing the additional costs their business is facing

5912440 sejak pukul 07 00 sampai pukul 10 00 masih ada beberapa mobil berpelat pejabat katanya sih orang orang penting dia masih coba coba parkir saya sih tidak menegur nanti patroli gabungan saja yang menindak mereka kan sudah tahu kalau dilarang parkir dan nanti jika peringatan tidak digubris pasti digembok oleh petugas gabungan
5912441 kami sudah siap mengefektifkan aturan penggembokan itu hari ini selasa 19 8 red namun polanya tetap melalui teguran dan imbauan terhadap pengendara atau pemilik kendaraan itu kami akan catat dulu dari teguran pertama dan kedua jika masih membandel kami tidak menegur pengendara dan langsung menindak
5912442 ini sudah puncaknya kami harus makin tegas mau tidak mau harus diberlakukan sanksi yang tegas di lapangan kami akan melakukan pengekleman mengunci atau menggembok mobil mobil yang seenaknya itu sudah sulit hanya dengan peringatan saja sejak sepekan lalu kami sudah layangkan surat untuk izin dan aturan penggembokan itu ke administratur bandara padahal kami sudah berikan sosialisasi tentang aturan parkir
5912443 kami tidak ingin ada ekses yang harus kami terima dari orang orang yang justru berlaku tidak tertib di bandara padahal kami sudah menyediakan kartu pas atau parkir gratis untuk kendaraan berpelat khusus tindakan tegas juga harus dilakukan karena terkait keamanan ketertiban dan kenyamanan bandara yang sudah masuk kategori internasional tidak mungkin contoh yang buruk dan suasana yang tidak nyaman berlanjut

5912497 without price improvement productivity initiatives were not sufficient to fully offset general inflationary cost pressures
5912498 the economic environment is uncertain and a changing competitive dynamic in the paint sector in australia will be further compounded by the introduction of imported paint by a major corporate retailer
5912499 given the changes that are occurring in the marketplace and the uncertain economic environment in which we are operating including no anticipated improvement in the housing sector it is too early to take a view on how the 2008 09 year will progress

5912512 for the mind set on the flesh is death but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace 7 because the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward god for it does not subject itself to the law of god for it is not even able to do so 8 and those who are in the flesh cannot please god

5912534 tenemos m s chinos comiendo m s indios comiendo m s africanos comiendo y m s brasile os comiendo
5912535 todo esto es tratado por la prensa como si fuera una crisis y se le vende al mundo como si fuera una crisis
5912536 sin ninguna arrogancia o autoimportancia los brasile os necesitamos tomar lo que para otros es una crisis como una extraordinaria oportunidad de transformarnos realmente nosotros mismos en el granero del mundo como mucha gente desde hace mucho tiempo pronostic
5912537 sin duda alguna hay potencial para producir si el gobierno no se atraviesa en el camino
5912538 nosotros ni siquiera vamos a pronunciar la palabra ayuda si el gobierno no pone obst culos a o tras a o generalmente el productor est incrementando la producci n
5912539 si nos referimos a la parte central de brasil todav a hay much simas reas no explotadas por eso no tengo dudas
5912540 lo que hemos visto en los diez ltimos a os es una revoluci n silenciosa en nuestro pa s principalmente en la producci n agroindustrial

5912548 si tenemos el adecuado flujo de inversiones para la log stica la infraestructura la tecnolog a y el desarrollo de la tierra el pa s puede aumentar dos y medio hasta tres veces su producci n real en los pr ximos diez a os
5912549 desde luego tenemos aumentos de productividad que podr an venir de europa ee uu canad y argentina
5912550 pero donde uno encuentra las mejores condiciones para dar a la sociedad mundial la mejor tasa de retorno en t rminos de inversi n es en brasil

5912774 just to have 12 people come forward search for the truth and have everything come out thats really really an important part of our constitution
5912775 she is not only a daughter of hawaii but is also a product of uh manoa so she does us proud in many ways im confident she will be a terrific leader of our new school of hawaiian knowledge
5912776 to bring together hawaiian language and culture to bring together the ontology of indigenous knowing allows us to make a more significant impact on the education of children today and seven generations to come
5912777 allow this to be a wakeup call for hawaii and the rest of the country
5912778 we now have two grieving families who have to grapple with the devastating and destructive effects of mental illness and it is our hope and prayer that no others should have to confront this issue in the painful manner we have had to
5912779 we are concerned that children arent getting services and the families arent getting access the services they need
5912780 in fact it is stronger than it has ever been so far
5912781 it might not register that its really land at this point
5912782 there clearly cannot be any question of impartiality on his part
5912783 they can always hurt you more but they cannot stop the clock
5912784 five years ago when we were first starting out wed autograph shirts and say start your own band about books
5912785 we just wanted to present a different idea of what a band could be
5912786 we wanted to play music that you wouldnt normally see on the tv or the radio
5912787 we werent thinking we would create a wizard rock movement it just evolved
5912788 but its cool to see bands about books realized in some way
5912789 some people dont like twilight potentially becoming the new harry potter theres a lot of groaning and moaning about the movie coming out and the fact that there is twilight music kind of bothers some people
5912790 twilight is sort of like the hannah montana of literature
5912791 if youre outside the 14 to 16 year old age range you might listen to it and it might get stuck in your head but its not good literature its not really enriching your life the way harry potter might
5912792 love is never going to get old and if you can find new ways to talk about love you can find new ways to write about twilight but i dont think twilight is as powerful as harry potter is twilight is about love and being a teenager and wondering if you fit in and harry potter is that and so much more
5912793 for us its a community not so much a genre of music and i dont know if they have a community yet if they all get together if the bands are as close as all of us are
5912794 i dont think it could have a movement on its own
5912795 but wizard rock can expand to be bands themed about other books it doesnt just have to be about harry potter anyone who is singing about any book can be part of wizard rock
5912796 when i raise my flashing sword and my hand takes hold on judgment i will take vengeance upon mine enemies

5912798 maddow didnt get here by bluster and bravado but with a combination of crisp thinking and galumphing good cheer remarkably this seasons discovery isnt a glossy matinee idol or a smooth talking partisan hack but a ph d rhodes scholar lesbian policy wonk who started as a prison aids activist
5912799 you want to know who theyre blaming for women voters breaking for hillary clinton over barack obama
5912800 theyre blaming chris matthews people are citing specifically chris not only for his own views but also as a symbol of what the mainstream media has done to hillary clinton
5912801 i didnt mean it in a mean way at all
5912802 but i knew that it was just going to blow his mind
5912803 trying to do it as if im keith isnt the best way to go
5912804 and i feel like ive got a learning curve thats like the matterhorn holy mackerel
5912805 you mean when i started working on aids in prisons was this where i thought it would end up yeah this is pretty much it phase forty seven of my master plan
5912806 i knew like two women total who were doing treatment activism and i didnt totally get it im not like barbie math is hard but it was a techie world and i didnt feel like i could be all that helpful
5912807 wicked expensive and wicked stupid and also mean so lets make the hospices get what they want and also do the right thing
5912808 and i have no interest in new england hate winter dont like the country not fond of animals
5912809 as it turned out it worked out for them i mean i hope it did i hope theyre happy
5912810 we hope and expect to have her continue hosting a radio show on air america for a long time
5912811 if oreilly hannity and beck can do that so can i
5912812 weve seen the potential for greatness in rachel for years
5912813 whats so remarkable is that now its coming so quickly this election cycle has propelled it forward in a meteoric fashion
5912814 but his war policy stuff now is bullshit its total bullshit and ive never been impressed by it one or two brigades a month you want your son to be in the last brigade
5912815 i have never and still dont think of myself as an obama supporter either professionally or actually
5912816 liberated by having a professional role in which its probably better for me not to take sides
5912817 she wants to talk about aids in prison and the constitution and the war in iraq policy is her main focus not winning elections
5912818 im fascinated by the evil child actor twins that run poland
5912819 how many bails of hundred dollar bills does it take to buy bread today in zimbabwe
5912820 thats the most satisfying thing about being able to do my own story selection
5912821 you get to pick that stuff and whoever is president or in control in congress is not going to affect that
5912822 i love the idea that i am the voice of woman
5912823 look at me its like really the one woman in the room is really mannish
5912824 the only reason i get these opportunities is because of my sensibility
5912825 im not being invited to do these things because of my looks or my facility with language what theyre after is the thing youre saying i have to trade off
5912826 muxtape will be unavailable for a brief period while we sort out a problem with the riaa
5912827 no artists or labels have complained the site is not closed indefinitely stay tuned
5912828 so youll see a difference in vocals a little bit more personality and its definitely a sensual album
5912829 i definitely think that when i first heard the song from the beginning of the record you kind of feel like you know im leaving it up to you
5912830 and by the time it gets to the second verse and makes it to the end of the song it just feels like im saying i dont want to put up with it anymore
5912831 it was a great first single for me because it said something i fell in love with records like beyonc s irreplaceable where you could emotionally attach yourself to the record as soon as you heard it
5912832 i didnt want something so vague and so clubby because i wanted people to see me as a woman with something to say
5912833 i would say that an official girl is someone in a relationship
5912834 youre attentive youre honest but at the same time you can let go a little bit
5912835 you must make a lot of money working on wall street
5912836 what time do you get off work when can i call you
5912837 so if i call you around four thirty that would be ok
5912838 ce idee buna cu educatia tinerilor si eu am vrut sa fac asa ceva dar nu am bani
5912839 i might have been able to come back but i might have lost by 10 shots but i would have liked to play that second day to see if i could have done better
5912840 i didnt get to see the course and get a feel for it
5912841 there were a lot of bunkers protecting the greens you have to play target golf because theres not a lot of room for error
5912842 at the worlds i just couldnt get the ball out there far enough and i couldnt follow through
5912843 only a half to a third of the medication was actually absorbed
5912844 the best thing would be to take your medication with water two hours before consuming fruit juices to prevent or reduce the chance of this drug interaction
5912845 i think that this is the tip of the iceberg
5912846 i think that there may be many other types of foods that could also possibly cause an interaction
5912847 if we had done it any earlier i dont think we would have reached the pinnacle that were reaching now
5912848 smith received an undergraduate degree from auburn and a law degree from the university
5912849 i stopped into target today since i was on that side of town running errands and to my surprise there was new stuff
5912850 went to target today and they have everything but the marine naturals line i bought one of everything well almost
5912851 guess what i got tonight the new pomegranate tea candle love it i then headed over to the tea isle and bought some pomegranate tea i dont even like tea but figured if it smells that good it must taste even better but please dont eat the candle already tried that here
5912852 we dropped our gun belts and stripped down and we all just went into the water

5912855 theres other names up there that are just astounding some of our favorite artists and politicians
5912856 but its going to be really cool to see that in 10 years 20 years from now
5912857 a lot of kids feel lonely when they first get diagnosed with diabetes im just so encouraged at the end of the day because all im trying to do is make it through another day managing diabetes
5912858 theyre just doing the same thing were all there for each other
5912859 we run around onstage constantly for about an hour and 45 minutes and we know what that can do you just feel great at the end of the night and when you wake up in the morning
5912860 but now its been more constructed its just going to be called j o n a s and is going to be us dealing with trying to take out the trash and not get hounded by fans its going to be a funny show
5912861 i feel like its better not for us to dwell on that type of thing it could only go wrong
5912862 weve all been playing in bands for a very long time with little or no success depending on how you define that but the fact is that we went into this with only one ambition to have a good time and for us being able to still do that is really all thats important
5912863 we do like the thought of trying to be the best band in america
5912864 i mean who really knows who the best band is i dont thats for sure so for us striving to be really good at what we do and trying to have a good time thats the fun part everything else is just a little beyond us
5912865 on a good night we move more alcohol than most bands do in a week
5912866 when we first started out our audiences were maybe a little reflection of us you know people in their later 20s early 30s and predominately dudes guys who buy records and watch sports and a smattering of angry girlfriends
5912867 i think as the bands audience has grown weve actually expanded younger and there are a lot more girls coming to the shows and a lot of girls making their presence more upfront and thats just amazing
5912868 one of the coolest things i see now is fathers and sons coming to the show together
5912869 were kind of a classic rock band and people who grew up in the 70s and 80s even can probably relate to us as much as a 21 year old kid now theres also a really interesting sense of community with the fans theres a particular group called the unified scene who wear matching t shirts and form these bonds through the shows and i never thought wed see that
5912870 its really exciting to think about where this band has been and where were going
5912871 when we started we wanted to play a show and drink some beer and then last summer we opened for the rolling stones and played glastonbury and we opened for the stooges in croatia this band has really taken us around the world and its allowed all of us to see so much im pretty much amazed on a daily basis
5912872 i was upset about the part of me being sold for 2 million
5912873 at times like this nobody is trying to sell me i could have come out and said oh yeah cam got bought out but i didnt go that route they just gotta watch me move we gonna make it hot
5912874 im just gonna say a lot of big records i was on a good portion of those records or asked to be on a good portion of those records that lil wayne was on along with him not like they asked me before they asked him or vice versa i know i was on a good portion of those records cause the i cant feel my face thing we were pushing that hard people wanted to get both of us i couldnt go as far as the clearances i could do my verse then it got to the point where i couldnt go there with people because i didnt want them to think that it was me being the bad guy not clearing stuff i didnt want that on my name so i would let people know i cant really if you wanna just put it out on the mixtapes we could do that all day the fans definitely missed out on a lot of juelz due to my contract
5912875 i tell people i couldnt do business with him but i will say he gave me the biggest chance i needed im a dude from the hood so the chance he gave me is a chance i needed to never turn back im good my artistry my talent my career was never built on controversy so i would never come out and say a whole bunch of things that could be said all i can say is im sorry he cant be here to be a part of whats about to happen because were about to tear em up
5912876 street kids united by loyalty and loot goons and n as getting it
5912877 i got a chance to learn a lot and be around cam and jim and watch us the diplomats one of the greatest movements and still one of the greatest movements doing this thing today i know the ins and outs of what it takes to build a powerful movement i know the things that got us to the points where we needed to be then i know some of the things that was holding us back i get to work around the things i need to work around jim has byrd gang i have the skull gang and freekey zekey has 730
5912878 its no hard feelings and now that im out of my situation i dont mind putting a diplomat album together
5912879 at first people kinda looked at us like damn whats going on
5912880 they looking at us like were disloyal but as the time went by its kinda like what we gonna do just die out because the dude that was supposed to be the boss and the head of the table decided to disappear that means we would have vanished along with that we from harlem baby we hustlers were gonna stay afloat were not even floating right now were surfing we not even surfing im the ocean
5912881 at this point no one is taking responsibility for which law is holding him there
5912882 now i understand that theres a florida law on fugitives that allows them to give no bond and the florida judge said he wont give bond unless the prosecutor here in arizona says its ok which is not happening
5912883 he will sit in jail until he adjudicates the charges there in miami and then well pick him up
5912884 it is considered too sexy for us its not good for viewers in malaysia
5912885 we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are good role models
5912886 in an increasingly competitive market in australia net prices have remained at last years level
5912887 without price improvement productivity initiatives were not sufficient to fully offset general inflationary cost pressures
5912888 the economic environment is uncertain and a changing competitive dynamic in the paint sector in australia will be further compounded by the introduction of imported paint by a major corporate retailer
5912889 given the changes that are occurring in the marketplace and the uncertain economic environment in which we are operating including no anticipated improvement in the housing sector it is too early to take a view on how the 2008 09 year will progress

5912895 the banks are a bit wishy washy but theyre not doing too bad
5912896 i come from the western suburbs of the gta over the last few election cycles it has voted liberal although the conservatives historically have done well and even as it has voted liberal a strong undercurrent of small c fiscal conservatism has remained and it is an area the tories will need to win seats in if they want a majority my question is that do you feel that with the green shift a risk exists of the tax break aspects of the plan which would appeal to these voters being overshadowed by the carbon tax idea and the environmental measures of the plan which small c conservative suburban voters are more wary of

5912902 workers are worried about what people will say if they take too long on their break
5912903 the biggest thing employers can do for productivity is encourage lunch workers tend to have a lot more energy if they take a break meaning theyre more on the ball for the afternoon stretch
5912904 you will find youre getting more work done than if you didnt break at all
5912905 workers tend to go home feeling energised and are less likely to lounge around and snack if theyve had a boost in the middle of the day
5912906 employees need to make more proactive choices when it comes to lunch and taking breaks in the office
5912907 employers need to lead by example and get out of the office at lunch
5912908 closing up shop and sending everyone out for lunch at the same time is exactly what we do in our office and it works immensely well

5912917 the development of animal free coating methods for hescs still remains a major challenge due to the complexity of ecms and insufficient knowledge about how hescs control cell cell and cell ecm interactions
5912918 until now it was generally assumed that the hesc colony formation was pivotal for maintaining pluripotency
5912919 but we show that pluripotency can be retained independent of close cell cell contact
5912920 his work is certainly an important step forward in both understanding signal transduction pathways in stem cells and in the development of an improved methodology for culturing stem cells
5912921 we found that the growth of the hescs under this novel culture condition was almost identical to the growth of hescs on matrigel coated culture plates with no compromise in pluripotency
5912922 our research goal is to understand the basic mechanisms underlying unique biological functions of pluripotent stem cells and to translate the obtained knowledge into future medical applications
5912923 our next step is to produce new animal free ips cell lines

5912989 people expect to be checked when they enter the country and for the government to determine if theyre admissible or not
5912990 what they dont expect is for the government to keep a record for 15 years of their comings into the country

5912995 i circulated fliers throughout the city and i wanted to see how many people came tonight
5912996 what im concerned about is getting back to regulation to increase competition and lower rates
5912997 im happy that theres about 150 to 200 people here i thought it would be more crowded because its a tri county issue
5912998 if i had eight hours to chop down a tree id spend six hours sharpening my ax
5912999 we also had a lot of players who enjoyed the game and its not like the game didnt sell at all but it should have been a lot better we really take responsibility for not being better but we can just sit around saying that really sucked or we can do something about it and so we were working really hard
5913000 part of it was because we overreached and that was a design problem that was totally our fault
5913001 we tried to do too much we tried to be a standalone game and a free play game and an mmo and an rpg and a shooter we were trying to be something for everybody and ended up really not pleasing many people at all
5913002 weve been working with comerica to try to identify people that might be interested in that even if this means that we cant work on it anymore which is pretty painful you spend four years working on a game and then to not even be able to do anything with pretty rough
5913003 we were looking for other companies that had that same mindset to work with and ultimately we found a couple that we were really interested to talk with and we actually entered into fairly lengthy negotiations with one particular company ultimately that didnt work out
5913004 the most successful online video game launch in korea of the past three years
5913005 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks it could be a boomerang storm
5913006 i dont know how that can be considered alarmist when were just really trying to tell people this is florida you got a system out there youve got to respect it youve got to get ready
5913007 in 1998 the lid was lifted on the corrupt world of nsw railways revealing that supplying prostitutes could win you a contract fake medical certificates signed by a dead doctor would get you a day off work and you could claim overtime while playing golf ten years later it seems little has changed in railcorp and the stench of corruption is slowly engulfing the nsw public sector in past 12 months the independent commission against corruption has held inquiries into three state government agencies the roads and traffic authority railcorp and the department of housing the nsw fire brigades has joined the list this week
5913008 it took me a while to let things go you just have to work through that stuff it takes a few years divorce is really awful a lot of people go through that more than once and i dont know how they do it i mean once was enough for me
5913009 were in this time when you have to be young and pretty weve gone back to that
5913010 there were a lot of people 10 or 15 years ago who were putting on funny clothes and playing some kind of country music who were dabbling
5913011 blue mountain was really authentic they were blending country blues and rock in an interesting way that only two or three bands were doing
5913012 it was one of the most happening places culturally in the country
5913013 fat possum records was based there so you had r l burnside and junior kimbrough and all those guys and oxford had this literary scene with larry brown and barry hannah there was a lot going on and we were kind of musically in the center of it
5913014 theres probably going to be periods of time where im probably not going to be making enough money from music and ill have to get an additional job
5913015 i mean thats how things have changed before we sold enough records and we made enough money on the road where we could really not worry about that for a while live show attendance has been up and down for everybody not just for us weve been lucky because we still have the markets where we did really well and were still doing really well but that could go away too
5913016 i have to say the one thing im glad to see is were also picking up some younger fans people who have heard of the band but never seen us or heard about us from their older brothers and sisters because if we were just playing to our old fans those people are like in the 30s and 40s now so theyve got kids you know theyre not packing the clubs anymore
5913017 i think its going to be fun and it really really feels good to be doing it again
5913018 frank and laurie are great friends one of the things that i thought about it was it was kind of unfinished business we kind of went out with a sigh more than a bang we want to come back and write another chapter
5913019 above all unity in the face of continuing russian refusal
5913020 i have an order to stop them here to not let anyone go past
5913021 they just call these foreign journalists move the column in front of them and then when they are gone they put them back so there has been no withdrawal whatsoever
5913022 i just remembered my great aunt always had this and she was in leningrad
5913023 even later when she had plenty of money and food she always had this now we have to think about these things again
5913024 you would think that some of these navajos would start selling some tacos
5913025 its not the kind of thing that we in our wildest dreams would expect to happen in our hospitals in our wildest nightmares i guess
5913026 anytime anybody puts any kind of regulation or handhold on why i cannot stand up here and speak my piece i dont feel its right i feel like we gave up part of what our forefathers fought for
5913027 there has been a little bit of talk about it
5913028 as long as its orderly and the commissions not actually voting on any comments that they make or feedback its just real time input and feedback as long as were not taking any action on it what would be the harm in it
5913029 dont come up here talkin to us about something that could be handled out of this commission meeting talk to us about commission business
5913030 in his view after the property boom australia had to take a squeeze
5913031 if communicating is talking thats what we have been doing at practice as we go forward i dont know i dont foresee anything changing if it does its in his court
5913032 its a tough situation especially when you come into a working environment
5913033 but my job is to stay professional im going to do what im supposed to do
5913034 at the beginning of camp i hadnt asked for a trade
5913035 if im not going to be treated fairly if my hard work and loyalty isnt going to be rewarded here then let me go somewhere where its going to be rewarded thats how i feel
5913036 honestly i think it should be completely separated i think thats why we have a department that deals with that
5913037 i feel the exact same way about anquan he is a good football player the cardinals have extended his contract once tried to do it again and our intent is to do it the first chance we get
5913038 i didnt mean we had to go right away i thought we could rest first
5913039 you do realize you are asking for rest in order to gain energy to lie around a pool
5913040 you have one two three four twelve bug bites all over your back
5913041 im a little surprised that people dont understand how easy i think it is for a young person especially myself to see this major situation as a positive i mean i dont see it as a positive but im not complaining about it
5913042 my thoughts and prayers to the challis family your son was a true inspiration blessing and gift god bless

5913057 registramos cerca de 130 animais em 18 meses um n mero alto considerando que os pontos de coleta de dados n o tinham nenhum tipo de isca ou atrativo artificial a id ia foi trabalhar com a freq ncia espont nea dos animais
5913058 esses animais s o mais adapt veis a essas mudan as ambientais do que imagin vamos mas isso n o necessariamente significa que estejam em boas condi es de vida pelo contr rio eles est o sujeitos a novos riscos gerados pelas reas alteradas principalmente pelas monoculturas
5913059 com isso elas t m uma probabilidade maior de morrer por causa da fragmenta o da floresta devido a vari veis como o contato com insumos agr colas identificamos tamb m lobos guar que morreram por enfisema pulmonar ap s terem aspirado fuma a das queimadas da cana de a car
5913060 mas quando o eucalipto cortado a cada cinco anos a paisagem fica isolada e os animais podem habitar apenas um fragmento espec fico de vegeta o correndo o risco de exaurir os recursos naturais do local

5913065 theres a big part of america that really believes that there is a war on terrorism and that we need to finish up
5913066 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq he came back and said some really nice things
5913067 so as far as leadership and patriotism goes i think its really important that those things have to take place and i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton and thats coming from a democrat
5913068 el asisti y manifest su descargo a trav s de una nota en la que se rectifica lo vertido porque el contexto en el cu l l lo planteaba
5913069 las situaciones particulares vividas en tres casos que aport en su fundamentaci n uno ocurrido en el 2006 otro en el 2007 y uno este a o
5913070 esto est dentro del expediente que conforma a partir de ahora una pieza administrativa el caso de este a o es una situaci n de alumnos que sufren adicciones a las drogas y que lamentablemente han producido hechos fuera del establecimiento escolar y la instituci n lo ha abordado porque son alumnos es el caso de un solo alumno
5913071 lo que l quer a significar en realidad era el hecho de que parte de la complejidad social son las adicciones y que tambi n est n dentro del establecimiento
5913072 tambi n manifiesta que esto que l anunciaba a los medios en su momento quer a significar una visi n de que hay alumnos adictos y que en la sociedad es un tema que se debe tocar y se debe trabajar
5913073 le preguntamos si l entend a la magnitud de sus declaraciones porque de la forma expresada implican tr fico el entiende que se expres mal y as lo dispone en sus descargos
5913074 la fiscal a federal de oficio ha intervenido cit ndolo para interiorizarse de la situaci n planteada en esto ha sido notificada la directora general de escuelas para que lo notifique acci n que se ha hecho y l se presentar en la fiscal a para dar su declaraci n ma ana a las 9
5913075 lo respetamos por su integridad y por su capacidad que lamentablemente al final de su carrera se vio envuelto en una situaci n como sta por una cuesti n estrictamente de t rminos nos hemos convencido de eso
5913076 porque por los aportes que hace son situaciones planteadas p blicamente en realidad lo que quer a es que en una mesa de dialogo como es la mesa pol tica en la que se estaban desarrollando las distintas problem ticas que hay en las instituciones una de ellas es la adicci n
5913077 esta tarea la estamos haciendo con la finalidad de vincular b sicamente capacitaci n y es un dise o de acciones para nuestros docentes y equipos directivos en cuanto a los profesionales que participan de la atenci n directa como son los profesionales del equipo de orientaci n y gabinetes psicopedag gicos est n desde el mes de marzo en una capacitaci n muy intensa en relaci n a las distintas din micas en las que deben intervenir tanto en la detecci n como a su vez en la prevenci n
5913078 le damos a los docentes las herramientas en cuanto al significado de s ntomas de signos y pr cticamente definir una evaluaci n del chico que pudiese tener riesgos en cuanto a trastornos de conducta producidos por ingesta en sus diversas formas
5913079 el punto de apoyo m s fuerte es la inserci n de esta direcci n con las dependencias que acontecen a las actividades de relaci n curricular como es primaria y media y adultos en el programa sedronar a trav s de un v nculo con el ministerio de salud a trav s de salud mental
5913080 vamos armando una red de construcci n social no trabaja la escuela sola trabajamos con las comunidades barriales y un fuerte v nculo con los municipios
5913081 vamos armando un concepto de prevenci n en cuanto a las necesidades puntuales que cada instituci n y directivo puedan se alar para a partir de all concretar este mecanismo
5913082 cuando se requiere de nuestra presencia entramos en una relaci n de v nculo con la dge y con programas de prevenci n de adicciones
5913083 en un primer paso se le pide a los docentes y los directivos que avisen al fono droga el segundo avisarnos en forma simultanea a nosotros y si existe necesidad de dar aviso a la secretar a tutelar se hace y a continuaci n si existe alguna estructura que sea de mayor complejidad obviamente se da aviso al 102
5913084 todas las estrategias deben ser utilizadas a favor de la protecci n del menor a partir de esa calificaci n es que son inmediatamente insertos en los tratamientos de rehabilitaci n a partir de los tres circuitos de rehabilitaci n

5913091 we havent given up the whale is still healthy we will try again to encourage it back out to deeper water
5913092 we are seeking help and advice of international experts including seaworld in san diego to see if there are any additional techniques or options we can try this is a unique difficult and sad situation
5913093 its not impossible and the fact it is snuggling up to a boat is a good sign it could be done
5913094 and the fact it has never been tried before in the world is a good reason to do it
5913095 the slapdash release of morrissey live at the hollywood bowl is done by warner without any consultation to me whatsoever and it is in breach of their terms as laid out by themselves in an agreement made for the film between warner and my ex manager
5913096 being warner predictably the sleeve art is appalling it is the work of cash hounds and i urge people not to buy it
5913097 i am not signed to warner and no royalties from this dvd will come to me please spend your money elsewhere thank you morrissey
5913098 the motivation behind the move was the need to scale our organization while taking into account employee preferences to be located together as much as possible spokeswoman malorie lucich said via e mail
5913099 the move is the best solution to limiting our continued fragmentation in palo alto
5913100 we have loved our time in downtown palo alto and consider it part of the dna here at facebook

5913252 i have begun a task to rebuild afghanistan into a peaceful prosperous country into a democratic country a country where the afghan people will have a voice and their rights respected a country that will be producing on its own and living off its own means
5913253 the afghan people still suffer massively in the war against terrorism and in the war for stability in afghanistan
5913254 the reason we are still around is because of the immense resilience of the afghan people and their goodheartedness toward the presence of the international community

5913256 teens view plastic surgery as a way to fit in and look acceptable to friends and peers
5913257 in working with adolescent females i see this as just another quick fix
5913258 the surgery has made me feel better now i have more self confidence when i go out im not afraid of my fake padding falling out i feel like i can look at myself and say im really pretty before something seemed like it was missing now theres nothing missing
5913259 but once you have your first surgery its like a huge open door you do see how easy it is to fix something
5913260 we also have to distinguish between procedures that are purely cosmetic and those that are reconstructive several factors are important in deciding when and for whom surgery is appropriate an ability to understand the procedure that the desire for surgery does not reflect what a parent friend or boyfriend desires and that expectations are realistic

5913265 some studies indicate that some women do experience sadness grief and feelings of loss following an abortion and some may experience clinically significant disorders including depression and anxiety
5913266 no evidence sufficient to support the claim that an observed association between abortion history and mental health was caused by the abortion per se as opposed to other factors
5913267 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
5913268 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
5913269 women have abortions for many different reasons and within different personal social economic and cultural circumstances all of which could affect a womans mental state following abortion consequently global statements about the psychological impact of abortion can be misleading
5913270 we dont know the first thing about safety and efficacy of these drugs even by themselves in these young ages let alone when they are mixed together
5913271 there are not any good scientific data to support the widespread use of these medicines in children particularly in young children where the scientific data are even more scarce
5913272 biederman shocked the child psychiatric world in 1996 by announcing that nearly a quarter of the children he was treating for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder also met his criteria for bipolar disorder up until then bipolar disorder was rarely diagnosed in teenagers and unheard of in prepubertal children biederman could justify his findings by simply broadening the semantic definitions of a previously more circumscribed condition contained within american psychiatrys bible the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders

5913276 my experiences fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe you can do whatever you want
5913277 there is a euphoria attached to the relentless feeding of the ego
5913278 the grandiosity in their own mind tends to make them so vain that an illusion of invincibility is created
5913279 narcissism creates an over amplification of who someone thinks they are and it creates self deception

5913317 ive been sailing back from port stephens and came in late last night and came in to a strange sucking sound on the bottom of the boat
5913318 it sounds like someone with a great vacuum cleaner trying to suck the bottom of the boat
5913319 but i realise now the whale must be sick or something its sort of limp

5913326 he former president chiluba was very saddened by the news that the country had lost president mwanawasa to the stroke although president mwanawasa has been unwell since june 29 we were hopeful and prayerful that he will fight the effects of this stroke and pull through so he was very saddened that president mwanawasa died and he has expressed his condolences to the acting president his excellency mr rupiah banda and he has wished his deepest sympathy to the first family to the government to the mmd and to the country at large
5913327 they had a very longstanding relationship that dates back to their days in ndola a town on the copper belt they worked together he chiluba was in the trade union and president mwanawasa was a lawyer and he was consulted several times in those early days at the dawn of democracy in 1990 they forged a friendship for the service of this country president chiluba was president and mr mwanawasa was his vice in the party and when president chiluba won elections in 1991 he invited mwanawasa to be his vice and mr mwanawasa was the vice president of the republic so they have a very strong longstanding relationship
5913328 even when president mwanawasa resigned as vice president and after so many years and even when president chilubas terms came to an end he still went to president mwanawasa and called upon him to be his successor he chiluba campaigned for him and president mwanawasa assumed office in 2002

5913351 i need glasses i need my filling replaced i have warrants i dont know what else i can do
5913352 its a compromise you have to understand the compromise before you make it
5913353 if you start dancing again you should know exactly what youre doing it for
5913354 dancing for survival is the worst thats when you really feel stuck
5913355 ive been thinking i should accept that im a gambler i gamble and if you gamble sometimes you dont have anything because you gambled it all away and thats ok if youre a gambler
5913356 the last thing i need is another sad piece of trash in my room to look at every day when i wake up oh well oh well
5913357 utterly baseless charge that is just a pretext to prevent him from posting more articles critical of the government
5913358 dieu cay posted articles criticizing chinas policy in the south china sea where both the chinese and vietnamese governments claim sovereignty over the spratly and paracel islands
5913359 the vietnamese authorities are copying their chinese neighbors both as regards internet filtering and harassment of internet users we call for dieu cays release
5913360 in my own reality i know that these things did happen
5913361 without him in them i can display them i can look at those pictures and think of the laughter we were sharing the places we went to
5913362 it used to be that photographs provided documentary evidence and there was something sacrosanct about that
5913363 is fulfilling the wish that all of us have to make reality to our liking
5913364 this faked photograph actually created the assumption people kind of remember him as there
5913365 thats the nature of the photograph its a western sense of reality that what is in front of the lens has to be true
5913366 its the only picture of my dad and me together
5913367 if the only reason i can get one is cropping it in it still means the same to me
5913368 a new script for dealing with problems families have always had family members who dont get along divorce
5913369 theyre supposed to last a lifetime generations really so why not get a helping hand to do it right
5913370 weve always taken photographs as proofs of events and we probably never should have
5913371 on the covers of magazines all the beautiful women are photoshopped their skin is cleaned up everybody does it
5913372 they have existed over time and space they are important documents
5913373 do not think that i came to bring peace on the earth i did not come to bring peace but a sword
5913374 and the rest were killed with the sword which came from the mouth of him who sat on the horse and all the birds were filled with their flesh
5913375 our entire group of sites are family and christian friendly
5913376 it is permissible for a muslim to kill an apostate a convert from islam
5913377 saudi arabia has to treat christians with the same respect that it wants muslims to be treated in other countries it has to stop exporting hate and persecution against christians in other countries
5913378 i want us to kind of put our roots down
5913379 we want to try and establish a true home court advantage and memorial coliseum is our true home
5913380 now any reasonable person would be hard pressed to say that our program is not the beneficiary of tremendous resources if they look at memorial coliseum
5913381 i never felt like we were in one place long enough to get into a rhythm
5913382 through experience i believe playing good competition is the best way to find out how to get prepared for the southeastern conference
5913383 and if no one is listening then it is because they dont want to hear because this is a referendum people dont need anyone to represent them they are representing themselves as somebody who has followed peoples movements and who has been in rallies and at the heart or the edge of things i dont think you can dispute what you see here
5913384 since the 1930s there have been debates and disputes about who has the right to represent the kashmiri people whether it was hari singh or sheikh abdullah or someone else and the debate continues till today whether it is the hurriyat or some other party
5913385 india needs azadi from kashmir as much as kashmir needs azadi from india
5913386 look son apologies to feminists here ill allow you to indulge in your delinquent behaviour in about two years from now when you are sixteen so why dont we make a deal and you have your freedom unquestioned and unfettered two years from now if you just exercise a little more self control now

5913400 jesus christ died for my sins and i am redeemed through him
5913401 is just a worldview and everybody has some kind of worldview its important to know what they are
5913402 it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods or no god it neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg

5913418 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5913419 whether im impeached or not the countrys stability will be compromised the office of the president will also be insulted pakistan is my love now and always my life is for pakistan i have defended and will continue to defend pakistan i want to be able to bring pakistan out of the current crisis so i think perhaps i should do something but i also do not want to do something that may generate uncertainty in the country i also want to save the parliament from horse trading even if the impeachment is defeated the relations between the presidents office and the coalition govt will not heal therefore with this situation in view and having consulted my legal and political advisors i have decided to resign from my post

5913421 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5913422 senator mccain was in a motorcade led by the united states secret service and held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5913423 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5913424 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5913425 that room was totally free with no monitors a flat out lie
5913426 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because that what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5913427 a motorist survey this year by the rubber manufacturers association found that 85 percent of american drivers do not properly check tire inflation pressure this is an alarming statistic since tires are the only part of a vehicle in contact with the road and a critical vehicle safety component
5913428 drivers across the u s can battle rising gas prices by simply maintaining proper tire inflation
5913429 current statistics indicate that 82 million vehicles have under inflated tires which means more rubber is hitting the road and accordingly miles per gallon is lessened in fact tire experts speculate that 2 8 billion gallons of gas is wasted by u s drivers each year simply because theyre driving on under inflated tires
5913430 the chps traffic safety commitment extends to safety campaigns like these which aim to reduce needless fatalities and injuries on california highways
5913431 our research shows that this improper inflation issue has been prevalent for years
5913432 that andreas excuse for leveling accusation against mac you buy into that prfsr
5913433 we as a campaign have not said anything about it though the mccain folks do seem pretty sensitive on the point
5913434 he made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops
5913435 obama had no intention of bringing any cameras with him i was there i can vouch for that

5913444 firm decisive leader time will tell if they are a majority

5913446 w e know one thing is for sure the current system is not working at all and we have too many young people not living up to their potential because of alcohol abuse
5913447 for some young people at 18 going to college its the first time theyve been away from home so they have to make major decisions you add drinking to the mix and thats going to mess them up a lot
5913448 everybody should be background checked there are too many kids up here not for no background checks

5913457 for a fraction of the cost of flaxseed oil you can buy actual flaxseeds and grind them yourself in a little spice or coffee grinder flax oil is never fresher than immediately after grinding purchased oil should be in a dark container and kept refrigerated as go rancid faster than other oils accelerated by light and temperature additionally you get the fibre from the seed which has its own set of benefits flaxseeds are 40 oil we add it to soups and oatmeal porridge it does have a slight taste but ignorable it adds fat feel to the taste low cooking of ground flaxseeds in a bit of water creates an eggwhite substitute though the heat may have an adverse effect on the are also known to help with mild depression and post partnum depression in a more traditional setting the straw of the flax would be used to make linen and a flax field in bloom is beautiful a sea of blue flowers

5913463 there were three blacks that were fired and another who was white the white employee wasnt fired
5913464 the mayor has done some things without the approval of the council before and its caused quite a bit of concern in the community
5913465 he has made some real rash decisions as of late
5913466 theres been several issues where weve voted as many as three times and murphys made the statement that he refuses to sign the check
5913467 weve been operating under very difficult situations for quite a while now
5913468 i feel like they were discriminated against i have to be honest here i have to be honest and i feel like they were
5913469 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation
5913470 compelling interest in ensuring full and equal access to medical treatment irrespective of sexual orientation and there are no less restrictive means for the state to achieve that goal
5913471 this was a reflection of a lack of transparent and free flowing exchange of opinion and data to facilitate in reaching a realistic decision
5913472 the committee further noted a pattern of defensive or no response at all to queries and comments made by the auditor general at the exit meetings

5913482 the 8 000 hectares of what is known as m2 is complicated by the presence of a lead mine and lead mining tenements and our view is that we should let that lead mine operation go ahead they provide their own infrastructure
5913483 the major factor holding back the growth of digital signage at this point is that its effectiveness isnt proven
5913484 but new studies by the nielsen co and others are trying to correlate product sales with the exposure people have to all these advertising screens
5913485 we control 150 different digital sign networks around the world and we know what content and what ads are being run on them at any time
5913486 our developers create an ad then log into the broadsign software and publish the ad to an individual screen
5913487 we have a group of ads that runs on the sign about every 2 1 2 minutes the advertisers are local businesses such as dentists fast food restaurants and real estate agents
5913488 digital signs are an emerging market and the reason is the underlying problem with print advertising in places like banking retail and quick serve restaurants
5913489 you print the material send it to a location and hope the manager puts it up and takes it down when he or she is supposed to digital signage does all that for you
5913490 in many cases we dont know if anyone saw the advertising

5913500 theyre our two most experienced receivers and ralph has had a great camp so thats where we start
5913501 and hes much better than he was a year ago
5913502 they were the primary receivers now you take ernie off the team and there are 60 or so catches that somebody else has to have divide those among the returning players and the freshmen coming in and somebody has to get those catches

5913512 the us and india are certainly using strong arms tactics but reports that a decision on the proposal could occur this week dont appear to match with the reality that many states of the 45 member nsg group still have significant concerns
5913513 the us germany and india are privately acknowledging that a second or third meeting will likely be convened sometime in september on the issue and that changes to the us august 6 proposed text will be necessary to achieve nsg consensus
5913514 perhaps in recognition of many difficulties the proposal faces in the nsg germany has reportedly invited india to present its case and answer questions from nsg countries at this weeks meeting
5913515 the reports cite unnamed india officials as saying they are hesitant to do so that is not surprising since indias participation in the discussion could force its officials to answer some uncomfortable but essential questions about its bilateral nuclear cooperation agreements with the us france and russia as well as its interpretation of the india iaea safeguards agreement and other issues

5913522 it has such rich history and tradition yet it also provides todays sports fan with entertainment i like that blend of respecting the past and looking towards the future it mirrors our design philosophy as well
5913523 the beauty of vintage designs is that theyre timeless no matter how fast we progress in other fields fashion always comes back to classic looks
5913524 particularly in sports fans want to associate with clothing that gives them that sense of nostalgia our clothing gives them a chance to wear comfortable high quality garments that combine the history of their team with todays fashion styles

5913535 when john michael and jessica were small i used an analogy id heard to try to explain this dilemma that even little children feel
5913536 you see ive come to realize that satan is not nearly as disappointed at losing me from his kingdom as he is determined to keep me from being effective in gods kingdom our enemy wants to keep us so consumed with our own inadequacies that we never get around to appropriating the love and transforming power god has made available to us through his son
5913537 i have to get so sick and tired of the spiritual tug of wars and playground games that i finally pray lord i want to be on your side
5913538 oh we already hired someone but we wanted to hear what you had to say because we thought he sounded knowledgeable
5913539 we looked across the government expenditure in the recent budget and we tightened that was one of the ways we delivered the budget surplus and we thought that was very important in fighting inflation
5913540 the government has got no present plans to make changes
5913541 no one can dictate to poland what it should do thats in the past
5913542 our neighbours should now understand that our nation will never give in nor allow itself to be intimidated
5913543 no one should be afraid of the shield if they have good intentions towards us or the rest of the west

5913547 in its struggle against terrorism france has just been hard hit
5913548 my determination is intact france is committed to pursuing the struggle against terrorism for democracy and for freedom
5913549 this is a just cause it is an honour for france and for its army to defend it
5913550 serious measures notably in the air were taken to support and extricate our men caught in an extremely violent ambush
5913551 i think the boundaries as i said when they were first released in draft form in a number of areas make the next election tougher for labor
5913552 there are a number of features of them for example the very significant size of the mount isa electorate new seats created in
5913553 it wont be an easy election in 2009 i acknowledge that but the finalisation of these boundaries gives certainty
5913554 candidates can now get out there and know who their electors will be
5913555 she has my support to stand in a seat that frankly is very similar to the one she currently holds
5913556 the end result of a careful process of adjustment is that there has been an increase in the number of electorates in the faster growing regions of the southeast necessitating a reduction in other less populous areas
5913557 all told there have been many changes to existing boundaries in all regions to enable electoral districts to meld with their neighbouring electorates
5913558 this is the balance between one vote one value and the reality of servicing a very large state
5913559 i feel very very fit but i still have a long way to go
5913560 i think that will come with match practice and in the next three weeks i am looking forward to getting back to a certain level that is comparable to where i was in the past
5913561 im just looking forward to taking this step by step and doing these games and then we can see afterwards where things lie
5913562 i appreciate that some of these issues in playgrounds for instance within 10 metres of childrens play equipment are going to be difficult
5913563 but im a great believer in the educative effect of legislation
5913564 we were told that when we banned smoking in pubs and clubs two years ago that people wouldnt comply that there would be civil disobedience
5913565 that hasnt happened and i think the public will be the greatest enforcer of these bans i think you will find the public will warm to these bans in the interests of public health
5913566 i would be very hesitant to simply say we would go down this very extreme position that mr mcgintys taken
5913567 id say in confined spaces you shouldnt smoke but out in the open air as long as youre not impacting directly on other people i dont know that we need to be so restrictive and encourage such a nanny state as jim mcginty would have it
5913568 lets have a bit of faith in people to do the right thing and not try and demonise people because they might smoke
5913569 we know its bad for their health and they know its bad for their health and lets not demonise them
5913570 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5913571 the foot bones connected to the ankle bone the ankle bones connected to the shin bone
5913572 it is getting a little bit old this happening all the time and like i said they can raise it up if they want to but im not going to sit here and let the state and federal people beat up on our taxpayers
5913573 theres inherent conflict because you have the people making the determination on the claims are also guarding the fund
5913574 ojibwa has a long history of families some families who attended school here their children come to school here grandchildren come to school here

5913775 increasing sales and decreasing median prices are reflective of home buyers recognizing the increased affordability of our existing home market and are steadily coming off the sidelines
5913776 although it is still too early to say for sure this is beginning to look like the early stages of a market rebound we still have a surplus of homes in the market but with increasing sales the inventory of homes is shrinking and if this continues will result in a housing market upswing

5913778 uncontrolled wildland fires pose a serious threat to lives property and natural resources throughout the region
5913779 what is really frustrating is to have a second devastating fire occur in the same area under basically the same conditions despite the amount of information that has been made available over the years through public education programs that promote defensible space
5913780 if we take the bushes out of our backyard and we have a flash flood or rain its going to wash this hill out

5913783 reduce the amount of vegetation through which a fire can travel
5913784 if you eliminate dead and dying vegetation on many properties you can often see youve eliminated 50 percent of whats on ground

5913786 we want to get with the marching band and let them know they are loved in this community
5913787 we need the people out there to help us with 5 or a nickel whatever they can send send it so eventually we can endow it and help the marching band so it goes on
5913788 we all know that pack games wouldnt be the same without the band and this fundraising drive can help protect a valuable university asset
5913789 this band is the band of the region and it should lead any major thing we do in the region where we have to have music or bands
5913790 if we have president candidates come to town and they have a band it should be the university of nevada band
5913791 its not just the universitys marching band its northern nevadas marching band and we are very grateful for the mayor stepping up at a time when we are making huge cuts throughout the university
5913792 and we are really appreciative because we know it takes a whole community to build the kind of university this community wants so we are grateful when people like the mayor step up

5913795 i heard that the us state secretary ms condoleezza rice said russia wants to undermine democracy in georgia as if there were no facts this year showing there is no true democracy in georgia as if the georgian leadership did not decide soon after it started its aggression against south ossetia to shut down all russian television channels in georgia and to cut off access to russian internet sites
5913796 but even this channel was shut down after it dared to air my interview with radio ekho moskvy and vesti 24
5913797 so judge for yourself about the situation with democracy in georgia and who undermines this democracy

5913800 even just seeing a 42 increase in traffic to our website is an indicator people are already seeking help
5913801 with repossessions set to rise this year we worry that even though we provide advice online on the phone and in person that we havent got the resources to help everyone
5913802 in fact many people looked at me as if i was crazy when i told them they think being homeless means being on the streets

5913804 there is no evidence of a need for a new advice service
5913805 free independent advice on both housing and money issues is widely available from existing agencies such as citizens advice bureaux
5913806 act on evidence act on reasonable suspicion but where there is none close the investigation down and let this development application run its course
5913807 thats whats best for scotland lets do whats best for scotland and for heavens sake stop being our own worst enemy
5913808 all parties on the committee are acting on behalf of the parliament to scrutinise the actions of government to examine the process not the merits of the planning application
5913809 many it shops simply ignored the 90 day license transfer restriction and had never taken the step to purchase additional licenses for the sole sake of virtualizing a microsoft application
5913810 small and medium businesses smbs that have individual exchange or sql server licenses purchased through a var microsoft categorizes such licenses as full packaged product fpp or oem system builder are not covered under the new policy
5913811 clarification from software vendors on licensing for virtual environments has been sparse creating confusion among users
5913812 microsoft is now addressing this and though it is currently limited to a selection of applications its a good step forward by setting out a clear position on virtual license mobility microsoft is simplifying the transition and removing one of the major road blocks to virtualization adoption as the biggest software company in the world recognizes that virtualization is fundamentally changing the business of it and not a passing fad hopefully we will start to see other software vendors following suit and likewise developing a clear and fair license model for virtual environments
5913813 youll have to reproduce the problem in a physical environment first before we can provide you with support
5913814 when i was young the situation was very bad my movements my control were not very good so i was always changing coaches
5913815 coaches dont want to spend long time shaping someone who is no good they want to train a pretty good sportsman so i was quite confused i even thought there was no point in carrying on training
5913816 the gold medal has a different meaning i have always made little mistakes and been nervous in big events but this time i controlled myself better

5913828 csas board of directors initiated this award program five years ago
5913829 this is a great opportunity for owners and operators to recognize the accomplishments of their mariners and shore side staff while the public hear of instances when there are environmental problems they should know that this industry has an excellent record of environmental accomplishment we have seen a growing awareness of this program among the industry since we began last year 755 vessels owned or operated by forty five companies received awards totaling 4 354 years of environmental excellent operation this is a tremendous accomplishment by the industry and one that is not well known we initiated these awards to let our seagoing and shore side personnel know that we appreciate all they do as good stewards of our marine environment the board encourages all vessel owners and operators to nominate their compliant vessels for this award

5913835 however the concurrent decline in cognitive performance which is associated with the dopamine increases suggests that the adaptation is not sufficient to overcome the cognitive deterioration induced by sleep deprivation and may even contribute to it
5913836 the development of animal free coating methods for hescs still remains a major challenge due to the complexity of ecms and insufficient knowledge about how hescs control cell cell and cell ecm interactions
5913837 until now it was generally assumed that the hesc colony formation was pivotal for maintaining pluripotency
5913838 but we show that pluripotency can be retained independent of close cell cell contact
5913839 his work is certainly an important step forward in both understanding signal transduction pathways in stem cells and in the development of an improved methodology for culturing stem cells
5913840 we found that the growth of the hescs under this novel culture condition was almost identical to the growth of hescs on matrigel coated culture plates with no compromise in pluripotency
5913841 our research goal is to understand the basic mechanisms underlying unique biological functions of pluripotent stem cells and to translate the obtained knowledge into future medical applications
5913842 our next step is to produce new animal free ips cell lines
5913843 the mechanism of action through which this surgery is successful at improving gerd may be independent of weight loss and needs further examination
5913844 the magnitude of the obesity epidemic adds a staggering burden to our current health care system these studies point to the serious potential risks of gi disease for individuals who are overweight or obese
5913845 college student experience of mental health service use and psychiatric medication
5913846 university mental health providers have observed increased numbers of students visiting college mental health centers
5913847 were at a time when students are being diagnosed at a younger age with mental illnesses
5913848 it s hard not to be impressed with apple this is product extension at its best where the new products ipod and iphone are helping bring new customers to existing computer products the fact that apple is not dependent on the windows vista operating system hasn t hurt either
5913849 i believe this notion of understanding user intent being able to analyze search queries and come up with search patterns and use them to shape the search experience is one of the most important areas for us
5913850 if we come again and again with innovation that matters we will have the opportunity to grow our volume and our share
5913851 we made decent progress but we have a ways to go
5913852 we think that tech natural language processing is going to be a very critical way for us to improve relevance further at scale
5913853 these are the domains where we have domain specific task oriented
5913854 cpc is fantastic it will remain but there will be additional things such as cpa
5913855 we think that will bring next level of efficiency to the search marketplace were very bullish about that
5913856 have overcome a major barrier to large scale solar power storing energy for use when the sun doesnt shine
5913857 solar power has always been a limited far off solution
5913858 now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
5913859 but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
5913860 never mind the reports by the energy department that no significant amounts of oil from new offshore leases could be brought to market before 2030 and even then would have a minimal effect on world oil supplies and prices
5913861 i determine that mr zentai is eligible for surrender to the republic of hungary and therefore he is remanded in custody

5913863 they are trying to ensure teams present themselves in the best possible light i understand where the rule comes from but to suspend players is wrong
5913864 in its struggle against terrorism france has just been hard hit
5913865 my determination is intact france is committed to pursuing the struggle against terrorism for democracy and for freedom
5913866 this is a just cause it is an honour for france and for its army to defend it
5913867 serious measures notably in the air were taken to support and extricate our men caught in an extremely violent ambush
5913868 we are aware of the competition and believe there is enough room for all of us
5913869 but as i tell our future residents 80 is the new 60
5913870 some of the go go seniors are having trouble because they have trapped equity in their homes
5913871 all of the people in the coach are workers on our farm
5913872 they had a day off to go to alton towers they do this kind of thing quite often
5913873 we just couldnt believe it my daughter rushed straight up there to help
5913874 most of the workers are back here now everyone is in shock
5913875 while i have been at alton towers we have had an open dialogue about where we are with an eastern access road and i made a commitment at the beginning of the year that we would return to them in january with a definitive answer
5913876 the bus was coming down a steep hill towards the bridge at the bottom and from what i can see at the scene that bus has not managed to go round the bend and has careered through a wall and down a drop into a garden
5913877 we cant get that information from the driver as he is critically injured
5913878 the court has ordered that i get to talk to the boys for 10 min every other week and i want my extra 4 min
5913879 i had no idea of what the blog would become and if i knew the blog would be part of my professional identity i might have chose a different name than chimprawk but im glad i didnt and i think my blogs name was a reminder not to take any of this too seriously this is all an experiment
5913880 but looking around they realized that something seemed out of the ordinary the rainbow flag was the first clue but tomas simply shrugged and invited those who were there no matter their orientation to celebrate with a drink out of the stanley cup
5913881 when it comes down to it brendan has to make a decision thats right for him and his family it could be new york but we hope he explores the blues as a viable option
5913882 these detectives work very hard to shut down these illegal operations and jail those responsible for breaking the law
5913883 maybe one of these days well move back here but its going to take a long time before i can get it out of the back of my mind
5913884 we still have this lovely burn mark to remind us there are a lot of memories here and they are not good
5913885 we felt it was imperative for us to take a stance
5913886 it would speak volumes to their desire to advance the laws to be protective of all individuals which it doesnt right now to the fullest extent of the law
5913887 if i have to go to the state senate and sit up there and tell my story 100 times its going to be added
5913888 the 308 touring will appeal to families that find a hatch too small but dont want a 4wd
5913889 booming sales of suvs in australia show there is clearly demand for practicality and extra seating before people have been looking at suvs to satisfy this need but the 308 touring gives them another option something different
5913890 it doesnt seem to make sense that you would include in the tax hybrid vehicles and green vehicles that are ultra fuel efficient
5913891 i dont know a lot about the cars but i have heard it is very exciting and fast racing and that the tracks are also exciting it should be a lot of fun
5913892 it was a big surprise for me the car was completely different to drive than i had expected
5913893 it was also much more powerful and i had to adapt my driving from a front wheel to rear wheel drive but i am very excited
5913894 we would love to get our hands on the ute as quickly as possible
5913895 that is such a big part of the market that we cannot enter
5913896 if we can get the robust into our model range we could easily double our commercial vehicle sales
5913897 we are involved in what the robust could do what engines it could have because we are a significant market for utes
5913898 vehicle safety technologies are regularly identified in state and federal road safety strategies as a countermeasure to the number of crashes and injuries
5913899 the victorian and federal governments have not taken sufficient steps to ensure that vehicle safety in australia keeps pace with international developments
5913900 the committee has seen convincing evidence that vehicles imported and even those manufactured in australia often have safety technologies removed from models sold in australia
5913901 give him a free pass their default clich is to present him as the old faithful everyone already knows
5913902 for any other politician who didnt have the benefit of years of friendship or acquaintance with many of the reporters covering him be a major topic of debate in the campaign
5913903 in addition to our volunteer efforts we register voters attend republican party gatherings and seminars and build friendships through
5913904 they decided to play everybody who showed up for fairness sake
5913905 we must caution that our operating environment remains uncertain he said
5913906 the slowdown in the growth rate of the index can be mainly attributed to the sharp fall in the share market tighter liquidity as represented by money supply weak dwelling approvals and softer data for us industrial production
5913907 with rates well into the contractionary zone and global liquidity conditions deteriorating there is a strong case for a larger first cut of 0 5 per cent
5913908 that seems a more effective strategy than current market expectations of two consecutive 0 25 per cent moves
5913909 mortgage choice is confident that it is well placed to achieve another successful year in fiscal 2009
5913910 most lenders mortgage interest rates were increased independently of the reserve bank by approximately 60 basis points and mortgage lending policies were tightened all of which had a profound effect on the australian mortgage market
5913911 for us queensland and victoria outperformed the larger new south wales market in this reporting period
5913912 the fact that we now have less reliance on new south wales is also a major plus in terms of earnings resilience given the continued subdued nature of the new south wales economy
5913913 western australian house price growth has plateaued while the south australian market showed strong growth after lagging behind other states for some time
5913914 we are excited by the relationship with imdea energy because this initial project to use our ultracapacitor technology could easily be the first of many projects with them and the spanish government
5913915 there are many great uses for our ultracapacitor and microbattery technologies from consumer electronics to military applications having imdea use the ultracapacitors for a clean energy commercial initiative opens up several new opportunities for enable ipc both in the u s and internationally
5913916 baggies sub deal a freshly made sub of your choice and a bag of walkers crisps for 1 95

5913919 instead of resurrecting a non issue like fred baron why doesnt john cornyn explain to the people of texas why he voted six times against bipartisan legislation to expand the childrens health insurance program every time a child goes to the emergency room because a parent couldnt afford quality healthcare that parent can thank john cornyn
5913920 she couldnt come up with eight time gold medal winner michael phelps name and then she yammered on about how she was the one training for a triathlon just six months after giving birth and how that was the big story right now not the swimmer
5913921 what do you expect from me i want 12 kids
5913922 i wish i had been nude from the time i was 12 until i was 28 i looked great
5913923 i so wish i had listened to my mom and grandma when i was 18 and would complain about some little tiny bump or feeling bloated
5913924 i used to scoff and say no i feel fat today now the jokes on me
5913925 i have to get back to work this is it
5913926 they are separated for the moment but are working on it
5913927 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything
5913928 i just wanted to kind of get rid of this whole thing for me
5913929 this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
5913930 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
5913931 im going to have cute boobs til im 90 so theres that
5913932 ill have the best boobs in the nursing home ill be the envy of all the ladies around the bridge table
5913933 and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really upset you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes and i think that its all part of the healing
5913934 i feel very very fit but i still have a long way to go
5913935 i think that will come with match practice and in the next three weeks i am looking forward to getting back to a certain level that is comparable to where i was in the past
5913936 im just looking forward to taking this step by step and doing these games and then we can see afterwards where things lie
5913937 we looked across the government expenditure in the recent budget and we tightened that was one of the ways we delivered the budget surplus and we thought that was very important in fighting inflation
5913938 the government has got no present plans to make changes
5913939 i appreciate that some of these issues in playgrounds for instance within 10 metres of childrens play equipment are going to be difficult
5913940 but im a great believer in the educative effect of legislation
5913941 we were told that when we banned smoking in pubs and clubs two years ago that people wouldnt comply that there would be civil disobedience
5913942 that hasnt happened and i think the public will be the greatest enforcer of these bans i think you will find the public will warm to these bans in the interests of public health
5913943 i would be very hesitant to simply say we would go down this very extreme position that mr mcgintys taken
5913944 id say in confined spaces you shouldnt smoke but out in the open air as long as youre not impacting directly on other people i dont know that we need to be so restrictive and encourage such a nanny state as jim mcginty would have it
5913945 lets have a bit of faith in people to do the right thing and not try and demonise people because they might smoke
5913946 we know its bad for their health and they know its bad for their health and lets not demonise them
5913947 no one can dictate to poland what it should do thats in the past
5913948 our neighbours should now understand that our nation will never give in nor allow itself to be intimidated
5913949 no one should be afraid of the shield if they have good intentions towards us or the rest of the west
5913950 we want russia to be able to have the possibility if it so desires to inspect the future base
5913951 el reto de aprenderse un nuevo circuito siempre es emocionante particularmente cuando es un lugar inusual como el nuevo street circuit en valencia
5913952 debemos prepararnos lo m s que podamos por adelantado nuestra caminata con los ingenieros el jueves y las sesiones de pr ctica del viernes ser n la clave para aprendernos la pista y conocer los niveles de agarre
5913953 una nueva pista siempre abre las oportunidades donde los pilotos tendr n mucha responsabilidad ya que seg n lo que sientan en la pista as va a ser la configuraci n que se va a usar
5913954 nos hemos preparado bien y estoy esperando el fin de semana
5913955 if you try to hang on to your life you will lose it but if you give it up your life for my sake
5913956 there are the bloodstains on the wall and here it is dried on the floor
5913957 and here a womans shoes she was a victim of the militia we found her corpse in the grave
5913958 here is a chain we found tied to an old mans body
5913959 spies you will dig your own graves long live the mehdi army
5913960 we found this chain on an old mans corpse that we dug out of the grave
5913961 i am sorry to ask this question we are just trying to learn about health problems in hubli please forgive me but has this family lost any children due to illness
5913962 yes he was 5 years old very ill long time i dont know what it was
5913963 instead of needing relaxation measurements that require using neutron scattering a national facility with limited time availability we have developed a widely accessible solution in the form of readily available steady state fluorescence measurements
5913964 this will allow pharmaceutical companies to adopt the new metrology weve developed
5913965 in these experiments we are asking a very fundamental question how can we better understand the detailed properties of neutrinos
5913966 in order to understand neutrino mixing and oscillations we must know the value of the unknown mixing angle
5913967 all we know so far is that it is small
5913968 this would show that the neutrino is its own antiparticle
5913969 currently some evidence suggests that neutrinos are different from antineutrinos while certain theories predict that they are actually the same particle it is important to understand whether those theories are true or not
5913970 there should have been equal amounts of matter and anti matter present at the big bang the beginning of the universe
5913971 today however matter dominates our earth explaining why we dont annihilate each other when we shake hands if the neutrino turns out to be its own antiparticle this might help us to understand more about this imbalance
5913972 this experiment asks key questions about how our corner of the universe exists today as it does with matter but no anti matter
5913973 our work was motivated by the increasing occurrences of occupational and consumer nanoparticle skin exposures and the fact that in vitro studies suggest that nanoparticles including quantum dots can exhibit dose and time dependent cytotoxic effects
5913974 in conducting this work we also hope to shed light on inconsistencies that exist in pre existing literature with regard to nanoparticle skin penetration using ex vivo skin models
5913975 in vivo skin penetration of quantum dot nanoparticles in the murine model the effect of uvr
5913976 understanding the mechanisms and extent to which nanomaterials can penetrate skin is essential for establishing exposure health and safety guidelines
5913977 our work advances this field as it documents that the outside in barrier defect following an acute uv exposure permits quantum dot penetration we found that the accelerated epidermal proliferation and differentiation of uv radiated skin repair response is insufficient to prevent thequantum dots from breeching the skin barrier
5913978 this knowledge will be used to rationally design nanoparticles to prevent or increase their penetration levels
5913979 the ability to control nanoparticle penetration profiles will enable design of safe consumer products and will enable new biomedical technologies such as target nanoparticle therapeutic and diagnostic biomedical applications
5913980 the university of michigan peptides have unique characteristics that we believe play an important role in improving the efficacy of delivery of rnai based therapeutics
5913981 these cationic peptides have the potential of being critical components of rnai based therapeutic formulations we are currently using these peptides to create sirna nanoparticles to enhance gene expression knockdown together with the dila 2 platform of novel delivery lipids these delivery peptides improve the therapeutic potential of our drug candidates
5913982 the european market continues to track ahead of expectations with strong same store sales growth of 13 36 per cent while australia and new zealand increased by 4 1 per cent above full year 2007
5913983 it is a joy to remember my daughter in a way that supports my enduring goal of creating a level playing field for the education of all students regardless of their background
5913984 in making this donation i also think of my father who became director of the mackay school of mines in reno nv and was entrusted with large grants as the metallurgy field expanded in the 1920s just as nanotechnology is revolutionizing the worlds of science and engineering today education is the key to developing the full potential of nanotechnology and i am pleased to support a graduate student in this exciting and important field
5913985 we are grateful to dr belz for her generous donation to establish a new endowment at ualbanys college of nanoscale science and engineering
5913986 by honoring the memory of her daughter in this way dr belz is demonstrating her belief in the importance of providing exceptional higher education while also creating a lasting legacy of support for students exploring scientific fields that have the power to positively impact our society
5913987 i am truly honored and humbled that dr belz has chosen to pay tribute to her daughter by establishing a graduate fellowship at the ualbany nanocollege
5913988 this gift will provide critical support for the pioneering educational curriculum and unmatched research programs available at cnse while also ensuring that the best and brightest students have access to cutting edge scientific know how that is vital to their careers and to further growth at cnse the university and throughout new york state
5913989 we are most appreciative to dr belz for this generous donation which truly reflects both her lifelong love of education and her commitment to providing exciting opportunities for all students
5913990 this gift represents an investment in the world class educational and research programs at ualbanys college of nanoscale science and engineering and assists in ensuring that our students will be exceptionally well prepared for the scientific careers of the 21st century

5914002 everybody was expecting them to win including them and when they called out our names instead it was perfect when we watched the video takes later on we saw them and their producer rolling their eyes and glaring when we won
5914003 people were complaining about us everywhere in the papers and on the radio
5914004 it was very annoying actually because most of the people hadnt even seen our show but they had seen kath amp kim
5914005 we dont like them because were actually from the west and theyre these fancy rich old comedians making fun of lower class people
5914006 weve always been opposed to that sort of comedy and it really got us thinking about the type of show we wanted to make and thats what weve done in the second series its all about lower class people having cool fantasies and action adventures not just being bogans that people laugh at
5914007 she wanted to punish us for beating her favourite kath amp kim
5914008 thats why it took us so long to come back with a second series she never said as much to our face but it wasnt until she left and the new dude came that we were allowed to make another series
5914009 its been suggested and we are now talking about that in some way i dont know what it will be but we are having a bit of a think about it
5914010 i admire their tone a lot its so beautifully downbeat
5914011 a lot of flying back and forth to sydney for meetings
5914012 one australian farmer thought all his sons had been killed on one day at gallipoli and found one was alive it is a big big story
5914013 in an age where all success is monitored by your ability to be seen and noticed their whole raison detre is to fly under the radar
5914014 i was being offered lots of stuff but i thought why i have just done what i wanted to do
5914015 we went and lived in turkey and spain went broke
5914016 i said will you go out with me if i see the other person she said yes and that was the last time she ever touched me
5914017 banu will come home 20 minutes late and ill say hmm 20 minutes late and no thought of a phone call
5914018 we would work all weekend editing fast forward and then full frontal and when you have so many shows going even when you have a success like seachange there is always something that is stiffing but i loved the energy of that place and wonderful people went through there
5914019 i used to work in a building with marble lifts artist services st kilda rd headquarters
5914020 i went from being a hippie or from having a lot of hair to having a lot of money then i lost a lot of that i got divorced
5914021 it would be self serving of me to be super critical

5914024 people can make a doco on food hygiene in 1976 and still be around there is no sorting out it is not how you do excellence
5914025 they said we want the fat gay guy to do the sistine chapel
5914026 if i were running the abc it would have a 10 oclock timeslot devoted to new talent
5914027 then this matron uttered the immortal line i know your mother has just died but we do have rules about the tea kitchen we just all burst out laughing we thought that was the funniest thing in the history of the world
5914028 comedy is what you do when you dont have biceps to pick up women and really i am too old

5914031 welcome to chilo a planet with corrosive rain crushing pressure and deadly heat fortunately fourteen year old timas lives in one of the domed cities that float 100 000 feet above the surface circling near the edge of a monstrous perpetual storm above the acidic clouds the temperature and pressure are normal but to make a living timas like many other young men is lowered to the surface in an armored suit to scavenge what he can timass life is turned upside down when a strange man crash lands on the city the newcomer is fleeing an alien intelligence intent on invading the planet and discovering the secret hidden deep inside the perpetual storm a secret that could lead to interplanetary war
5914032 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us
5914033 with the state offering tax credits for movie companies this was perfect timing for him
5914034 they had 2 200 interviews and only 175 made it
5914035 caleb was the youngest most of the others were between 13 and 18 years old
5914036 its kind of unreal so far everything is happening so fast
5914037 whats it like in bay county well 3 miles below us its 119 degrees centigrade above the boiling point of water so all we need to do is get the heat up here
5914038 it may save us from the worst of global warming
5914039 you have been called upon in the past and will be in the future to make decisions
5914040 when you made your decision about the coal plant there were a lot of things you couldnt have known
5914041 right now there is zero money for geothermal research since bush cut it out about three years ago
5914042 we are a debtor nation due to oil so something needs to be done
5914043 i think its going to probably take some time but hopefully renewable energies will be an important factor down the road
5914044 the hottest and coolest thing in the world of renewable energy
5914045 they estimate the cost of 10 megawatts of electricity at 32 million
5914046 if we could use those to replace that coal plant it would be a wash on the cost but once those geothermal devices are in place you dont pay for coal anymore thats the kind of power of the future that innovation can unleash
5914047 we are a manufacturing state we ought to be manufacturing this stuff
5914048 ill bet the producer called me 28 times trying to buy my dune buggy for his film
5914049 it belongs to my daughter here sarah and shed have a fit if i let it go
5914050 weve been out here since the pig was sitting in three parts out back
5914051 we live about two hours away and he had to be here at 6 30 this morning for make up
5914052 were not charging to park but well take donations to help fix the lawn after this is over
5914053 ironically were thinking about borrowing money from our rainy day fund and its raining inside city hall
5914054 everybody is concerned about the roof and the right thing to do is to fix it
5914055 sometimes when it does rain the leaks come farther down into the third floor and i know that we have had some come down into the second floor
5914056 during this last rainfall that we had in july we had numerous areas and i dont think we had enough buckets to put out for how many leaks we had going at once
5914057 that they have a damp feeling up on the fourth floor or even like a moldy smell
5914058 she robinson enjoyed police work as far as i know
5914059 do you know who you are f ing with we are the police
5914060 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
5914061 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything
5914062 i just wanted to kind of get rid of this whole thing for me
5914063 this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
5914064 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really upset you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes and i think that its all part of the healing
5914065 i was just shaking and and then also immediately i had to go into
5914066 you know i really love living and i really love my life i knew from this moment on it was only going to be good and that was going to be coming
5914067 yeah im going to face challenges but you cant get any darker than where ive been so just knowing that in my soul gave me the strength to just say ive got to i have to get out there and and make this positive
5914068 i get phone calls very regularly from concerned relatives saying look i think my mother or my father is a victim of a scam they wont listen to us
5914069 here they have this dream that their life is going to turn around all their money problems are finished and theyll be able to have a future
5914070 many elderly people cannot financially recover once they have been defrauded

5914077 i think the boundaries as i said when they were first released in draft form in a number of areas make the next election tougher for labor
5914078 there are a number of features of them for example the very significant size of the mount isa electorate new seats created in
5914079 it wont be an easy election in 2009 i acknowledge that but the finalisation of these boundaries gives certainty
5914080 candidates can now get out there and know who their electors will be
5914081 she has my support to stand in a seat that frankly is very similar to the one she currently holds
5914082 the end result of a careful process of adjustment is that there has been an increase in the number of electorates in the faster growing regions of the southeast necessitating a reduction in other less populous areas
5914083 all told there have been many changes to existing boundaries in all regions to enable electoral districts to meld with their neighbouring electorates
5914084 this is the balance between one vote one value and the reality of servicing a very large state
5914085 dont worry well be home soon be a good boy
5914086 doctors dont always agree on a prognosis there is a fair amount of objectivity and there is a certain amount of subjectivity
5914087 as a result of this recommendation it appears that dr rainville would not sign paperwork to support a total and permanent disability claim
5914088 it appears at this point that dc district chief famolare begins to doctor shop
5914089 following that appointment dr mahoney then signs off on dc famolares paperwork declaring him totally disabled
5914090 the heroes of this great artistic labor tend to be semimonastic intro verts who like woods beloved henry james and gustave flaubert toil with the doors shut and locked in soundproof splendid isolation attentive to the subtle frictions among nouns and adjectival phrases
5914091 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
5914092 franks portrait of the conservative movement sacrifices complexity to caricature
5914093 with rare exceptions like john kenneth galbraith conservatives have been the best satirists in thomas frank
5914094 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
5914095 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
5914096 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
5914097 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
5914098 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent
5914099 it is a bold historian who writes a history of the caucasus as events of the past week have made all too clear

5914102 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5914103 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5914104 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5914105 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5914106 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5914107 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5914108 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5914109 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5914110 i saw mom with somebody some man at the restaurant how could she do this
5914111 arey whats there to get so upset about it might be a business meeting or they might be good friends
5914112 look tina first of all there are all the chances that it was purely a friendly meet and in case it was not if your mom was having
5914113 did she ever failed in any of her duties be it being a mother a bread earner your friend or even at times a father she has done everything for you guys so that you two should not face any problems
5914114 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
5914115 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
5914116 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
5914117 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
5914118 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
5914119 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
5914120 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
5914121 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him
5914122 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime
5914123 theyve had junkies break into their homes to fund a quick fix theyve seen young thugs dealing in schoolyards and getting more kids hooked
5914124 the origin was in germany at the turn of the 20th century
5914125 in america workers comp took root later in the 20th century
5914126 from the start it was designed to cover most non agricultural employment where there is a valid employer employee relationship
5914127 this insulates companies from the massive awards a plaintiff can win in other kinds of court
5914128 from the outset of the workers comp system an exclusive remedy rule has applied which severely limits the right of the employee to sue an employer for negligence
5914129 the injured worker has all of their medical expenses covered without deductions or co pays
5914130 doctor bills hospital bills prescription drug bills all of that is supposed to be covered
5914131 after a waiting period which varies by state and is never over seven days
5914132 workers comp covers all the medicals and indemnity expenses for the lifetime of the claim
5914133 there are rules in each state defining limits to benefits for injuries not deemed permanent in virtually all states the injured worker and their insurer can agree to settle a claim leaving the insurer without any further open obligation in some states many if not most permanent cases are settled
5914134 what are often not covered or covered but with often complicated exclusions are mental claims and disease claims such as cancers from exposure to toxins
5914135 generally these are not covered but court decisions have addressed these issues in virtually all states and these decisions rather than the language of the law tend to govern
5914136 the most common ground for rejecting claims which can only be done by the insurer is that the injury was not caused by work
5914137 a proficient adjuster should be able to make that determination perhaps with the help of a doctor who inspects the worker
5914138 in many states the adjuster can delay making such a decision for months
5914139 and if the adjuster decides then to deny the claim the already paid benefits to the worker are not returned
5914140 under workers comp law a person is not entitled to get benefits unless they are an employee
5914141 im not arguing about medical issues im not arguing about doctors im arguing that this person is not an employee
5914142 and the rules set largely by court decisions vary by states
5914143 typically an independent contractor is being paid to complete a job to complete a task and is not being paid by the hour
5914144 if i hire a painter to paint my house im not supervising that persons every brush stroke
5914145 injuries by undocumented workers are usually covered by workers compensation
5914146 the concierge desk the porters the superintendents the maintenance people are all typically employees of the building
5914147 a lot of employees come up with phony claims a lot of doctors support the phony claims some employers take advantage and dont report everyone trying to save premiums and fees
5914148 if a person who has had a stroke can walk across a room i should be able to run 20 miles
5914149 when you run you delve a little deeper into yourself and empathize when they hit their wall and think i just cant do it
5914150 he is aging very gracefully healthy and smart much better than i did at his age he is national class
5914151 its training and leading up to a race for me
5914152 ive always had good pulmonary lung capacity its been my strength its carried me through a lot
5914153 it was kind of half hearted i was not prepared
5914154 i dont know exactly what it was that brought me back
5914155 thats a tough one a buddy of mine got me to run with him in the 2006 tucson 10 miler i did 1 07 and things snowballed from there
5914156 people who cant walk or dress themselves lots of stroke victims amputees hip fractures
5914157 i did greet him by asking if he was ready to go to the stadium to start training
5914158 ive played at the distinctive homes dome before when i was in under 14s with eltham where i played my junior ball
5914159 they had our names up on the board and i thought that was pretty cool
5914160 it was a sticky situation because obviously i was trying to do the nba thing and that fell at the same time as boomers work outs
5914161 i would love to have been a part of the team but i couldnt come back for any of the try outs it hurt me to watch them walk out at the opening ceremony i felt like i was missing out on an olympics games
5914162 my goal is definitely to be a part of that boomers team next time
5914163 my primary goal is to help the 36ers as best we can next season first and foremost
5914164 beyond that everything will be a byproduct of how hard i work in the next couple of years
5914165 the nba or europe those opportunities will open up as a byproduct of what i do here
5914166 it definitely was a good thing that mum and dad and the family and anyone who is close to the family could travel to games here whenever they like
5914167 yeah they havent said otherwise so absolutely im going out there treating it like that you have to
5914168 i dont really let myself feel anything about it were kind of crunched for time so im just spending as much time as i can getting ready for chicago
5914169 sept 7 i dont know what that is that the first day of the season i keep telling you guys that this is camp this is every day this is my job to get ready for thursday if i let myself get caught up in stuff that i cant control like who plays sept 7 im really letting my performance be affected on thursday
5914170 all were doing is keeping the same process weve been doing
5914171 youre asking the wrong person dont know not sure theres three of us reps are hard to come by right now its difficult
5914172 ive had my reps out here and im just trying to take advantage of them not sure what theyre thinking or whats going on upstairs
5914173 this decision is going to be based on who we feel at this point gives us the best chance to win
5914174 the punishment of fading into footnote obscurity a numbered ward of the state he did not destroy
5914175 it is a chance to get everyone out to relive their memories let the blood flow wear your bobby socks and have fun
5914176 we are trialling the event this year to gauge the level of interest from the public
5914177 we are looking to stimulate the economy during the quieter times of the year and we have identified that september is a shoulder period that could do with an injection into our economy
5914178 be still and know your life has been pre recorded so chill out know that you are victorious and can never lose no matter what is happening all around you keep your eyes on the light and know youre in a fixed fight
5914179 with jesus on my side i can never lose no matter what i go through i now trust and stand to begin again for this is my time this is my new season and it is truly my turn and so it is
5914180 its going to be a different feel because were doing five days
5914181 its not going to change its not a family show were still going to be on after 9pm torchwoods a family show if you think its appropriate for your children to watch it we just deal with issues of life but no its not going to be toned down were still going to be edgy because thats what we are
5914182 gt dropped out to be in the doubtless crappy law and order uk but thats just me now what do you think
5914183 with all due respect to cardiff city theres only so many options in a place of that size for stories compared to a huge city like london
5914184 but how many people are willing to make a commitment to watch something over five consecutive nights these days whats the dramatic point that cant be served by weekly episodes or are they relying on everyone recording it or iplayering it
5914185 we have handed the case to the police and also submitted our findings to our disciplinary board
5914186 i feel like a sore thumb in a piranha pool in this industry i dont like the way its all run by rich men in their 50s who went to private school its not something i want to be part of im going to retire and become a pedal taxi driver
5914187 i wanted to honor aisha and all the wives of muhammad by giving voice to them remarkable women whose crucial roles in the shaping of islam have so often been ignored silenced by historians
5914188 all i ever really needed to know i learned in kindergarten
5914189 ive been thinking about it and i dont think it will help the nbl that much
5914190 even touch wood with a gold medal i dont think it would help the game that immensely theres still a lot of things to work out and having teams coming in and out of the league theres no stability there
5914191 the fans are going to get fed up with it and i think thats whats happened
5914192 the nbls got a lot of work to do to get to the next level i think off the floor there was a problem whereas on the floor theres some great talent the competitions there but off the floor the marketing and those types of things need to get in order
5914193 the club has accepted a significant payout the likes of which have never been seen in australian sport
5914194 we are pleased this chapter of the clubs history is in the archive and we can put a fullstop on sonny bill williams
5914195 that was something that we were not prepared to negiotiate on
5914196 they didnt want it to be put in there but there was no way we were going to budge on that

5914226 its going to be an interesting time in pietersens career to see how he goes as captain
5914227 i think the one thing i want to make clear at the camp is we have some really tough cricket coming up before england next year
5914228 we have three massive test series in the next year
5914229 i think all three india in india south africa home and away and england in england are going to be as hard as each other
5914230 all our planning for the next 12 months will come from the camp

5914318 the performance of team gb in the olympics is moving beyond the sublime and towards the ridiculous
5914319 we are british for heavens sake how are we supposed to cope with such a relentless diet of good news such an unprecedented glut of world beating performances
5914320 the only difficulty as the games bring yet more medal chances will be in squeezing so many names into the next edition of the queens honours list
5914321 on monday we proclaimed that it couldnt get any better for britain but it did
5914322 these olympics have offered more than mere diversion from a dismal summer of grey skies and economic gloom
5914323 for whatever candidate comes in second today theres plenty of time to reverse that order

5914357 all told 45 persons in the u s were identified then in 1957 as having fortunes over 100 million in the decade since the centimillionaire population has more than tripled and tose with 150 million or more has grown to 66
5914358 we wanted a press with the speed and flexibility to handle anything we could throw at it
5914359 we thoroughly researched presses from two other manufacturers and the roland 500 over the course of about 18 months we came to the conclusion that manroland was the company we wanted to do business with rather than trying to sell us a machine they really seemed to understand our business what a printers dealing with and whats important to us
5914360 when he came home and told me he wanted to open his own printing operation i thought he had lost his mind
5914361 neither jim nor i knew anything about printing but we borrowed 10 000 on a handshake and started the business
5914362 weve managed to deliver award winning work including a benny for an annual report in 2006 with aging equipment but it took time to get there very often with overtime although we have complete color management throughout the shop getting the presses to hold color sometimes had us pulling our hair out we wasted a lot of paper time and energy
5914363 about 80 90 percent of our work originates with creative design or ad agencies
5914364 designers often push the envelope in choosing stocks as well as color coatings and other combinations in order to achieve a unique high end look they are very critical of the work because they know what prints supposed to look like so they demand for it to look that way
5914365 they really wanted to work with us and help us be successful they also seemed more concerned about quality all the way from standards and specifications in their production facility to what they deliver when its on your floor
5914366 the ease with which it handled our forms the press didnt have a hard time with any of it also manrolands roi was the most thorough and transparent easy to follow and understand i could shoot holes in it find issues raise questions and we would come up with viable options
5914367 we planned to be down a couple of weeks during installation
5914368 they kept the 40 inch miehle operating with a diesel generator running outside so we wouldnt have any downtime
5914369 the new roland 500 is very creative friendly make readies are great
5914370 when you make changes in prepress this machine learns with you it remembers the next time and does things for you saving time on subsequent runs youre 90 percent there right away on most setups you can easily save an hour per job
5914371 the key is how your provider deals with adversity in terms of both speed and expertise manroland couldnt be better they have great people doing service
5914372 we find ourselves experimenting doing different screenings pushing to see what more it can do we handle more jobs more efficiently with better production than i ever anticipated
5914373 we are the opposite about 80 percent is uncoated and were pushing use of more recycled papers in fact we recently ordered 20 000 lbs of 100 percent recycled as long as we can get the look were getting now everyone wins and were getting it without uv which also makes us a bit unusual although uv doesnt have vocs there are other environmental issues that concern us most of the inks we use are vegetable or soy based our process inks are 60 percent vegetable or soy all of our pms inks are 100 percent from renewable resources
5914374 the press has more than lived up to our expectations and were delivering for clients much easier now

5914377 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5914378 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president in truth id had the ambition for a long time
5914379 how do i get him to consider me as more
5914380 our position is that we cant recommend the players tour pakistan for the champions trophy
5914381 obviously we put a position forward a few weeks ago to the icc to that affect but we said we would keep an open mind with the taskforce which we did we heard them speak on friday now we have had a chance to digest it all our position hasnt changed
5914382 we have concerns with every aspect of this tournament at the moment
5914383 if theres the desire to build a really tall building they have the ability to do that in the north end where it wont affect the historic context of the citys core
5914384 were dropping these words from our vocabulary and replacing them with the try sisters ill try and youll try
5914385 students who drop out often believe i cant or theyve been told that you cant so i wanted to have a funeral to give these students a fresh perspective on school
5914386 were committed to this as part of our high school reform initiative
5914387 it eliminates the one size fits all approach of learning in the traditional classroom
5914388 the performance learning center allows students to learn at their own pace because the cookie cutter approach doesnt work for all students
5914389 our focus here is not only on academics but we want to prep students for post secondary education or their chosen career path
5914390 our goal is for the students to come in take their classes and move on
5914391 the school system is moving in the right direction by giving these students an alternate learning setting
5914392 they have the traditional schools and the early college high schools this is the missing piece of the puzzle
5914393 you have to make sure that no matter what the people in the courts have a place to go

5914397 a blind trust businesswise is not very different from this grantor trust but youre taxed on passive income versus income
5914398 identification of each trust asset if known to the beneficiary from which income was received by the beneficiary in excess of 500
5914399 in my interpretation of the law you only have two choices you either disclose your assets if its in a regular trust or you have a blind trust

5914473 i wasnt sure i could really make it back at times
5914474 im not going to put a number on it but we have to have a very good road trip
5914475 you play believing youre going to make it to the playoffs
5914476 watching the team lose that was probably the most difficult part of being away
5914477 the solution is in that bullpen now we feel the answer is there
5914478 he needs more rest and his days off are too important
5914479 i prefer to be a starter but if the team needed someone id do it
5914480 they never really said anything to me but id do whatevers needed
5914481 im considering everyone from the gulf coast league to triple a
5914482 it starts to feel a little more comfortable the more times you go out there
5914483 the solution is in that bullpen now we feel the answer is there
5914484 he needs more rest and his days off are too important
5914485 i prefer to be a starter but if the team needed someone id do it
5914486 they never really said anything to me but id do whatevers needed
5914487 im considering everyone from the gulf coast league to triple a
5914488 it starts to feel a little more comfortable the more times you go out there
5914489 no matter what the distance is if its a 50 yarder or a 20 yarder you cant forget the mechanics maybe i thought because it was a pretty short one it was automatic and you can never just assume its going to go in every time
5914490 i really wasnt obviously every week theres some things you can learn from and work to improve on but watching it critically i thought it was another step in the right direction
5914491 no matter what the distance is if its a 50 yarder or a 20 yarder you cant forget the mechanics maybe i thought because it was a pretty short one it was automatic and you can never just assume its going to go in every time
5914492 i really wasnt obviously every week theres some things you can learn from and work to improve on but watching it critically i thought it was another step in the right direction
5914493 its loose actually it feels a lot better than it has
5914494 its loose actually it feels a lot better than it has
5914495 unmerited divine assistance given humans for their regeneration or sanctification
5914496 in the past d amp d has been a scapegoat for neglectful parents with absurd claims of occultism and violent behaviour although fashion has shifted most of this blame to computer games in the last 10 years
5914497 the ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak
5914498 the candidates want to stoke the speculation with nods hints and winks to get as much visibility as they can for the ultimate announcement
5914499 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5914500 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5914501 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
5914502 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
5914503 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
5914504 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
5914505 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
5914506 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
5914507 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
5914508 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
5914509 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
5914510 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
5914511 hes disgraced himself hes an embarrassment to the clayton county police department his credibility and integrity as an officer is gone and i have no use for him
5914512 his behavior is unbecoming of that of a police officer
5914513 this turn of events from hero to someone who defrauds a nation is just baffling i dont know how he got from one point to the other
5914514 we havent been able to get in touch with him
5914515 he he he naw guys we wuz just shittin ya nothing to see here move along all a bunch of crapola
5914516 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
5914517 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
5914518 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
5914519 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
5914520 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
5914521 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
5914522 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
5914523 their hosts included an entertainer with pink hair and a former topless model
5914524 the girls were very nice we all had a lap dance individually id like to go again
5914525 society has changed fundamentally and the measure of it is that the official fatwa religious edict of old no longer has the hold it had
5914526 a girl or young man who hears a fatwa doesnt just obey he goes to google and hears other opinions and discusses
5914527 do you know the city will be larger than washington
5914528 saudi arabia today doesnt offer the kind of services that are required
5914529 there is a lack of infrastructure and basic urban aesthetic beauty is also missing
5914530 we have 60 percent of our population under 30 and these people need places to live so we are going to create the educational opportunities for them to come study and work
5914531 they are white elephants and not economically sustainable without huge subsidies
5914532 its hard to find serious economists who arent in the pay of the saudis who think it is sustainable
5914533 the king goes to parliament to talk about the need for women to participate but its all nonsense
5914534 the king has good intentions but when it goes down to lower levels there is resistance
5914535 we are putting our faith in king abdullah because obviously hes a reformist
5914536 he represents optimism and tolerance and a progressive way of thinking
5914537 if iran involves itself more in iraq and the americans tried to back the shiites well resort once more to the religious establishment
5914538 prince christian had taken off his bathing shorts and didnt want to put them back on
5914539 the crown princess and crown prince became aware that there were photographers who had taken photos
5914540 they asked them not to use these photos and the photographers said ok fine
5914541 just to make sure that everything was ok i called three weeklies in denmark the three magazines that were present at the time and asked them if they would please not use those photographs
5914542 two said of course they would not but the third said they would
5914543 every summer the queen hosts her family her sisters and their husbands and children and grandchildren
5914544 the highlight of that event is the royals invite the press to come and take some pictures of the whole family
5914545 when the press show up at this event there is no frederik and mary when the queen is asked why theyre not there she says they are stuck in traffic
5914546 clearly what happened was that frederik and mary decided to boycott this event because the editor went ahead and published these pictures
5914547 it would have been tempting but its not the case the two incidents had nothing to do with each other
5914548 they were simply late because of a misunderstanding about the exact time of the photo session
5914549 and now were talking about a chance to win the fedexcup
5914550 the tour said they wanted more volatility but are they setting themselves up for a guy like me
5914551 have i had a better year than padraig harrington no but the playoffs arent all about who had the best year its who is playing well in the playoffs the new york giants certainly were not the best team in the league but they won the super bowl
5914552 i seem to be the biggest procrastinator in the world when it means something
5914553 its a wonder i ever got married and had kids but you know they give you 42 weeks just because i waited until the last week doesnt bother me im elated to be where im at
5914554 people with normal cholesterol levels and no family history of cardiovascular diseases should not worry about eating one or two eggs a day
5914555 absolutely appalling returned and delivered at least one final blow to the unconscious mr lillicrap after the other offenders had left the scene
5914556 renowned for her managerial skill the discipline she demands from those around her and her tight control of all things labour undertakes under her leadership
5914557 she holds generally left wing beliefs with foreign policy perspectives forged during the vietnam war she does not trust those outside a small circle in labour and her chief of staff heather simpson is known as the second most powerful person in nz known as h2
5914558 i thought it was quite funny but as i say if i was to have my cvs on other leaders fall off the back of trucks you would all have a lot of laughs as well
5914559 i am a bit surprised that dfat would draw up something that was clearly written about the time of the last election there you go maybe they need to be more efficient
5914560 ms taylor is at home and happy and busier than ever

5914583 back in jamaica they used to tease me that i was bad luck
5914584 id show up at a match and jamaica would lose i remember going to watch squash once and as soon as i walked in we started losing i went to the bathroom and we started winning again i came back and we were down again
5914585 the track and field stars in our country are like the dream team in america

5914587 maurice told me he was really going to go for it tonight
5914588 were still going to try to get tickets but i told everybody if i have to stay back and watch it on tv im ok with that
5914589 but maurice just laughs at that talk he told me hes going to prove im not bad luck here hes going to run well
5914590 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
5914591 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
5914592 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
5914593 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
5914594 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
5914595 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
5914596 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
5914597 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
5914598 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
5914599 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
5914600 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
5914601 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
5914602 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
5914603 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
5914604 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
5914605 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
5914606 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
5914607 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
5914608 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
5914609 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
5914610 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
5914611 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
5914612 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
5914613 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
5914614 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now
5914615 oppose legislation relating to climate change that includes a net increase in state or federal revenue
5914616 new jerseys tax and regulatory climate is already chasing jobs from this state
5914617 we should be looking at the concrete economic indicators that show our states economy is in trouble and we should be taking steps to help people who are losing jobs and being forced out of their homes by this states anti economic growth agenda not making matters worse
5914618 the good news from america most environmentalists are indeed leftists who support the redistribution of wealth and believe in a simpler lifestyle
5914619 seemed to be a step backwards towards confusion rather than a progress towards resolution
5914620 i am really amazed that the nobel peace prize has been given on scientifically incorrect conclusions by people who are not geologists
5914621 the ipcc has actually become a closed circuit it doesnt listen to others it doesnt have open minds
5914622 when i put forward my points in the morning some ipcc official got up to say that what i was saying was nonsense see when we have that sort of attitude that sort of dogma against a scientific observation that would not actually end up in very very positive debate we should maintain our sense of proportion maintain our sense of objectivity allow a discussion not have fixed mindset about global warming
5914623 i think the scientific community is putting way too much faith on these models especially given the fact that they have not been able to predict 5 day weather forecasts yet and weather systems are simpler than the climate and every 5 days they have a chance to test the model and improve it
5914624 a lot of the predictions made by modelers and models do not match very well to the longer term geologic record and even more scary most atmospheric scientists are not aware of that
5914625 we know temperature goes up and down we know there is tremendous amount of natural variations but for how many years must the planet cool before we begin to understand we politicians and scientists that the planet is not warming for how many years must cooling go on
5914626 the challenge for west virginia the challenge for coal producing states and nations is that as historically produced coal is a dirty fuel and is regarded as a dirty fuel
5914627 and there are environmental issues associated with the production and consumption of coal
5914628 if you want to do energy well in an environmentally sound fashion go to west virginia go to appalachia
5914629 we all win in that equation thats our great opportunity
5914630 the physically reality is that we cannot bridge to the future for decades if not hundreds of years without coal as part of the equation
5914631 if you accept that premise then your choices are how do we do coal well how do we do coal clean how do we capture the opportunities for coal
5914632 carbon sequestration is going to double the cost of coal fired power
5914633 one of the coal presidents said it is at least 15 maybe 20 years away from being commercially viable
5914634 there are a myriad of legal issues that are unresolved whos going to take the liability if it comes back out of the ground and the energy it takes ive heard estimates it could take 15 or 20 of the power of the power plant makes to strip out the co 2 thats going to raise the cost of electricity
5914635 im not sure that we can really appease the individuals that want to see coal eliminated abolished from the energy mix of this country
5914636 but those individuals and groups that have concerns about the environment or the impacts of mining certainly we can be more responsive to those concerns
5914637 right now we dont have a comprehensive bill out there
5914638 we havent been allowed to vote on anything that i think is going to address high gasoline prices and dependence on foreign oil and any time we do get something its a fight to get anything related to coal in there
5914639 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5914640 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
5914641 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
5914642 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
5914643 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
5914644 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
5914645 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future
5914646 we see him on the news but we dont pay much attention to him
5914647 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
5914648 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
5914649 mudgee is currently the fastest growing coal producing region in nsw
5914650 if planned expansion of the three mines ulan wilpinjong and moolarben goes ahead there will be between forty and fifty million tonnes of coal produced per year from this area
5914651 there is two and a half tonnes of co2 produced from every tonne of coal which means the mudgee region could be responsible for the release of 150 million tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere
5914652 it creates severe subsidence and interferes with the ground water system
5914653 subsidence can also initiate tremors which can be the equivalent of small earthquakes
5914654 we want to extend the goulburn river national park to include the drip gorge and land currently held in lease by the moolarben mine
5914655 when you see the enormous devastation caused to a pristine environment by coal mining companies its outrageous enough
5914656 but when you convert the practice into greenhouse gas emissions its terrifying and australia is one of the biggest emitters in the world
5914657 we are prepared to trade fire with them until we are decimated if they cannot finish us we will finish them
5914658 we are prepared to kill we are prepared to be killed
5914659 the government has been deceiving the milf for a long time
5914660 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5914661 i shall dream of a world where craptacularone is more than just a human search engine or a free online spell checker
5914662 indeed if the board lacked such authority the boards ability fo administer the fire department would be seriously undermined
5914663 weve tried this morning to lure the whale out this morning but it has failed she said
5914664 it will never contribute more than a fraction of our needs
5914665 generates about 240 billion in annual revenues and employs a quarter million germans germanys wind industry created 8 000 jobs in 2007 alone and one recent study suggested that the renewable sector could provide more work than the auto industry currently the nations biggest employer by 2020
5914666 nixon was bad enough without fictionalizing him and demonizing him
5914667 well no but you have to ask yourself what it means
5914668 president elect mccain will be making a very big mistake by appointing joe leiberman as his vp
5914669 you ever notice how anyone who stands between them and power is an evil idiot bent on the destruction of the world funny how that works
5914670 actually the far right often accuses chavez not only of wanting to take over south america but often insinuate that hes working with iran to install nukes the far right often accuses syria of attacking us interests granted considering israel is our 51st state thats not unexpected as for mugabe the far right has been rather silent i guess its more important to pretend that were all georgians than to take an actual stand on mugabes horrific abuses
5914671 were on the brink of a financial meltdown i o u s a boldly examines the rapidly growing national debt and its consequences for the united states and its citizens
5914672 our nation suffers from a fiscal cancer that threatens the future economic well being of our country children and grandchildren
5914673 this isnt just a financial issue its a moral issue it is immoral to keep kicking this can down the road for younger generations to grapple with its time for real action rather than more rhetoric
5914674 i o u s a live with warren buffett pete peterson amp dave walker
5914675 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
5914676 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
5914677 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
5914678 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
5914679 pay any price bear any burden in the defense of liberty
5914680 this new supercar and the exclusive collection lp640 represent a natural evolution of excellence for both versace and lamborghini through the creation of these unique one of a kind projects
5914681 update to schedule for wednesday knut grimsrud will not be able to join us at
5914682 an update with a few more bloggers that well see here at idf om malik
5914683 whoever said it would not overclock i am wondering if it will overclock as well
5914684 i think with all of the candidates they all have had coaching experience and they all have playing experience
5914685 all but one has head coaching experience we feel really good about these final four we think all four of them would fit in with the university
5914686 i think the amount of time we have taken on the search goes to show how important this decision is
5914687 i dont see it as any more challenging as trying to recruit guys to come play at the virginia military institute
5914688 i really think it can be a diamond in the rough
5914689 i think there is so much potential there their academic performance rate has suffered a little bit but i think someone has to go in there and retool some things

5914737 democrats on the ground and their operators from the democratic national committee and the state organization and the gore campaign deliberately and systematically scrutinized for challenge every military absentee ballot and knocked out as many as they could on whatever technicality they could find or even invent

5914786 be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue do not now seek the answers which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them and the point is to live everything live the questions now perhaps you will then gradually without noticing it live along some distant day into the answer

5914802 there is no question there is a lot more excitement in our state for sen obama than there is for sen mccain r ariz

5914839 the use of reason allows for a legitimate diversity in our prudential judgments
5914840 these choices include elective abortion euthanasia physician assisted suicide the destruction of embryonic human beings in stem cell research human cloning and same sex marriage
5914841 such acts are judged to be intrinsically evil that is evil in and of themselves regardless of our motives or the circumstances they constitute an attack against innocent human life as well as marriage and family
5914842 in light of the above we would commit moral evil if we were to vote for a candidate who takes a permissive stand on those actions that are intrinsically evil when there is a morally acceptable alternative
5914843 so when there is no choice of a candidate that avoids supporting intrinsically evil actions especially elective abortion we should vote in such a way as to allow the least harm to innocent human life and dignity
5914844 but we all got fired up by that press conference

5914856 a lot of companies are unaware of where their catalogue paper comes from
5914857 we want to work with them and pressure them to do the right thing by adopting sustainable policies
5914858 at first they werent responsive but then they saw how it would benefit them
5914859 consumer opinion has a lot of power to influence companies
5914860 we continue to work within the supply chain to promote certification of forests and fibre and we are engaged with our suppliers to continuously improve on our prudent use of natural resources
5914861 sears has yet to make any policy changes so well continue to lobby them
5914862 has a habit of straying off message and making impolitic comments
5914863 pretty deep knowledge of pretty much every big foreign policy question
5914864 obama has shown himself more not less in need of an attack dog able to engage mccain on national security
5914865 e vents in georgia and pakistan have made the prospect that obama will choose
5914866 if obama wanted to make a truly big statement before the convention he might want to risk alienating democrats by picking a republican running mate
5914867 than by choosing a member of the other to be his running mate
5914868 fill the bill of the excitement of the newcomer on the national stage
5914869 p ick a running mate who is a conservative white guy or a general or a republican
5914870 obama is likely to choose someone relatively safe and avoid taking a chance with a game changing selection
5914871 someone who would fill perceived holes in his r sum
5914872 who would reinforce his promise of change or one who might help him win a contested state
5914873 were very pleased that the court recognized that the mbtas legal arguments were meritless
5914874 the mbtas attempts to silence these students were not only misguided but blatantly unconstitutional
5914875 the judge today correctly found that it was unlikely that the cfaa would apply to security researchers giving an academic talk
5914876 a presentation at a security conference is not some sort of computer intrusion its protected speech and vital to the free flow of information about computer security vulnerabilities silencing researchers does not improve security the vulnerability was there before the students discovered it and would remain in place regardless of whether the students publicly discussed it or not
5914877 the only thing keeping the students and the mbta from working together cooperatively to resolve the fare payment card security issues is the lawsuit itself
5914878 the mbta would be far better off focusing on improving the mbtas fare payment security instead of pursuing needless litigation
5914879 the first time i read it i said to myself i have to direct it one day and now here i am
5914880 its comedic and its tragic and its quirky all at the same time
5914881 i think the language is a little more accessible than shakespeare
5914882 i think people can identify with the follies of the main character her naivete and her impetuousness those are characteristics we all have to some degree and the language is just beautiful i think its almost more beautiful than shakespeare
5914883 the current economic situation has laid down a challenge for the coming year but this is a challenge the new zealand wine industry is ready to meet
5914884 there is huge potential to build on the significant successes to date
5914885 each year we have made projections about sales and growth and each year these are fulfilled and often surpassed
5914886 the focus on premium quality is clear with the average bottle of new zealand wine sold in the united kingdom now stg6 47 nz17 17 which is stg2 09 nz5 54 ahead of the nearest competitor
5914887 as consumers become increasingly more discerning the quality of new zealand wine increasingly stands out
5914888 it says more about them than anything how they think how they envision their governing and so this is probably the most important thing they do until they show themselves in debates
5914889 theyll walk you in and theyll say ok weve got a question about your tax return or we have a question about this stock that you owned that you sold or we have a question about this speech that you gave or this vote that you took or this veto that you made
5914890 the spouses are an issue that was probably the one thing that surprised me the most is how much what your spouse has done said written makes a difference
5914891 you need to have a maximum impact around your convention when all eyes are on your party
5914892 kemp complemented dole in that he helped promote his pro growth economic ideas of cutting taxes and he also helped energize the party
5914893 anything that gets in the way that has the potential to diminish that youd rather not have
5914894 this cycle probably the best time to do it is on the friday afternoon when the democrats leave denver
5914895 why not start to squash their bounce and ride it through the weekend into minneapolis
5914896 theres a little bit of stagecraft that goes on at the end of the process to not only make sure it has an element of surprise but to really have a wow factor
5914897 why do you shoot so many images then narrow it down to about 30
5914898 its extremely hard the younger generation now are pretty much the lifeline of niue and we are in need of trying to keep them here
5914899 thus the covenant that god made with the jewish people through moses remains eternally valid for them
5914900 to the jewish people whom god first chose to hear his word belong the sonship the glory the covenants the giving of the law the worship and the promises to them belong the patriarchs and of their race according to the flesh is the christ
5914901 catholics understand that all previous covenants that god made with the jewish people have been fulfilled in jesus christ through the new covenant established through his sacrificial death on the cross
5914902 to ensure our national security economic prosperity and clean environment by breaking our dependence on foreign oil
5914903 the hands that install roofs can also install solar panels the hands that build todays cars can also build the next generation of fuel efficient vehicles barack obama will create 5 million jobs developing homegrown energy technologies
5914904 one of the most important ways of positioning on global warming is to emphasize the jobs issue since it appeals to people who you might not otherwise reach with your message
5914905 on the big issues that our nation faces some sacrifice will be required not only from you individually but from the nation as a whole there is no magic bullet to our energy problems for example no perfect energy source
5914906 the call to sacrifice for the nations greater good remains an imperative of citizenship sadly in recent years in the midst of a war on two fronts this call to service never came after 9 11 we were asked to shop
5914907 plenty of recent media polls demonstrate that drilling for more american oil particularly offshore drilling has the potential to be a very effective wedge issue for republicans as a way to reduce the price of gas
5914908 for the immediate short term right now forcing house democrats to vote on drilling offshore and in wilderness areas or exposing their refusal to hold this vote would be a potentially strong wedge issue that would split the democrats win among independents and excite the republicans
5914909 the republican echo chamber has done a great job on this
5914910 this intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic independence and the very future of our nation
5914911 the energy crisis is real it is worldwide it is a clear and present danger to our nation these are the facts and we must face them
5914912 thou shalt not talk honestly to the american people about sacrifice
5914913 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
5914914 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
5914915 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
5914916 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
5914917 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
5914918 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
5914919 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
5914920 we confront more than the usual number of people who dont respond or cant respond people are away from their homes heading back from summer vacation or preparing their children for the start of the school year
5914921 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
5914922 they told me there are going to be resources here
5914923 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
5914924 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
5914925 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
5914926 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
5914927 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
5914928 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
5914929 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
5914930 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote

5914932 bargain hunters have returned to the market on talks that arescue package is on the way and its a good time to bargain huntas many stocks have already fallen to an attractive level
5914933 u s financial worries are responsible for about 80percent of the market fall here today
5914934 the rest is dueto the eroding outlook for corporate earnings for the firsthalf
5914935 they love her but does that look a gold medal to you
5914936 no im your best friend thats why im doing it
5914937 there is only one way to cut taxes and to keep them going down and that is to keep this conservative government in office
5914938 canada is strong canada is independent and canada is back
5914939 it is not an environmental policy it is a tax increase disguised as an environmental policy
5914940 youll never know what can happen but the official election date is october 2009
5914941 i think its time the federal parliament set a date for an election rather than this guessing
5914942 now what do you think youre going to do with that
5914943 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5914944 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5914945 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5914946 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5914947 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5914948 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5914949 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5914950 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5914951 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5914952 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
5914953 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
5914954 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
5914955 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5914956 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5914957 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5914958 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5914959 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5914960 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5914961 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5914962 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
5914963 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
5914964 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
5914965 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
5914966 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
5914967 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
5914968 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
5914969 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
5914970 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
5914971 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
5914972 page visit this page every time you come to ksm and each visit you should check out a video and one of the sites linked on that page thank you tim construction zone hardheads required
5914973 yo fui candidato presidencial apoyado por los dos partidos pero esas cosas se maduran toman tiempo y al final caen por su propio peso
5914974 the next thing i heard was a big loud crash and i turned right beside me and i turned and i looked and here was this white spot with spider web effect and the only thing i could think of was somebody shot
5914975 surgery was always the last resort but unfortunately thats what it came down to
5914976 i am also shattered that i cant lead the australian davis cup team in chile in our bid to rejoin the world group and hope that the boys can still come through with a great win
5914977 i am looking forward to playing again in january in my home country and using that as a springboard to compete at my best again on the world stage for at least a couple of more years
5914978 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
5914979 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
5914980 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
5914981 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
5914982 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
5914983 its not going to happen if youre coming for that youll be disappointed
5914984 hands down the best property management company in san francisco for rental property as well as condominium associations
5914985 all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
5914986 let him who is without sin cast the first stone
5914987 all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
5914988 did you err when you attributed the cross in the dirt story to yourself and if not why didnt you ever mention it before 1999
5914989 why werent you sequestered during senator obamas conversation with pastor rick warren as you were supposed to have been
5914990 if the bear dna study was such a waste of taxpayers money why did you vote for it
5914991 do you still believe that evangelical leaders like are agents of intolerance and if so what makes pastor rick warren any different
5914992 you used the forum to repeat your vow to capture and that you knew how to do it my question is if you know how to capture him why havent you shared this knowledge with the current administration
5914993 ryan mengaku aldo bilang begini kepada ryan piro sih kencan ambek koen iku engko tak bayar berapa sih untuk kencan dengan kamu nanti saya bayar karena merasa tersinggung ryan lalu membunuh aldo
5914994 ryan bilang aldo itu sudah pendek hitam tapi sok gaya ryan bilang yang ganteng ganteng banyak yang mau kencan sama aku mana mau aku sama dia aku bunuh saja dia
5914995 kita tidak menemukan kecocokan seperti yang diucapkan ryan informasi itu tidak benar
5914996 padahal mayat asrori ditemukan 29 september 2007 atau sekitar tiga hari setelah dinyatakan hilang oleh keluarganya dua pelaku juga sudah divonis sedangkan satu lagi masih menjalani proses hukum
5914997 mayat mayat korban ryan rata rata dibunuh tahun 2007 mayat mayat itu umumnya masih ada dagingnya bahkan zaki masih cukup utuh termasuk celana dan sabuknya juga masih utuh
5914998 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5914999 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5915000 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5915001 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5915002 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5915003 20 wind by 2030 increasing wind energy contribution to u s electric supply
5915004 would be accomplished solely through private investment with no new customer or corporate taxes or government regulation
5915005 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
5915006 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
5915007 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5915008 to see it in real life and that it exists its just its just unbelievable it really is
5915009 to think back and i made up a character you know and just made it up but suddenly a man came named henry winkler and he made this character real
5915010 jimmy bond had a big jet boat chase in live and let die
5915011 i did quite a few run throughs to practice and whilst banking on one such run the engine cut out i had no steering i therefore continued in a straight line directly into a wooden boat house
5915012 there i was as a fearless 007 hobbling on a cane to my boat and then pretending to be indestructible for the cameras who says i cant act
5915013 he was a huge bond fan and said that he would love to direct one of the films
5915014 hed recently had great success with jaws and close encounters and was considered a very hot property i was rather excited at this news and went looking for film producer albert r cubby broccoli to tell him
5915015 do you know how much of a percentage hed want
5915016 its always been policy that no bond director ever got a slice of the box office profits
5915017 so spielberg went off and made indiana jones who i reckon to be a period james bond
5915018 this area has been hit by sectarian violence for many years and this is also a sectarian related incident
5915019 it will be interesting to see if the obama campaign chooses to campaign heavily in arizona
5915020 surgery was always the last resort but unfortunately thats what it came down to
5915021 i am also shattered that i cant lead the australian davis cup team in chile in our bid to rejoin the world group and hope that the boys can still come through with a great win
5915022 i am looking forward to playing again in january in my home country and using that as a springboard to compete at my best again on the world stage for at least a couple of more years
5915023 its quite unbelievable that a man of 61 knowingly and deliberately set out to have sex with a female under 16
5915024 if communicating is talking thats what we have been doing at practice as we go forward i dont know i dont foresee anything changing if it does its in his court
5915025 its a tough situation especially when you come into a working environment
5915026 but my job is to stay professional im going to do what im supposed to do
5915027 at the beginning of camp i hadnt asked for a trade
5915028 if im not going to be treated fairly if my hard work and loyalty isnt going to be rewarded here then let me go somewhere where its going to be rewarded thats how i feel
5915029 honestly i think it should be completely separated i think thats why we have a department that deals with that
5915030 i feel the exact same way about anquan he is a good football player the cardinals have extended his contract once tried to do it again and our intent is to do it the first chance we get
5915031 anybody that knows me that knows what kind of guy i am they know im a hard worker
5915032 im a guy that does the right things on and off the field im not worried about my reputation being tarnished for me telling the truth
5915033 its a crisis of leadership a crisis of strategy and a crisis of what the future looks like for the supermajors
5915034 they are like a deer caught in headlights they know they have to move but they cant decide where to go
5915035 create a sense of balance and fairness in our tax code
5915036 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
5915037 so i think if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
5915038 if your father had spanked you when you were i kid i wouldnt have to put up with your stupid emotional bullshit and need for my approval
5915039 i feel like i can win the top backup job
5915040 the question is do my coaches believe in me do my teammates believe in me enough thats what im trying to accomplish to earn everybodys respect and everybodys trust
5915041 hes grown now this is an opportunity for him to come out and show that he is his own guy and that he can play with the big boys we have coaches out here for a reason i just try and give him advice from a players perspective
5915042 i think ive been my own guy my entire life
5915043 its just one of those things where we happen to do the same thing play the same position ive always strived to be myself and be my own person i think those that know us best know that were completely different in so many ways
5915044 but it came and went so theres nothing i can do to change it now at this point it really doesnt matter that i didnt get drafted
5915045 ive never had to be a blocker its all new to me having to learn it at this level is really tough but its one of those adjustments i have to make
5915046 we will have to repatriate him back to vietnam because he is on our watch list as persona non grata thai immigration cannot let him enter
5915047 at first this morning he said he wanted to go to singapore then he changed his mind he is still in the transit area
5915048 we need to control him and he will be controlled once he returns to this country
5915049 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5915050 i want gary glitter to be controlled whilst hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
5915051 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5915052 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5915053 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5915054 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
5915055 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5915056 obama mccain discussion with megachurch minister warren has auburn producer director
5915057 demonstrate conclusively that fractal criteria are not useful for authentication
5915058 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5915059 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
5915060 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
5915061 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
5915062 this essential treaty has languished in limbo for more than a decade largely due to the failure of nations in not signing up to what they long ago agreed to
5915063 because most of the worlds transboundary river basins lack adequate legal protection the world needs a global framework for sustainably managing and preventing disputes over those resources and this is the only such framework available in the timescale to help us deal with a growing water crisis
5915064 now when there are increasing water shortages and water quality issues world wide and climate change will only make things worse is when we need to have an effective and widely accepted agreement of global scope covering shared freshwater resources
5915065 this is about national and global security as much as human and water security
5915066 the experts are telling us that rivalries over water will be a significant source of future conflict as indeed they already are
5915067 an essential element of the response to our current water crisis and the looming escalation of that crisis is on the shelf and ready to go all we need is for the worlds nations to match their actions on water to their rhetoric
5915068 the position of the isi has always been ambiguous but they may have been more directly involved in actions in more recent months because of lack of supervision
5915069 with the work of my cold case unit justice delayed is no longer necessarily justice denied but is becoming justice delivered delivered to those who have waited far too long
5915070 lets just show a sandwich and add audio so that we dont have to do much work this month
5915071 if it is an issue that a candidate is put forth we assume that the internal communications have happened but if we were to receive a letter from mayor bloomberg that he doesnt want his name on the ballot we would have to look into the matter to see why the nominee for a party doesnt want to be that nominee
5915072 it is a free country and if chooses to not have his name on the ballot he has every right to do so
5915073 yes bloomberg must consent to this and it will be up to the board of elections
5915074 but we made a promise and we wanted to keep it and we have
5915075 he hasnt made any decisions and hasnt had a chance to speak with party chairman carey campbell yet but this is a call for post partisanship that mayor bloomberg hopes the major parties will hear
5915076 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5915077 oh my gosh the ice caps are melting and were all gonna die before lunch
5915078 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
5915079 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
5915080 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
5915081 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
5915082 along with his southern roots which would go along way to making states like virginia and nc more competitive last but not least jewish voters love al and his presence on the ticket could put florida among other states into play in a major way
5915083 yeah and maybe monkeys will fly out of my butt
5915084 it cheapens the selection of the second office in the land trivializing it to a mere
5915085 alright mr crowley i saw you on msnbc last night hinting that we were all in for a surprise you know something now dont you mikey or youve heard something
5915086 should he take down his website and contact people via direct mail radio and rotary landlines only
5915087 35 of americans over the age of 65 are online if you look at the subset for mccainss race gender and education the number is more like 75
5915088 evidence that passes some invisible threshold to back up their claims the blogs would be empty
5915089 it makes a lot of voters wonder why 2 isnt at the top of the ticket
5915090 rove like democrat whos taking down the precious young candidate of hope
5915091 hey mister if you dont get those ads off the air in the next 48 hours then your military record and my military record are going to become a major issue in this campaign youve invited it and if you insist on permitting this stuff to continue then its going to be an issue
5915092 i know what im going into here for one thing im black ive got a feisty wife you know i mean we all know what theyre going to try to do here
5915093 look its just a continuation of what ive been doing a very positive approach that so far seems to have done what i hoped it would do and anyway thats the kind of guy i am so well just kind of continue
5915094 ive lost my benefits or i cant get them because my kids got a chronic heart problem or something
5915095 hey if you havent signed up as a precinct or block captain please do so the coordinators theyre ready for you give them your telephone and e mail address and so on and so forth well be in touch with you
5915096 well in the final maybe you did that in the primary dukakis but in the final its all its all this kind of stuff
5915097 get it off the air and i really mean it
5915098 i know what im walking into here i know there are some people who are going to try to take advantage of this but were going to take them on
5915099 well who is this guy anyway youre changing youre moving from here to there everywhere
5915100 hey those attacks that are coming from mccain heres the truth
5915101 look give me a summary of the kinds of things we want to say
5915102 i am married to the next president of the united states
5915103 run for governor ok what do i have to do
5915104 by accelerating our enterprise growth and executing well across the portfolio hp delivered a strong third quarter performance
5915105 our global position broad product and services offerings and incremental cost saving opportunities make us confident that well continue to meaningfully expand earnings
5915106 this is not where i should be i should be playing arenas i should be making music
5915107 if you really want to know that is what the record is really all about
5915108 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
5915109 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
5915110 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
5915111 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
5915112 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
5915113 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
5915114 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
5915115 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
5915116 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
5915117 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
5915118 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5915119 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5915120 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5915121 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5915122 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5915123 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5915124 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5915125 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
5915126 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
5915127 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
5915128 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
5915129 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
5915130 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
5915131 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
5915132 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
5915133 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5915134 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5915135 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5915136 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5915137 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
5915138 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5915139 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5915140 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5915141 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5915142 een operatie is altijd de laatste optie geweest maar helaas kon het niet anders
5915143 this is a really cool place and one of the gems of the bay area
5915144 oh so um i guess you didnt need new wheels huh
5915145 come in tomorrow i promise you well have the arm fixed we have the part here and it wont take any time at all
5915146 oops we dont know how long it will take for the part to come in sorry
5915147 this repair since it has to go to the manufacturer will take 6 weeks
5915148 had no choice but to enter into the settlement in order to avoid further incarceration
5915149 if this stands this single handedly undermines the entire civil judicial process in this country

5915152 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5915153 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5915154 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5915155 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5915156 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5915157 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5915158 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5915159 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5915160 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5915161 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5915162 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5915163 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5915164 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5915165 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5915166 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5915167 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5915168 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5915169 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5915170 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5915171 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5915172 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5915173 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5915174 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5915175 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5915176 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5915177 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5915178 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5915179 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5915180 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5915181 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5915182 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5915183 its a challenge theres a long way to go hopefully there is an end to the beginning
5915184 it will provide them a place to stay together associate together
5915185 i think its something thats time has come for birmingham and something that can really benefit the community

5915193 there has been much talk to date about transpromo and now we are really starting to see traction as companies move to implement real applications
5915194 our joint program with the cmo council demonstrates infoprints unique approach to create both awareness and education and is a perfect complement to our leading color technology software professional services and customer support we are working to help our customers learn about the right solution for their business and how to form stronger and longer relationships with target audiences using the personalized and captive power of transpromo
5915195 theres been a lot of growth over the last four or five years and a lot of it comes from reaching outside of our 20 mile market that i grew up in
5915196 whats interesting is as the internet has killed some printers and some other people who are in manufacturing its helped us communicate with customers who are a four hour ten hour twelve hour drive away
5915197 we were on a time crunch and they really stepped up to the plate
5915198 you are a lover of words someday you should write a book
5915199 what are you doing in this section of the store
5915200 oh that h amp m doesnt have any mens clothes
5915201 you know how none of the employees at the h amp m in san francisco are over 100 lbs well i dont think any of the ones here are under 100 lbs
5915202 hands down the best property management company in san francisco for rental property as well as condominium associations
5915203 you are lucky they have a policy that the max increase is 10 each year
5915204 i had to find an apartment in a hurry so i only compared the avalon at mission bay and the paramount can you believe dollar for dollar the paramount is definitely more bang for your buck for the same price you get not only the same square feet same high views but much better designed common areas more luxurious lobby and more high end amenities all around compared to the paramount avalon feels like a dorm and avalon is very expensive and gives you less i compared at least 3 units at 3 price points at each building i signed at the paramount right away not to mention the friendly and superhelpful stellar leasing staff at the paramount im sold
5915205 ive been taking my clothing to dollar cleaners since they charged a dollar to clean and press dress shirts its 1

5915210 i dont want to be happy because then that means you will be sad along with the good comes the bad those emotions feelings are too unstable
5915211 fine i just want to be satisfued that is my favorite emotion state
5915212 we have grown our business by always investing in the latest automated technology available for prepress printing and finishing
5915213 we are always looking for efficiencies with production and technology that is the most environmentally sound on the market the new sunday press is the latest example and we look forward to passing on the print quality productivity environmental and efficiency advantages of this high pagination system to our customers
5915214 we appreciate the skill and the professionalism goss international google brought to the installation process
5915215 our teams have worked very well together and that teamwork was the key ingredient in the on time start up of this large technologically advanced press system
5915216 adding another highly regarded sales professional such as jenny dowdy coincident with the addition of uv coating are two more important elements in the growth of our company
5915217 in fact we were able to drop the processing time for a 50 000 record job from three hours down to just eight minutes
5915218 as the number and sophistication of our customers projects continued to grow we needed a more robust composition engine to manage the flow of variable print jobs to our digital printing equipment
5915219 with fusionpro direct we can optimize the flow of work to each of our machines and provide accurate turnaround times for any size job if you have any kind of volume at all you need fusionpro direct
5915220 our customers product mix has changed over the years and muller martini saw the need for a new generation of saddle stitching technology designed to address those changes and create extensive growth and profit opportunities for printers and binderies
5915221 muller martini engineers as they have done so many times before in setting new productivity benchmarks recognized the need for more efficient handling of signatures and as a result we designed revolutionary new feeders for our primera saddle stitchers that will enable our customers to produce a larger variety of products in the fastest and most profitable way possible
5915222 we are the leading premium paper company in north america and with that comes a level of accountability that we have not only chosen to meet but to exceed our whiting mill was an obvious choice for this project because it represents over half of neenahs fine paper production including the companys classic crest and classic linen flagship brands
5915223 our commitment to the environment is based on real internal change such as investing in innovative energy efficient upgrades and manufacturing processes versus simply buying carbon credits this project supports that strategy and complements existing initiatives already in place at our other manufacturing sites where we burn biomass and utilize local hydro solar and wind power
5915224 we fully recognize our responsibility in managing the natural resources that are used in manufacturing our premium papers and we will continue to lead the way in our industry in managing those resources in a sustainable and productive manner
5915225 we believe the enterprise solution is the future of innerworkings
5915226 our solution is made to fit large organizations recognizing that buying print is not part of their core competency
5915227 when were out prospecting its not uncommon to see 100 different employees of a company involved in the buying process theres no centralized area to analyze whos buying and to see how well they are doing
5915228 the high production capacity of modern printing presses and the continued further development of paper and printing ink require increasingly standardized production conditions
5915229 as a printer i know what problems can be caused if the humidity in the pressroom is too low these can include paper distortion electrostatic charges and register differences to me it was obvious that optimal humidity of 45 50 must be provided in our training center
5915230 optimal humidity is a prerequisite for printing and testing after final assembly if the humidity is too low the test runs are disrupted spoilage increases and both time and money are wasted
5915231 reliability hygiene and service are the key characteristics of the draabe system we werent impressed by either the technology or the available maintenance concepts of other systems
5915232 we also like to familiarize our customers from around the world with the subject of humidity
5915233 all system modules including service come from a single source and are perfectly tailored to each other this provides reliability
5915234 the correct air humidity promotes a very pleasant and healthy indoor environment when i have to talk a lot i particularly enjoy the pleasant air in the training center
5915235 in 10 years there has never been a fault in the draabe system it always runs perfectly
5915236 we needed a robust and cost efficient solution for our new daily edition after careful evaluation of available editorial solutions we decided to adopt woodwing smart connection as it fits our requirements best
5915237 it used to be that only wealthy high circulation newspapers could afford an editorial workflow system
5915238 by producing an affordable open source editorial workflow system woodwing has given many small to medium sized publications access to the latest in newsroom technology their partner in the region serioustec does a terrific job with installation and theyre extremely responsive when it comes to customer support all of this allowed us to accomplish what might have seemed impossible switching from bi weekly to daily publication going from 50 pages a month to 500 and doing it overnight
5915239 this is our third installation of a new daily newspaper in 18 months it is a privilege to see a new daily being born and we at serioustec have been lucky enough to play a part in some of them lately
5915240 phnom penh post is our first installation in the cambodian market and we are delighted with the successful implementation by serioustecs team
5915241 congratulations to the phnom penh post for successfully launching their first daily edition on august 8 2008
5915242 best system to meet our needs well into the future

5915257 beyond survival how to thrive in todays business of print buying
5915258 todays print buyer must work in a media savvy advertising saturated world
5915259 the value of the print buyers forum lies in the opportunity for experienced print buyers to not only network with their peers and learn about new media applications during educational sessions but also to see firsthand how to make use of these technologies for the greatest marketing impact
5915260 from the terrific attendance at the print buyers conference at graph expo last year its clear that todays savvy print buyers need not only information about the latest technologies available to them but also for the industry to hear whats on their minds regarding new media their biggest challenges and career development
5915261 this years print buyers forum will give them the information they want and a voice im confident they will all benefit tremendously
5915262 the fact is i played on one leg for two years
5915263 you hear people say that you slowed down that you dont have it anymore but you know that you still have it all the naysayers who are saying that i lost a step theyll get a full dosage of me next year
5915264 i am however only a small shareholder besides me there are much larger shareholders adecco has to make them an attractive offer
5915265 weve updated our session tracks this year to reflect the new directions were seeing
5915266 this years conference will cover all aspects of creating great digital print applications from marketing strategy to implementation and breakthrough technology there is a vital need for thinking differently about our relationships with customers and the way we approach business our goal for the appforum this year is to help attendees make that leap
5915267 u s financial worries are responsible for about 80 percent of the market fall here today
5915268 the rest is due to the eroding outlook for corporate earnings for the first half
5915269 with the insertion of codez qr into an organizations transactional documents companies literally transform their transactional printing centers from cost centers into profit centers the qr code is the tool that makes cross media interactivity a reality for organizations by enabling recipients to move quickly and easily from the printed world to the digital world where they can engage the organization in social media interaction or pay their bill or view an invitation for additional goods or services
5915270 codez qr is transpromo it unleashes the power of recipient interactivity on a minimal amount of transpromo page real estate it provides enterprises and marketing professionals the technology they need to produce powerful multi media transaction documents

5915287 i think hes developed a bunch since the start of rookie camp
5915288 what i think that hes done well is all the sudden the games starting to slow down
5915289 when youre in preseason and youre mixing and matching lines and youre doing some of those things hes been in some tough situations and i think hes handled it pretty well hes probably made the most heads up plays at that position right now now that being said hes played the most so those things have come about a little bit more but he has made some heads up plays no different than the last play of the first half the other night
5915290 it definitely boosts your confidence i think just having him sparano seeing what im doing out there really kind of builds the confidence of my teammates around me
5915291 its only going to better myself obviously i made some mistakes out there at jacksonville but if i keep improving each and every week then hopefully i can build the confidence in him
5915292 two one im not sure where they are right now but were going to get on in this thing here
5915293 its hard to tell again chad pennington hasnt had a lot of work right now but i feel really comfortable with chad henne and with my evaluation of chad henne and where he is right now
5915294 im going to prepare myself just like im the starter each and every week so im not going to change the way i prepare or play so if i keep progressing and they dont put me in then ill just wait my turn but im just going to keep doing what im doing right now
5915295 its just production we watched him and we thought this guys done a heck of a job
5915296 obviously with the way were experimenting with roth right now we put kendall in there and kendall hasnt missed a beat i was impressed with what he did early in the game last week with his hands he had a couple pressures early on in the game
5915297 the good thing is hes playing against good people right now so hes out there starting the ballgame playing against the best people and were getting a really good evaluation of him i like him in there he might be in there for a long time
5915298 i dont look at it as pressure i look at it as my teammates depending on me
5915299 when we walk out of that tunnel were all depending on each other to make plays and go out there and watch each others back
5915300 i think donald has done enough that way and i think its donalds job to lose at that position right now
5915301 i say that in all honesty if you dont play well enough well find somebody that does and this is a marathon here were going a bunch of weeks in a row so youve got to be able to do it and youve got to be consistent but were not going to change that right now donalds a young player thats shown great progress i like what he does in there and hes continuing to get better as long as that happens i think hes going to stay there
5915302 i just need to concentrate more on my fundamentals and techniques on every single play
5915303 thats where i get in trouble sometimes when i dont use the right footsteps or proper technique jake and i feed off of each other before the games in the huddle and we talk to each other off the field we have to work together because were both brand new to everything this year
5915304 i understand another rumors flying around out there one way or the other last week it was beck this week its ronnie there was no discussion of that internally or externally none
5915305 it felt great and it was kind of a long awaited thing to be able to get back out there and run around with the guys and just kind of feel like youre back as part of the team
5915306 its just a positive being back out there running around and ill just work each day to get better doing the things that i was doing i was feeling good but once you get out there and youre covering the wide receivers its a totally different thing its still a process and each day im feeling better but that was the thing wanting to get out there weve got games coming up soon and i wanted to get back out there feel comfortable and contribute the best way possible
5915307 theyre like tackles you got to have them and if you have them you should keep them michael did some good things in the spring so hes a guy that wed love to get a chance to evaluate and see
5915308 ive been over there with mike the past week or so working out with him and hes been looking good in workouts
5915309 today he got out there and made some plays for us so its definitely good to see somebody with the experience that mike has his quickness a guy with so much upside back out on the field helping us hes one of those veteran players and probably one of the fastest guys in the secondary and a guy who also can be physical
5915310 most of the time the third preseason game is the game where its really the big big tune up for the first regular season game
5915311 that was a very important thing to really get back out there this week and just start working so i have a chance to make this team i have a chance to contribute and try to do my best to help this team in any way
5915312 nobody can really put more pressure on me than what i put on myself
5915313 i wanted to be out there the first day that we reported to camp i wanted to be out there the last mini camp of the offseason that we had its not necessarily added pressure because im sure whatever they think i think the same thing or more i wasnt really overly concerned about what sort of pressure there was or anything like that
5915314 when we brought steve in we really took a look and at this point he wasnt where we thought we needed to have him so we needed to move on
5915315 you have to look at the whole body of work no doubt about it
5915316 mental errors those kind of things they come into play
5915317 but more importantly you have to take a look at the whole body of work if a guy jumps offsides on a play whatever the case might be there i think and he has 10 other plays in the game that are pretty good plays we need to look at the plays that are pretty good plays and fix the other problems
5915318 i think its important i said that after the game i think anytime you can win at anything we do its going to be important
5915319 i mentioned this before but im sure you people compete yourself every day i like the fact that the guys wanted to win the ballgame we went out we set a goal we had a chance to win we gave ourselves a chance to win in this game and then were able to win the game its nice to see them smile after the game
5915320 we were 1 15 last year im okay with them having a little bit of fun when they do something good

5915364 hugh was the only person i have met who actually worked directly with the mayo brothers and it is my understanding that he was our last living contact with our founders
5915365 their physical presence is now locked in the annals of time and a chapter in the story of mayo is closed however the ideas the passion and the commitment for our service to patients will forever live on
5915366 i think one of the grand physicians of our time has passed on and i think from everybody at the mayo clinic the thoughts and prayers go to his family
5915367 i always thought it would be an awful way to die
5915368 now that youve discovered that vitamin k will stop the blood i know im not going to bleed to death and i wanted to thank you
5915369 he was a link between the founders their core values their hopes and dreams for the future and current leaders
5915370 he always brought a mixture of appreciation for our history with the drive for continuing the legacy into success in tomorrows world
5915371 he clearly wanted young folks like me to have a deep sense of our past and a creative sense of how to carry the vision into tomorrow he challenged my thinking during these lunches in a way that was constructive and creative

5915398 there is much fear the asaish are saying they will annex kirkuk by force and that is terrifying people
5915399 i do believe the best solution for kirkk is that it be run as a separate region after resolving all pending issues between its segments conducting a census and then letting its population determine its fate through a referendum instead of one party imposing a solution

5915409 in the first place we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an american and assimilates himself to us he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed or birthplace or origin but this is predicated upon the persons becoming in every facet an american and nothing but an american there can be no divided allegiance here any man who says he is an american but something else also isnt an american at all we have room for but one flag the american flag we have room for but one language here and that is the english language and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the american people
5915410 every immigrant who comes here should be required within five years to learn english or to leave the country

5915441 does evil exist and if it does do we ignore it do we negotiate with it do we contain it do we defeat it
5915442 evil does exist i mean i think we see evil all the time we see evil in darfur we see evil sadly on the streets of our cities it has to be confronted squarely i think it is very important for to us have some humility in how we approach the issue of confronting evil because a lot of evils been perpetrated based on the claim that we were trying to confront evil in the name of good j ust because we think that our intentions are good doesnt always mean that were going to be doing good
5915443 but i say to you do not resist one who is evil
5915444 he who is slow to anger is better than the mighty
5915445 a man of quick temper acts foolishly but a man of discretion is patient
5915446 he who is slow to anger has great understanding but he who has a hasty temper exalts folly
5915447 a hot tempered man stirs up strife but he who is slow to anger quiets contention
5915448 let every man be quick to hear slow to speak slow to anger for the anger of man does not work the righteousness of god

5915501 but over the past five years we found this huge hidden family of micrornas that we didnt know about that are now showing up in almost every area of biology
5915502 the biological equivalent of dark matter all around us but almost escaping detection
5915503 my reaction is this is why we put the genomes out there
5915504 you can see these papers taking advantage of the wealth of sequence information i find it very gratifying
5915505 its an advance for evolutionary biologists and systems biologists who are interested in how humans are wired

5915523 if the state sets our property tax rates how come we are having a vote on it
5915524 privileges are extra benefits given to a person or group they may be given only to people who meet certain conditions hunting is an example of a privilege
5915525 the increase in deer in pennsylvania is a direct result of hunting practices which have routinely killed large number of bucks thus removing a large number of animals from the herd and causing the compensatory rebound furthermore such hunting practices by constantly killing males while leaving females alive have upset the natural 1 1 female to male ratio to at least 5 females to every 1 male
5915526 in 1976 the first year for mandatory check in kentucky recored 3 476 harvested deer herd growth accelerated in the 1980s a two deer limit was begun in 1987 by 1989 the quality of the deer left much to be desired lots of deer were being killed but they were small with small racks antlers hunters blamed malnutrition disease or poor genetics but the real reason was lack of age kentucky had lots of healthy deer with good genetics but they were young the number of deer living long enough to reach their rpime was very small 22 of the bucks were two years or older less than 6 were three years old biologists determined that the quality of the deer herd would improve if more of the herd lived longer genetically superior bucks would naturally out compete their unfit rivals
5915527 hunting reduces animal populations and generates revenue it does not cost anything

5915537 we are still in the process of building up that capacity that institutional capacity within the department its a process that began with the 2006 quadrennial defense review weve clearly made progress but were not there
5915538 one of the things that the strategy talks about is the need for an expanded conception of what jointness is all about
5915539 what we need to face many of the challenges that we see now and are likely to see in the future is a jointness that encompasses not only the armed services but civilian capabilities within the defense department other departments and agencies and our friends and allies

5915554 it looked like the chain couldnt survive wal mart and was on its death march but they didnt separate toys r us and babies r us they hired some world class executives and it started to dawn on everybody that they are really going to turn around
5915555 and the toy department in wal mart is only 5 000 square feet but they have a lot of stores

5915558 he was one of many people who lived on earth at that time and he differed from other people in that he felt a desire for spirituality twenty generations after him about 3800 years ago an inhabitant of ancient mesopotamia named abraham became the next person to search for answers and to attain the spiritual world why was the presence of such special individuals in history necessary after all the rest of humanity didnt really ask about the purpose of its existence its only recently that many people have begun looking to the wisdom that those special individuals have developed the wisdom of kabbalah so why did kabbalists appear so long ago why couldnt they simply emerge today when others are more receptive to their knowledge kabbalah explains that these special spiritually developed individuals were necessary in each generation because the wisdom of kabbalah had to be revealed in different forms over time it had to be adapted to humanitys development in each period of time while most people were not aware of it those individual kabbalists

5915562 someone at the label came up with global agit pop i kind of like that
5915563 world music sounds meaningless whereas at least global is more inviting more inclusive to me after all we are playing music from all over the world really though folk music makes the most sense to me
5915564 at least those from the little mermaid and aladdin era yeah i know its not a cool thing
5915565 the more i read about it and research it i realize gee its really hard to write about
5915566 it was indeed haunted but the owner explained it was just haunted by her old pets

5915573 i was married to a guitar player big mistake there is so much to learn from fleetwood mac
5915574 so yeah married to the lead guitar player and i was in this jam band hiway freeker and also in a band called the bob dylan project
5915575 we had two different bands one where we would just cover bob dylan songs and the other which was originals and we played in new york for a couple of years then it was time to start touring and we didnt want to pay the crazy rents here so we moved back up to canada
5915576 my first two records were instrumental guitar because that was kind of a discipline just something i had been trying to accomplish
5915577 has fundamentally to do with tuning up my guitar and working from there
5915578 i always thought oh ill do another record and then ill go to grad school lt 0x2009 gt
5915579 im doing a show thats going completely back to just me on guitar what i was doing when i was touring the first time
5915580 i have lost just a little bit of my chops because i havent played guitar at that level in a while so im basically rechallenging myself to go out there for 70 or 80 minutes playing just guitar no looping no bands no cutesy chit chat it feels almost like a cleansing thing
5915581 its almost like the television show where they do an extreme makeover on a house and they only have one week to do it
5915582 i find its really a fun challenge you basically get to accomplish in one day what most musicians take 20 years to do
5915583 in my line of work its a very high stress profession and the music allows me to escape that for a bit
5915584 i love getting letters from people saying you changed my life

5915610 learning mandarin is even harder than winning eight gold medals in the pool
5915611 its the hardest thing ive ever tried in my life
5915612 after a while i could speak a little and understand a little
5915613 but all the words characters and pronounciations in mandarin are so different all of them are hard to manage
5915614 the koran and the hadees are very clear that haj is obligatory only for those who are physically mentally and financially able to undertake the pilgrimage nowhere is it said that people should take money or any other obligation from any source governmental or otherwise to perform haj i feel this haj subsidy is a political gimmick for the benefit a microscopic section of the muslim community the entire 140 million muslims in this country have to suffer the taunt of muslim appeasement so the scheme should be scrapped totally
5915615 that is how it all began but over the years i am sorry to say it has degenerated into a kickback business a few years ago a cbi officer was put in charge of investigating into charges that crores of rupees was being siphoned off under the guise of haj subsidy right from air travel to provision of accommodation and other facilities at every stage money is being made by dishonest people
5915616 retired judge once told me that people who have never entered a mosque find a place on it all kinds of people and their spouses travel free of cost are accommodated in first class hotels commute by air conditioned cars and are given a daily allowance of 150 rials per day for their 21 day stay small wonder then that they come back with tonnes and tonnes of shopping if we go back to the koran and the hadees when you perform haj at government expense that is no haj at all
5915617 perhaps i will be lynched by the community for saying so but this practice should be stopped because it goes against the very tenets and philosophy of islam
5915618 haj is the last of the five basic tenets of islam if you can afford it and find the money to perform haj without compromising any of your obligations you should go the koran and the hadees are clear that anybody who has not yet discharged all their obligations to their children or other dependants cannot and should not undertake haj nowhere is it said that if you cannot perform haj you are not a muslim
5915619 one man asked prophet mohammed that he had 12 houses so could he sell one of them and perform haj and the prophet said no you should not be economically impoverished by performing haj similarly when another man asked him if he should use his surplus money to go to haj or put it in his business to enhance it the prophet said use it for your business what the management gurus talk about today prophet mohammed declared 1 400 years ago
5915620 he said none he then explained to the shocked man that the only person whose haj would be accepted that year was of a cobbler in alexandria on his way to mecca he was accosted by a very poor man in urgent need of money and readily parted with the money meant for haj so my request to the government would be to please use the rs 150 crore on more worthwhile causes like education and health care for the poor

5915656 celtic christians had a name for the holy spirit an geadh glas or the wild goose the name hints at mystery much like a wild goose the spirit of god cannot be tracked or tamed an element of danger an air of unpredictability surround him and while the name may sound a little sacrilegious i cannot think of a better description of what its like to follow the spirit through life i think the celtic christians were on to something most of us will have no idea where we are going most of the time and i know that is unsettling but circumstantial uncertainty also goes by another name adventure

5915661 weve kept up our patrols but we havent found any kids in or around them
5915662 weve reinterviewed staff in the area and theyre now saying they believe the kids were playing in the bins and not actually residing in them
5915663 were following a number of leads to try to identify the family these kids belong to just to make sure there are no issues and so that we can confirm the kids were just playing
5915664 but certainly a closer examination of the bedding would suggest it is not children that are actually using this bin to sleep in if that is in fact what it is being used for

5915732 ninth lesson pray the lord of the harvest or prayer provides labourers solemn thought o why is it that we do not obey the injunction of the master more heartily and cry more earnestly for labourers there are two reasons for this the one is we miss the compassion of jesus which gave rise to this request for prayer when believers learn that to love their neighbor as themselves that to live entirely for gods glory in their fellow men is the fathers first commandment to his redeemed ones they will accept the perishing ones as the charge entrusted to them by their lord
5915733 and accepting them not only as a field of labour but as the objects of loving care and interest it will not be long before compassion towards the hopelessly perishing will touch their heart and the cry ascend with an earnestness till then unknown lord send labourers

5915897 it was really unusual the fish has an obvious abnormality i had never seen anything like that myself before i cant speculate on what might have caused it
5915898 it was important for the fish to be displayed at the conference to show people what we have been claiming all along
5915899 people were in disbelief here they saw a fish that we suspect is very much linked to tarsands development and contamination of the athabasca river our elders tell us that what happens to the animals and the fish is just a sign of what is going to happen to human life

5915908 the 41 year relationship between the pga tour and westchester country club was like a good marriage gone bad
5915909 i think what happened is that the tour and its tournaments evolved and what was acceptable and overlooked in the 1970s and 80s was no longer the case
5915910 every host venue has evolved or been replaced but they simply werent of the mindset to evolve you wont find another venue on tour where they play tennis off the 1st hole or play the other course when the tournaments going on i guarantee you theres not another locker room on tour shared with members

5915976 mr obama appeared to misstate his position in the cbn interview on saturday obamas campaign yesterday acknowledged that he had voted against an identical bill in the state senate
5915977 the act would effectively grant legal personhood to a pre viable fetus in direct conflict with roe in proposing this bill anti choice lawmakers are seeking to ascribe rights to fetuses at any stage of development thereby directly contradicting one of roes basic tenets
5915978 a live child born as a result of an abortion shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law
5915979 number one whenever we define a previable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or the other elements in the constitution what were really saying is in fact that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a a child a nine month old child that was delivered to term that determination then essentially if it was accepted by a court would forbid abortions to take place i mean it it would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an antiabortion statute
5915980 nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm deny expand or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive as defined in this section
5915981 obama said that had he been in the u s senate two years ago he would have voted for the born alive infants protection act even though he voted against a state version of the proposal the federal version was approved the state version was not the difference between the state and federal versions obama explained was that the state measure lacked the federal language clarifying that the act would not be used to undermine roe vs wade the 1973 u s supreme court opinion that legalized abortion
5915982 senator obama says if he had been in the u s senate in 2002 he too would have voted in favor of the born alive infant protection act because unlike the illinois bill it included language protecting roe v wade
5915983 said he had opposed the bill because it was poorly drafted and would have threatened the supreme court decision in

5915995 even with considerable practice public speaking i had remained particularly afraid of impromptu speaking the practice of relational presence has brought a wonderful sense of calm over me and the opportunity to be in the moment has been truly amazing gratifying and exhilarating
5915996 whether im at a social gathering or a work event i always remember to breathe and be in relational presence with people this dissolves my habitual feeling of being inhibited and has opened my heart along with many doors

5916007 someone somewhere cried out in pain for the same reasons mccain once did and mccain let it continue
5916008 we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex

5916210 were bored with the russians now we want them to go home
5916211 upon which side shall the democratic party fight upon the side of the idle holders of idle capital or upon the side of the struggling masses
5916212 we are an army of light and nothing shall prevail against us and in those places where the sun is darkened it will overcome
5916213 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death
5916214 lets just get one thing straight everyone knows that you are drunk theres no use in trying to act sober on a saturday night we usually get one or two people typing away on their macs a few talking over coffee with a friend maybe a family stopping in and you guys you think that you can fool these sober susans and samsons when you come stumbling around with your loud words slurred all together the jig is up you are falling out of your dress and youre smashed your cover is blowwwwnn

5916217 sept 7 i dont know what that is that the first day of the season i keep telling you guys that this is camp this is every day this is my job to get ready for thursday if i let myself get caught up in stuff that i cant control like who plays sept 7 im really letting my performance be affected on thursday
5916218 all were doing is keeping the same process weve been doing
5916219 youre asking the wrong person dont know not sure theres three of us reps are hard to come by right now its difficult
5916220 ive had my reps out here and im just trying to take advantage of them not sure what theyre thinking or whats going on upstairs
5916221 this decision is going to be based on who we feel at this point gives us the best chance to win
5916222 theres a difference between premature optimisation and doing things right in the first place
5916223 maybe if i use direct field access instead of a getter it will be quicker
5916224 iterate over arrays backwards because the comparison with zero is cheaper
5916225 so stated a former colleague of mine in one of his less profane moments
5916226 we wouldnt need to f g optimise this s t if they did it right in the first f g place
5916227 like animals vicious seductive they say no human male can resist them

5916229 let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do
5916230 programming is best regarded as the process of creating works of literature which are meant to be read
5916231 im creating a utility for a math teacher to check and make sure that the students answered his random questions correctly
5916232 i have never seen a block of code written by me or by the coders that came before me that needed a why
5916233 p s double here means it can hold a floating point number
5916234 generally you want your comments to tell what your code does not how
5916235 explain how it works and what you are doing so someone else can come in and follow your train of thought
5916236 there is absolutely no need to learn all about square root algorithms to fix errors in this code
5916237 i have absolutely no idea what square root algorithms there are out there nor do i care nor should i care
5916238 in fact if i were to come across such a situation id probably just throw the library away and go with something else
5916239 i work in the real world i have a job to do and i dont have time to fuck around
5916240 i am a better programmer coder developer etc than you because i think this way
5916241 this is the olympics there isnt room for im not sure if you have doubt get out

5916243 my bags got lost again it was a bit of a worry because i have a outfit to wear but luckily they arrived today
5916244 i settled into the chair and miss green stabbed me in the arm
5916245 when i say stabbed i mean freddie cougar has nothing on greenie
5916246 after the first stab she quickly realised she didnt get enough out of the war wound she had created and zoned in on my left arm
5916247 at that moment just as she was about to slash my left arm javier gomez one of his triathlon rivals walks into the room

5916264 ethanol must undergo rapid evolution for global application and proliferation food based ethanol is clearly not a viable alternative and there is already a chorus of vocal dissent across all population spectrums because of the obvious conflict next generation ethanol cellulosic and waste based has the potential to see widespread acceptance infrastructure readiness costs for higher ethanol content fuels remain a sizable hurdle provision of next generation low ethanol content fuel utilizing the current distribution infrastructure is feasible and holds promise

5916275 if they cannot agree on the restoration of the judges in a matter of days then clearly something is not right with the coalition
5916276 we cannot afford to lose months or even weeks on these political issues they need to get to the economy and only a strong government can take the tough decisions needed for the economy
5916277 we have been assigned to reach a consensus on the situation within the next 72 hours
5916278 he resigned himself and as far as his accountability is concerned coalition partners will decide
5916279 we are deeply saddened that leroi moore saxophonist and founding member of dave matthews band died unexpectedly tuesday afternoon august 19 2008 at hollywood presbyterian medical center in los angeles from sudden complications stemming from his june atv accident on his farm near charlottesville virginia leroi had recently returned to his los angeles home to begin an intensive physical rehabilitation program
5916280 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5916281 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
5916282 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
5916283 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
5916284 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
5916285 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
5916286 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future
5916287 we see him on the news but we dont pay much attention to him
5916288 i personally believe these price levels are acceptable for jewellery makers and private investors buying on the etf from now on actual demand will recover
5916289 theres no doubt that there should be criminal charges because from the very beginning to the end all of the parents were purposely lied to
5916290 we were promised that three tour guides or camp counselors would be taking care of the children plus there would be medical care as well
5916291 this woman knew from the beginning that she wouldnt be able to provide it

5916296 the point simply is that you had a certain set of wrong policies which culminated into a situation where the whole movement which started for a separate status in 1950 its journey has been towards separatism but i think even today any country worth its salt is going to allow its territory to be compromised with and india shall not under any circumstances compromise with its territory
5916297 generally its a pretty unfriendly environment for anything thats not a treasury note
5916298 but in terms of the ultimate credit worthiness of agencies and their ability and willingness to pay off on all their debt obligations that position is stronger now than it was a year ago
5916299 the big story right now is to what extent will the asians continue to support the gse debt
5916300 if the asians dont play who are we going to get as a replacement

5916302 this announcement extends our commitment to blending ultraportability and functionality and equipping todays business users with the most advanced highest performing computing tools
5916303 there have been debates and disputes about who has the right to represent the kashmiri people but i think today the people have represented themselves india needs azadi freedom from kashmir as much as kashmir needs azadi from india
5916304 countries are not run by writers who can write in the flow of the movement those who have no stake in running the system are free to express their views in a democratic society but certainly their views are not going to be acceptable to a large part of india
5916305 the reconciliatory process started by atal behari vajpayee continued till 2005 but suddenly after the transfer of power everything came to a standstill you pushed the people of kashmir to a wall with this economic blockade by bjp you have totally alienated the people of kashmir
5916306 whatever mehbooba ji is saying they never did when it was their turn now since they are not in power they are blaming others thsi is being opportunist
5916307 all of us right here in north carolina and all across the country can stand up and say we are going to seek a better future we are going to seek a fair future we are going to rebuild this economy we are going to put people back to work were going to stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas we are going to make sure that everybody has opportunity in america
5916308 if two people are just out walking around in a group making their presence known that people are out and looking and watching out for trouble i think that in itself would be a big help

5916310 we deeply regret this incident and apologize for the concern and inconvenience it has caused
5916311 we are committed to helping those who were affected and strongly encourage them to sign up for the complimentary credit monitoring and to take the action steps outlined in our letter
5916312 this is not sportscenter this is much more outside the lines
5916313 its very much about a series of conversations about management first and how it applies to the business of sports and how it fits into society
5916314 one does not become a gm of a major league team simply by going to school and learning stuff in a classroom
5916315 the nature of our industry requires not only book smarts but street smarts
5916316 we have the advantage of being close to indianapolis there are the pacers colts u s a swimming and gymnastics
5916317 its important to understand what the program is designed to do and how much flexibility the degree offers
5916318 a caution i throw out for undergraduates is that they spend four years with a degree with the word sports in it and 10 years later they dont want to do sports anymore that degree wont be as flexible
5916319 five years ago many thought if they got a degree in sport management that was their ticket to work in professional sports in the four major sports leagues football baseball basketball hockey
5916320 but now they realize that those jobs are few and far between and the turnover is small
5916321 i just walked right on past him to the bedroom and got my gun

5916331 he had a conversation with my mom and i came back outside and saw my brother get in a truck with lee evans a green pick up truck and drive off
5916332 even one of them alive having made contact in some fashion or form even through a third person hasnt happened
5916333 something happened to them and 30 years later we know its not good else we would know something
5916334 the five black youths never entered the public consciousness the way some white middle class missing children do
5916335 the amount of knowledge from dmi far exceeds what i paid
5916336 well ok already two hours there we well leave now see you in 2 months
5916337 hes not going to get to the byline any more but his free kicks are still very good
5916338 bentley is a similar player but has energy and will probably score more goals than beckham he is someone who well be looking at for the long term and im sure he will get his opportunity but if hes going to be picked he needs a run in the side
5916339 i think he needs to know that hes going to play three or four games and then well see him relax hes a young player who has come into the squad and is fighting for a spot but i believe he has tried too hard
5916340 as soon as we lost ryan giggs to a hamstring injury and michael carrick with an ankle we lost a bit of our experience in midfield we had possession of the ball but didnt make it count at times but in light of the people we had missing it was a creditable result for us
5916341 portsmouth didnt think we would play like we did and we were more aggressive than last season i think they were surprised by our team i only give the players the freedom to play and allow them to express their style
5916342 this is what i was taught my father taught me and my brother that you never hurt a woman no matter what she does you cant do anything back and this is just the way it was and my sisters took full advantage believe me they did all kinds of stuff to my brother and i but we could never do anything back to them

5916351 technology has gotten so advanced for him to do something like that maybe he just wanted to see what it would do
5916352 its very disturbing because our children are playing outside all the time
5916353 he was putting some type of dark liquid in there and then from a distance he was throwing rocks or stones at it and was trying to see if something happens

5916366 in the uk alone two million people have diabetes and up to 750 000 are believed to be carriers of the condition without even realising
5916367 these are worrying statistics but by diagnosing the disease in patients early on a number of measures can be put in place to minimise any related health issues findings from this research could really help with early diagnosis if opticians were equipped with the knowledge and technology to spot health concerns which could indicate the first signs of diabetes the uks early diagnosis rate could be improved significantly
5916368 it was a beautiful model but there were parts of it that didnt add up and those parts directly conflicted with the model published in 2001
5916369 this suggests that the steric occlusion model best explains the available biochemical and structural evidence that has been published
5916370 any evidence positive or negative will help focus our attention toward this goal

5916404 the weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths
5916405 in essence the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch
5916406 ranging from changes characteristic of the primary viral pneumonia and evidence of tissue repair to evidence of severe acute secondary bacterial pneumonia
5916407 clearly and consistently implicated secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory flora in most influenza fatalities
5916408 we are encouraged by the fact that pandemic planners are already considering and implementing some of these actions says dr fauci
5916409 limitations in the supply of blood can have potentially life threatening consequences for patients with massive blood loss
5916410 embryonic stem cells represent a new source of cells that can be propagated and expanded indefinitely providing a potentially inexhaustible source of red blood cells for human therapy
5916411 we show that up to 65 of the blood cells underwent multiple maturation events that resulted in the extrusion of the nucleus
5916412 they formed enucleated erythrocytes with a diameter of 6 8 which is similar to normal red blood cells we also showed that the cells could express adult globin and respond normally to biochemical changes
5916413 although more work is required before this can move into the clinic we are pleased with the rapid progress that is being made by our scientists and others we are optimistic about the potential future role for stem cells as a donorless source of blood for transfusion
5916414 few interventions have been proved to substantially help patients with chronic back pain in the longer term
5916415 lessons in the alexander technique offer an individualised approach to develop skills that help people recognise understand and avoid poor habits affecting postural tone and neuromuscular coordination the practice and theory of the technique support the hypothesis that it could potentially reduce back pain by limiting muscle spasm strengthening postural muscles improving coordination and flexibility and decompressing the spine

5916442 this is a clear violation of the fundamental rights of individuals to live and practice their faith
5916443 forcing doctors to have to choose between being a doctor and being a christian in the state of california is an outrageous violation of the fundamental rights of every american to be able to practice their faith and not to have to leave their occupation because of it
5916444 this is instead about the thought police attempting to censor christian beliefs and christian perspectives that dont agree with homosexuality were talking about individuals being able to force doctors or other professionals to violate their faith in order to keep their job
5916445 for example lawyers who are engaging in marriage and family law can now be forced to execute documents for homosexuals adopting children
5916446 and individual with a wedding service despite their christian faith to the contrary can now be forced to conduct wedding services and wedding preparations for lesbian or homosexual male couples
5916447 this just goes to show how critically important it is for us in the united states to have a supreme court that is not against those who practice the christian faith but instead understands what the constitution is about and do not engage in outrageous judicial activism
5916448 we have never seen a gap between the leader and the rest of the pack this big if we are correct in that it has something to do with the launch of vista the other guys will of course correct that and come back a little bit
5916449 i believe this notion of understanding user intent being able to analyze search queries and come up with search patterns and use them to shape the search experience is one of the most important areas for us

5916452 we think that tech natural language processing is going to be a very critical way for us to improve relevance further at scale

5916455 we think that will bring next level of efficiency to the search marketplace were very bullish about that

5916494 today more than three quarters of those radio airwaves or white space spectrum are completely unused this vast public resource could offer a revolution in wireless services of all kinds including universal wireless internet
5916495 we are worried the fcc will buckle and allow white space to be used by personal portable devices seeking wireless services
5916496 the radio frequency environment is going to become more crowded and more difficult to use
5916497 in that case the number of wireless microphones used will be reduced significantly and it cost big productions millions of dollars to redesign what they do
5916498 everybody is not only angry and upset they are very very worried
5916499 from the beginning we have said that no white space device should come to market unless the fcc signs off on it
5916500 we have a limited amount of engineering resources and there are hard costs such as fcc licenses that we have had to get
5916501 it may be typical of the pro obama dungeons amp dragons crowd to disparage a fellow countrymans memory of war from the comfort of moms basement

5916540 it stratford is literally on my doorstep and 15 minutes away from where my parents live and where i was brought up and lived all my life
5916541 that would be quite something to come out on the track and compete in front of my home fans cathy freeman all over again
5916542 i am a fighter and will always fight to the end this is something i have learnt from my childhood and it has only got stronger as i have grown older
5916543 my parents instilled pretty strong values in all of us and i have retained them

5916545 we will have to repatriate him back to vietnam because he is on our watch list as persona non grata thai immigration cannot let him enter
5916546 we need to control him and he will be controlled once he returns to this country
5916547 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5916548 we have a lot of schools that have a lot of problems

5916551 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5916552 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5916553 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5916554 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5916555 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5916556 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5916557 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5916558 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5916559 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5916560 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5916561 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5916562 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5916563 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5916564 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5916565 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5916566 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5916567 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5916568 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5916569 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

5916571 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5916572 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5916573 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5916574 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5916575 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5916576 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5916577 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5916578 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5916579 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5916580 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5916581 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5916582 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5916583 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5916584 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5916585 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5916586 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5916587 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5916588 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5916589 as a result despite difficult conditions across the global automotive industry leather generated a second year of strong earnings growth
5916590 the division achieved that growth despite the ongoing appreciation of the australian dollar against the us dollar and the euro during the 2008 financial year
5916591 more recently the australian dollar has declined against both other currencies which if sustained should positively impact the divisions earnings going forward
5916592 trading conditions remain challenging in many industries serviced by sfc and the impact of the ongoing global credit crisis on the group is difficult to assess
5916593 potential exists for each of the australian construction and property markets and the global automotive industries to be adversely affected
5916594 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5916595 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5916596 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5916597 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5916598 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5916599 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5916600 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5916601 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5916602 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5916603 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5916604 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5916605 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5916606 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5916607 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5916608 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
5916609 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
5916610 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
5916611 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
5916612 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
5916613 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
5916614 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
5916615 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
5916616 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
5916617 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
5916618 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5916619 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5916620 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5916621 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5916622 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5916623 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5916624 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5916625 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5916626 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
5916627 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
5916628 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
5916629 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans

5916636 we dont want to be in a situation where we are in some kind of frozen relationship
5916637 but until russia pulls its forces out of georgia and respects international norms of the 21st century we just cant go on with business as usual
5916638 if these decisions are in fact taken on behalf of the georgian aggressor we will not be able to maintain the quality and the schedule of our relationship with nato
5916639 we have a serious temptation to bring all our potential cooperation with nato under question
5916640 when im president there will be a whole lot more like this not only here in the gulf but also off of our east and west coasts
5916641 we need to drill offshore we need to do it now
5916642 the reality is that senator mccain can visit oil rigs and do photo ops all he wants but it is pretty clear from the policies hes advocating that hes literally over the barrel when it comes to the oil industry
5916643 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5916644 i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain
5916645 behind all of these claims and positions by sen obama lies the ambition to be president
5916646 we should not keep spending 10 billion a month in iraq while americans struggle in a sluggish economy
5916647 i played my entire childhood away i was always practising and doing concerts
5916648 i think the defining moment i knew id continue was in my late teens after i had stopped and realized how much i missed it
5916649 even though im from here theres still a lot of people who dont know my music obviously im not reaching broad enough audiences
5916650 my goal is to broaden the definition of east coast music there is some good country music here as well as your typical east coast music
5916651 im going into uncharted territory and ill find my way with the audiences support if the community doesnt support local musicians we dont make it to the next step
5916652 natsuyaki san why is it that most of the hello pro members called you little fujimoto

5916660 i was i mean i am not corrupting anyones mind right guys
5916661 the door has been opened i want to work hard and prove im not just a token woman or figurehead

5916687 his experience is his hole card youre going to have to find a way to beat him because he wont beat himself he has the ability to keep you in a game he knows what hes doing to me he adds more than just taking the ball every five or six days
5916688 great the guys got a lot to offer a hall of famer
5916689 hes a lot smarter than a lot of people smarter than anyone ive ever played with as far as setting up hitters is concerned

5916723 im going to be watching you every step off the way miki and not just me im going to have everyone on your back and youre not gonna know whats hit you ive dealt with plenty of others like you in her before and theyve all been stronger smarter and hell even better looking than you are so before you go acting clever dont cause youre only gonna end up looking stupid or with any luck dead
5916724 all those other girls are only just getting to the last lap a bit worrying dont you think
5916725 yes indeed such a clear difference in fitness levels is definitely something to worry about
5916726 well these girls are clearly well above the usual fitness levels for these women and so well have to find out why that is
5916727 then its settled a nice thorough cavity search for both these ladies and i feel that its my duty to do it
5916728 oh come on miki no need to treat me like a little kid im just making sure everythings alright you know the last thing i want is you doing something silly that gets someone hurt especially not you
5916729 all those other girls are only just getting to the last lap a bit worrying dont you think
5916730 yes indeed such a clear difference in fitness levels is definitely something to worry about
5916731 this is all about money this is about money from the state treasury
5916732 we are still slightly over our projected estimates however the bids came in lower than the first time around
5916733 obviously were pleased we were able to get some economies by rebidding the project but some challenges remain we are still optimistic we can raise sufficient funds to make the project a reality
5916734 we will have to repatriate him back to vietnam because he is on our watch list as persona non grata thai immigration cannot let him enter
5916735 you cant make me ive done my time im a free man
5916736 if it wasnt profitable i wouldnt be able to stand here
5916737 it was something that we were looking to expand upon and it really fit in with the mission
5916738 agriculture has been long been an integral component of the districts economy and the chairman and i have worked hard for local farmers
5916739 it was an honor to bring the chairman to the district to reach out to constituents answer their questions and hear from them how to best keep ohios agriculture economy strong
5916740 ive picked up information that we need to check out about the farm bill
5916741 we need to change the mindset that got us into iraq
5916742 i think ohio is absolutely essential to winning the presidency
5916743 i think who wins ohio will be our next president in my judgment it is impossible to overstate the importance of ohio in determining who is going to lead this country in the future
5916744 we havent been able to get any firm dates or places put on the calendar yet but we do know that the senator will be spending quite a bit of time in ohio
5916745 wed like to go into these communities to spend time with people and let them know how important the votes in these rural areas and small towns are to the ultimate outcome of the election
5916746 i spent quite a bit of time with him on a bus so we had opportunities to talk extensively
5916747 i told him about what problems people are facing i am confident that sen obama will be the kind of president that understands the needs of appalachia and will pursue policies that would be helpful
5916748 hes supporting a health care plan that would save the average family about 2 500 in health care costs while making affordable insurance available to practically all americans
5916749 hes laid out ways to pay for this its not a pie in the sky promise hes determined that we can do it and with the resources we already have hes also proposing a 1 000 tax credit for students to help them afford college
5916750 i believe what were experiencing in our economy now is different than the regular cycles of ebb and flow for a variety of reasons
5916751 first is globalization second is the explosion of costs of petroleum based products these are challenges that are difficult but ones that also present incredible opportunities we can use these challenges in our economy especially related to energy to create new industries and new jobs ohio can and i believe will be able to use its historic ability to make and manufacture things to lead the way in many of these new industries if we make the right decisions we can create a more positive and more progressive future
5916752 i stressed to sen obama that our infrastructure is crumbling
5916753 i emphasized rebuilding america we talked about that for quite some time i hope we hear something about that in sen obamas acceptance speech if we do ill feel really good
5916754 wed love to have the gold medal but if we lose were going home with the silver
5916755 this just means that we did what we set out to do
5916756 we still have one more match remaining which would be the crowning achievement for probably our careers its fantastic to get there but the final goal is to get the gold medal if we dont get that we still have had a great time but ill be disappointed
5916757 wed love to have the gold medal but if we lose were going home with the silver
5916758 this just means that we did what we set out to do
5916759 we still have one more match remaining which would be the crowning achievement for probably our careers its fantastic to get there but the final goal is to get the gold medal if we dont get that we still have had a great time but ill be disappointed

5916779 the uk has a rigorous system in place for managing child sex offenders which is among the toughest in the world

5916822 i think it would be prudent to extend his contract before the start of the season thats all im dealing with right now
5916823 where the team is going short term and long term
5916824 its easy to say what could you have done but i think he would have been let down if he had known i traded mikko koivu i dont think he was let down as he is trying to understand clearly what were trying to do
5916825 i think its pretty obvious itll be koivu and sheppard will replace koivu in the role that koivu had
5916826 and if youre frightened you can be frightened you can be thats ok
5916827 i dont think were ever going to be able to put the suspicions to bed

5916829 opening is a welcome development for us especially since we have outgrown both the domestic passenger terminal and naia 1 as the countrys fastest growing airline we are very pleased to be offering our passengers a much improved airport facility
5916830 now that we will be flying both domestic and international services under one roof we will be able to see some operational efficiencies and offer our passengers an even better product
5916831 the decision to take this plea was not based on our belief that he was guilty of manslaughter the decision to take this case was based on a calculation of potential times to be served given potential outcomes of this case
5916832 thats assuming that he is going to be allowed to withdraw his no contest plea and you have to have a valid reason to do that under the law
5916833 there was a urine sample that he provided to the hospital and then for legal reasons it wasnt used and that will come out if there is a trial but it didnt matter if it wasnt used they keep him there and get another one

5916842 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
5916843 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
5916844 since summer weve been having community people come and talk to us about when is it gonna start and so were so excited
5916845 its always right about two between two and two thirty kinda dodging traffic trying to get across the street and our kids dont go in packs they kinda go one by one so the cars are really scary for some of our kids
5916846 we have issues with cars lining up at the area trying to get out ross over and also kids flowing into the area so its been a problem for a while
5916847 i have to go through that traffic about 7 45 every morning so itll help me a little bit
5916848 a lot of seniors are also using these areas here people found these to be very very dangerous
5916849 it produces about a half to a third of what our demand is in terms of kilowatt hours
5916850 often times the kumu kit doesnt completely eliminate a homes electric bill but its a great place to start and its financially feasible
5916851 thats one of the downsides is the upfront cost this particular system the upfront cost with tax is about 14 400 but one of the positives is that the tax credits off set that cost down to about half
5916852 i think its worth it the positives far outweigh the few negatives there are
5916853 so its a way that we can reduce our carbon footprint reduce our dependency on oil

5916857 because of the way that light rail operates with the pepsi station closure and then down to denver union station they simply did not want any passengers aboard light rail going immediately past the pepsi center for security purposes
5916858 for our light rail service the c and e lines will not go all the way to denver union station so people will need to de board
5916859 actually weve been pleasantly surprised looking at the detours that will effect our normal routes
5916860 because the hov lanes are going to be open northbound so many of our routes coming from downtown do use those hov lanes so that is a huge step forward for us
5916861 the main thing is people will get to their destination it may be kind of by a circuitous route

5916864 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5916865 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5916866 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo

5916868 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie

5916870 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible

5916873 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5916874 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5916875 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5916876 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5916877 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5916878 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5916879 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5916880 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5916881 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5916882 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5916883 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5916884 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5916885 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5916886 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5916887 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5916888 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5916889 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5916890 every individual must have the possibility of practising sport without discrimination of any kind and in the olympic spirit
5916891 its not as if there are no women from majority muslim countries competing in the beijing games
5916892 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5916893 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5916894 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5916895 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5916896 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5916897 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5916898 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5916899 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5916900 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5916901 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5916902 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5916903 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
5916904 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
5916905 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
5916906 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
5916907 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
5916908 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
5916909 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
5916910 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
5916911 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
5916912 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
5916913 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
5916914 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
5916915 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
5916916 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
5916917 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
5916918 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer

5916921 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
5916922 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
5916923 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5916924 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5916925 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5916926 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5916927 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad

5916929 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5916930 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5916931 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5916932 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5916933 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5916934 local government eduation and public access but yes when pressed its all about bedford
5916935 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
5916936 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
5916937 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
5916938 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
5916939 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5916940 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5916941 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5916942 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5916943 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5916944 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5916945 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5916946 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5916947 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5916948 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5916949 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5916950 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5916951 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5916952 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena

5917071 gwyneth paltrow wont be the apple of her daughters eye if she continues to flaunt fur
5917072 its a terrible example to set for a young child promoting an industry that electrocutes animals snaps their necks and skins them alive
5917073 there is nothing feminine about inserting an electrode into the anus of a terrified and struggling fox and then electrocuting it ms paltrow is an actress and seemingly a particularly stupid one at that

5917101 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5917102 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5917103 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5917104 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5917105 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5917106 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5917107 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5917108 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5917109 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5917110 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5917111 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5917112 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5917113 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5917114 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5917115 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5917116 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5917117 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5917118 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5917119 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5917120 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5917121 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5917122 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5917123 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5917124 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5917125 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5917126 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5917127 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5917128 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5917129 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion

5917131 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5917132 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one

5917134 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5917135 we had a board majority with people who had one main goal to disband the association

5917138 muxtape will be unavailable for a brief period while we sort out a problem with the riaa

5917145 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5917146 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5917147 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5917148 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5917149 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5917150 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5917151 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5917152 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5917153 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5917154 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5917155 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5917156 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5917157 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5917158 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5917159 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5917160 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5917161 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5917162 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5917163 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5917164 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5917165 you guys have better things to do im not the guy
5917166 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items

5917172 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5917173 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5917174 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5917175 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5917176 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5917177 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5917178 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5917179 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally

5917200 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5917201 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5917202 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5917203 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5917204 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that

5917236 antes la cremaci n era criticada pero ya es una pr ctica aceptada por muchos grupos el lenguaje y la tradici n en torno a la muerte va cambiando dependiendo de las circunstancias

5917243 no party has got a monopoly on vice or virtue no partys got a monopoly on faith but im not going to let the democrats be painted as sort of the anti faith party because its just flat wrong

5917375 i do believe the best solution for kirkk is that it be run as a separate region after resolving all pending issues between its segments conducting a census and then letting its population determine its fate through a referendum instead of one party imposing a solution

5917427 reports that u s and iraqi government jails hold nearly 100 000 prisoners most of them languishing there without trial and proof of wrong doing are appalling most arrests in iraq whether by u s or iraqi troops are arbitrary carried out with little or no evidence the u s was most vociferous in its condemnation of the former regime for its arbitrary and summary arrests and inhuman conditions of its prisons but for many iraqis this so called beacon of democracy has even surpassed saddam hussein in human rights violations u s troops can do almost everything with impunity in iraq they have the right to seize any one in the country merely on suspicion of terror which no authority in the world can define what it really means and to provide enough room for its iraqi suspects the u s has built numerous prisons in the country perhaps its only post war reconstruction feat

5917439 prolific scholar and outstanding teacher in a later legal settlement finkelstein
5917440 finkelsteins work on the holocaust is not regarded highly by other scholars in the field
5917441 we believe our administration should be following its own stated mission and only invite speakers who meet our high level of scholarship and who exercise academic responsibility
5917442 americas leading anti semite grand wizard of the kkk leader of hitler youth david duke in the minds of many norman finkelstein has become hitchcocks norman bates hysteria and outright manipulation distort his record and thereby divert discussion from his ideas to the bogey that people imagine people have written me that inviting a speaker like norman finkelstein is like throwing a bomb in a darkened theater it is like exposing the vulnerable young to inexorable evil i do not think so a university should be a well lit place where intelligent people interrogate each other sharply but civilly such conduct is its own protection our only protection really against evil have we reached the point where we fear ideas as for yelling fire suddenly surely we all knew in advance that the speaker was coming as for trapping people in a theater who has been forced to stay as for the dark well dialogue is enlightenment so i turn the question back to you sitting here are you the flash in the night if our inability to manage lectures and discussions about controversial issues forces us to leave them to the battling hacks on talk radio and the networks then the university indeed will become a dark theater occupied by know nothings who receive their conclusions pre thought and pre packaged from elsewhere we will then concentrate on the ice capades of the intellect the unthreatening but elegant analysis of what we already agree to as objective and the airing of voices that sound like us and say what we would say we will be the poorer for that though i am sure much more self righteously content here is a chance to show that we are better than that
5917443 you have to understand its a deeply offensive statement to say that i deny the suffering that my parents endured
5917444 i understand that norman finkelstein is being considered for a position as a university wide visiting scholar at csun and am writing in that connection in brief i think it would be an outstanding appointment at any university as one indication of my own evaluation i published a very favorable review of his image and reality in the israel palestine conflict and recommended it as one of the three best books of the year on political and international affairs in a year end survey of opinion by the london guardian in general his work is recognized to be outstanding in the range of disciplines in which he has published there is no doubt in my mind that finkelstein is a person of great intelligence and insight as well as unusual integrity and that his work is of remarkably high quality in addition to his books finkelstein has produced a series of fine critical and analytic essays on developments in the middle east on political theory and more recently on international law including reviews of studies by scholars and of court decisions and important contributions of his own on the politics of the middle east and international affairs more generally his work is invariably conducted with scrupulous documentation careful research and thoughtful and judicious evaluation and analysis that he will have outstanding success in teaching and direction of research i have no doubt he is unusually well qualified for the position of visiting scholar it would be a very strong appointment in my judgment
5917445 i have read every book that professor finkelstein published and i attended the lectures he delivered at csun and also the lectures he delivered this past year at ucla to describe professor finkelstein as a towering intellectual figure masterful brilliant meticulously methodical precise eloquent and exceedingly gracious and polite does not begin to describe him as a writer and lecturer professor finkelsteins entire categorical paradigm is that he honors the memory of the holocaust to such an extent that he rejects any effort to politicize or to opportunistically capitalize on its painful memory indeed he is explicitly critical of any effort to deny human suffering or to in any way render human suffering subservient or secondary to any functional political considerations it is no surprise that professor finkelsteins list of admirers constitutes a virtual hall of scholarly fame he is very highly regarded not just by the most accomplished intellectuals in the united states but around the world i cannot possibly emphasize the extent to which the fact that professor finkelstein is not occupying a post in an academic institution in the united states is a national embarrassment and is a fundamental and quintessential breakdown of our scholastic ideals professor finkelsteins presence will not just accrue to the substantial benefit of csun but will also deeply enrich the intellectual environment of southern california and all its schools
5917446 i write in support of this remarkable scholar and intellectual who is a committed believer in what the university represents and to judge by his teaching record is an exceptional teacher his vilification in recent months for spurious reasons that have nothing to do with the quality of his work has served to expose the grave limits of academic freedom in the united states particularly where the study of the middle east is concerned prof finkelstein is an internationally recognized scholar who has won exceptional acclaim for studies he has published on crucial aspects of modern european as well as middle eastern history i refer to his studies of the holocaust and israeli policy in the context of the israel palestine conflict his work in these areas has been marked by a critical level of erudition a scrupulous documentation and a persistent moral integrity in exposing the exploitation of the holocaust and in documenting the origins of israels policies toward the palestinians before during and after the creation of the state he has addressed questions of history memory and responsibility and above all of justice the results form an essential body of knowledge for those seeking to understand the origins and persistence of the israel palestine conflict a subject of overwhelming importance in the united states and indeed in the world today
5917447 i like norman am a child of holocaust survivors engaged in research on the palestinian israeli conflict because of our shared background i feel that i can speak about him from a position others cannot normans scholarship is exceptional both for its brilliance and rigor in the fields of middle eastern studies and political science his work is considered seminal and there is no doubt that both disciplines would be intellectually weaker without it normans power and value however do not emanate only from his scholarship but from his character his lifes work shaped largely but not entirely by his experience as a child of survivors has been and continues to be informed by a profound concern with human dignity and the danger of dehumanization unlike many in the academy including some of his most vociferous detractors norman has always remained faithful to his principles even when such consistency demanded great personal and professional sacrifice
5917448 dr finkelsteins work straddles political theory the israel palestine conflict and american policy towards the middle east his work in this field is immensely thorough original and penetrating there are many scholars in the united states working on this area but dr finkelstein stands out as one of the most able most erudite and most critical his articles all display a number of admirable qualities intellectual vigour intellectual integrity a capacity to get to the heart of the matter and a tendency to subject the conventional wisdom to searching scrutiny i recommend him very strongly and without any reservations for a tenured position in any american university
5917449 norman finkelstein has undoubtedly been one of the most provocative thinkers on these sensitive subjects and he challenges all of us to raise the quality of our work even when i have had a different point of view he has pushed me to be a better intellectual by his relentless pursuit of logic reason and evidence as research director of a major program at harvard law school i am well aware that norman finkelstein has generated hostility from one of hlss most famous faculty members the felix frankfurter professor of law alan dershowitz and yet i can testify that norman finkelstein conducted himself with great dignity the various times he has spoken at harvard he always allows his opponents plenty of opportunity to criticize him finkelsteins works have been translated into many languages around the world i have received my share of communications from overseas scholars who have expressed disappointment with u s universities for timidity when it comes to welcoming such a major voice of intellectual engagement and dissent
5917450 if you wish to discuss this decision you are free to speak with the provost helumt p epp
5917451 in a 2002 speech in boston tutu made some comments that were especially hurtful
5917452 while archbishop tutu is not a friend of israel we do not believe he is an anti semite as you rightly point out in your letter his words have often stung the jewish community however while he may at times have crossed the line we believe that he should have been permitted to speak on your campus
5917453 harvards department of english invited tom paulin oxford professor and one of the finest living british poets to speak but promptly disinvited him after then university president lawrence h summers expressed disapproval of paulins criticisms of israel though the department later voted to reverse the disinvitation paulin has never come to campus
5917454 also according to trivers jeffrey epstein later admitted ordering the cancellation and said that he had done so under pressure from dershowitz epstein a legal client of dershowitz had donated the funds used to establish the program for evolutionary dynamics which according to other sources depends for its future effectiveness on further funding from him
5917455 facts on the ground archaeological practice and territorial self fashioning in israeli society
5917456 looked at the role of archeology in what was essentially a political project the biblical validation for jewish claims in what is now israel
5917457 in the 1980s i was invited to a major us university for a week of lectures on philosophy and of course added many other talks and meetings in those days mostly on central america a tenured professor who taught part time at tel aviv invited me to give a talk on the middle east the next day i got a call from campus police asking if i would agree to have uniformed police with me the entire time i was on campus i refused but was accompanied by undercover armed police the whole time walking from the faculty club to a phil seminar for example after i left there was a huge campaign of vilification and an effort to remove tenure from the prof who invited me
5917458 academic freedom is revered at usf we respect the right of faculty to express their personal views on controversial subjects with the understanding that it must be clear they are speaking for themselves and not for the university in this case i have recognized my great responsibility to fully consider both the welfare of the university community and dr rights of expression

5917493 people have always been fascinated by how some trees such as douglas fir or redwoods can grow so tall
5917494 this is not an easy thing to do think about trying to drink water through a narrow 350 foot long straw it takes a lot of suction
5917495 higher and higher in the tree the valves change so they are able to withstand more pulling force from the long heavy column of water before air bubbles can be sucked through
5917496 but the problem is that the valves become less efficient at letting water pass the height at which no water would pass at all according to our models coincides with the tallest records for douglas fir about 350 to 400 feet
5917497 as you go higher and higher in a douglas fir tree its almost like experiencing a drought
5917498 and thats what we see at the tops of very tall trees the foliage is struggling to get enough water and seems to be under drought stress its not unusual to see periodic die back at the tops of very tall douglas fir trees that are near their height limits

5917507 although its not something jamie lynn is discussing we all have our doubts that their relationship is solid definitely if not for two month old daughter maddie jamie lynn would have had enough of the stress of this relationship by now
5917508 we all really do hope this relationship can turn out well that it can be the fairy tale jamie lynn wants well have to see

5917510 izzies got a love story and its a big one one that ive been kicking around in my head for a bit one that required me to take a huge leap of faith in myself one that is so secret that i have not told anyone not the writers not anyone
5917511 the pm told me that his party did not take any decision on the pla as reported in the media
5917512 until a new decision the pms security would be managed as per the decision of the former government
5917513 its unfortunate that the pm suspects the national army and the security bodies
5917514 its a conspiracy to insult and demoralise the national security mechanism nc condemns such activities and demands an end to dual security system which is not in practice anywhere in the world
5917515 the pm has ordered nrs 2 crore nepali rs20m to be released from the pms relief fund for the flood victims
5917516 he has also ordered medical teams to rush to the area
5917517 nepal has lost millions due to the delay by the indian side in opening the sluice gates
5917518 theyve taken this opportunity to fleece the general public and the fallout has been quite spectacular
5917519 this has been a cold calculated rip off of the general public
5917520 i got down to hylands house to an entrance to find about 30 people also waiting for richard and waited still trying to get through
5917521 eventually at 1930 approx the phone was the switched off
5917522 on arrival at the venue jays phone was switched off and could not be contacted so i paid an extra 10 to park so i could look for him
5917523 once parked i could still not find jay so i made my way to the ticket collection point at the main entrance and a man from ticketmaster told me that the sos master ticket chap had not turned up and had disappointed hundreds of people
5917524 were aware that unofficial outlets claim to have had v festival tickets for sale
5917525 as concert promoters we urge the public not to get tickets from these secondary ticket outlets whether that be unofficial ticket outlets or through auction sites as it could well lead to disappointment
5917526 were sorry for those who may have been let down from certain sites and recommend checking if its an official site on www vfestival com in future
5917527 trading standards are aware of sos master tickets and are in the process of carrying out an investigation into their activity

5917537 let them make me a sanctuary that i may dwell veshakhanti among them
5917538 let them make me a sanctuary so that my shekhina will dwell among them
5917539 while the children of israel were still in egypt the holy one blessed be he stipulated that he would liberate them from egypt only in order that they built him a sanctuary so that he can let his shekhina dwell among them as soon as the tabernacle was erected the shekhina descended and dwelt among them
5917540 on that day a thing came about which had never existed since the creation of the world from the creation of the world and up to that hour the shekhina had never dwelt among the lower beings but from the time that the tabernacle was erected she did dwell among them
5917541 these are accepted by the shekhina as if they were righteous and pious persons who never sinned they are carried aloft and seated next to the shekhina he whose heart is broken and whose spirit is low and whose mouth rarely utters a word the shekhina walks with him every day
5917542 the emperor said to raban gamaliel you say that wherever ten men are assembled the shekhina dwells among them how many shekhinas are there thereupon raban gamaliel beckoned a servant and began to beat him saying why did you let the sun enter the emperors house have you gone mad said the emperor surprised at the violence of the usually gentle raban gamaliel the sun shines all over the world if the sun answered gamaliel which is only one of a thousand myriad servants of god shines all over the world how much more so the shekhina of god
5917543 the shekhina comes to the defense of sinful israel by saying first to israel be not a witness against thy neighbor without a cause and then thereafter saying to god say not i will do to him as he hath done to me
5917544 when the holy one blessed be he considered the deeds of the generation of enoch and that they were spoiled and evil he removed himself and his shekhina from their midst and ascended into the heights with blasts of trumpets
5917545 the news around the launch drove more than 64 per cent of the visits generated by the search term grocery choice to the website
5917546 it rapidly became the most popular search term although there was confusion between grocerychoice and fuelwatch with some people expecting the new initiative to follow the watch naming convention

5917557 they caused the problem and they should pay for their errors
5917558 it was never my responsibility to make sure their equipment was running properly
5917559 however six months of back billing in the absence of any further public service commission action will result in 621 000 remaining uncollected from the under billed customers
5917560 this amount would eventually be paid by questars other customers however about 98 000 that is at risk to questar would remain uncollected and be a loss to the company
5917561 we agree with the report to the extent that it indicates the company has done everything it can to resolve this problem
5917562 this really looks like it is shaping up to be a six month back billing issue or a 24 month issue
5917563 i could understand if i owed money because of a billing error
5917564 but this had to do with their equipment not being checked to make sure it was operating properly
5917565 the news around the launch drove more than 64 per cent of the visits generated by the search term grocery choice to the website
5917566 it rapidly became the most popular search term although there was confusion between grocerychoice and fuelwatch with some people expecting the new initiative to follow the watch naming convention

5917569 the only reason youre conscious right now is because i dont want to carry you
5917570 you do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother
5917571 whats particularly worrying is that huge amounts of the food and cotton we consume are grown in drier areas of the world where water resources are either already stressed or very likely to become so in the near future
5917572 we are already in discussion with wwf about our decisions about where to grow crops in the future
5917573 from our point of view weve got to look at where our growers are going to get their water from
5917574 there are massive challenges with water in places like murcia southern spain we have to look at least 10 years ahead in terms of security of supply murcia will have to look very different in five years time
5917575 well have to look at new desalination technologies and we may have to look at crops that can cope with more saline conditions such as broccoli we take tomatoes out of morocco in winter and weve looked very hard at moroccan water but its complex if you use more greenhouse production here it uses more energy peas and beans are a steady all year market weve got to think about how we get them here in a responsible manner
5917576 i really feel like the wool is being pulled over our eyes that were intentionally having to build a plan that allows a toll road to be put down the center of it
5917577 if we had put the cart before the horse in many other ways around the state we wouldnt be cramped for space when we need highway expansion or rail expansion
5917578 cars run off the road right there every week even into the oncoming lanes and theres been a few occasions where i have seen the impact residue on the roadway

5917580 people who have been part of a war that i consider immoral and illegal still have more legitimacy than people who were against the war from the very beginning and refused to fight in it
5917581 they command more of a sense of authority and more of a sense of understanding of whats actually happening on the ground generals who come out against the war are seen as more important even than congress members who are against the war
5917582 when youre coming out of the military the one thing that you lose bigger than anything else is the camaraderie of your unit
5917583 youve got family youve got friends but you dont have the people who have been there and thats a huge thing in this community we have that whether they want to live here or they want to stay a weekend or they just want to come over and watch some tv for a little while its just a space for veterans
5917584 our military is trained to kill people and were the bullies
5917585 i didnt sign up in the military to be a bully i signed up to protect people from bullies we started to talk about iraq and iraq just didnt pass the smell test
5917586 i thought that if i resisted they would put me in jail
5917587 most of us were ncos in the military so were good at telling people to clean up shit
5917588 the ptsd is so thick in the air you can cut it with a knife
5917589 i had been seeing a girl for about two weeks at the time and she was here and that ended that relationship
5917590 they let me flare up like that and they gave me that space and then as i naturally came down of that i was able to say im sorry i was not thinking naturally
5917591 if i have a conversation with a kid in high school and he decides hes not going to join the military thats a direct action
5917592 a war resister inside the military is both but that doesnt necessarily make it more effective i would rather have 1 000 high school students who would otherwise not join than one person within the military resist thats taking 1 000 bodies out of the system as opposed to taking one out
5917593 im kind of an anxious person im kind of antsy i have a lot of quirks that make people uncomfortable but being around cats like this its second nature nobody really notices it
5917594 theres a certain environment that were able to create here that is distinctly for veterans who have the freedom of mind to see that theyve been lied to that essentially a certain element of their service was for nothing
5917595 an environment that empowers them to live out their convictions

5917625 judging the ball is half the battle so i just want to make sure i dont lose that part of it
5917626 hes got the speed and he was catching the ball really well all through the offseason
5917627 hopefully hell be the guy when he gets his cast off
5917628 its hard to be a corner with a cast on but its the situation that it is and well make the best of it
5917629 look if cavemen and astronauts got into a fight who would win
5917630 i didnt know what to think it was dark in here i had waders on and it took two of us to get in through that door
5917631 people dont believe me until you see something like this
5917632 i think it looks awesome actually they did a really good job with it when i walked in for the first time after they remodeled i thought it looked really nice the new floors are beautiful
5917633 i think its been actually a blessing it was time for a remodel and its given us the chance to kind of do that
5917634 the first step was to get the mud out and the second step we tore the walls off right away
5917635 i got a lot of good customers that come from reedsburg baraboo rock springs and north freedom
5917636 i really like seeing all the regulars and the group of people i work with its a really nice atmosphere here so its a lot of fun
5917637 im disappointed that in the past they have thought the product is safe theres no problem
5917638 but i certainly want them now to be aggressive about it
5917639 i think there needs to be a great deal more clarity in their warnings
5917640 the company says you should put it on a potholder thats good but nothing in the instructions makes that really clear
5917641 above all unity in the face of continuing russian refusal
5917642 i have an order to stop them here to not let anyone go past
5917643 they just call these foreign journalists move the column in front of them and then when they are gone they put them back so there has been no withdrawal whatsoever
5917644 i just remembered my great aunt always had this and she was in leningrad
5917645 even later when she had plenty of money and food she always had this now we have to think about these things again
5917646 the campaign is in control of all the announcements and im not going to talk about my conversations with the campaign but were thrilled hes going to be in virginia tomorrow for these events
5917647 you would have to look at the travel schedule and say there may be something here that legitimizes a lot of the chatter that people are talking about
5917648 location and timing are two key things to watch for
5917649 hes kaine going to need more of an introduction to the nation meaning his announcement would happen on a wednesday or thursday giving plenty of time leading up to the convention which starts on monday to really introduce him to the public if it is not announced on those days i think it becomes much less likely hell be the nominee
5917650 i can tell you though with everybody weve talked to and even at the network level kaine is certainly among the top two
5917651 it seems to be between tim kaine and joe biden
5917652 this is the quote silly season we just dont have a lot to go on
5917653 barrack obama is really the only person who makes this decision he knows if hes made this decision at this point

5917655 vehicle safety technologies are regularly identified in state and federal road safety strategies as a countermeasure to the number of crashes and injuries
5917656 the victorian and federal governments have not taken sufficient steps to ensure that vehicle safety in australia keeps pace with international developments
5917657 the committee has seen convincing evidence that vehicles imported and even those manufactured in australia often have safety technologies removed from models sold in australia

5917659 we will have to repatriate him back to vietnam because he is on our watch list as persona non grata thai immigration cannot let him enter mr chatchawal said
5917660 he is still in the transit area at bangkok international airport he said
5917661 the doctor prescribed a painkiller and issued a certificate saying he is fit to travel
5917662 we need to control him and he will be controlled once he returns to this country
5917663 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5917664 i want gary glitter to be controlled whilst hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
5917665 renowned for her managerial skill the discipline she demands from those around her and her tight control of all things labour undertakes under her leadership
5917666 she holds generally left wing beliefs with foreign policy perspectives forged during the vietnam war she does not trust those outside a small circle in labour and her chief of staff heather simpson is known as the second most powerful person in nz known as h2
5917667 i thought it was quite funny but as i say if i was to have my cvs on other leaders fall off the back of trucks you would all have a lot of laughs as well
5917668 i am a bit surprised that dfat would draw up something that was clearly written about the time of the last election there you go maybe they need to be more efficient
5917669 were doing well given that the american market was poor last night but the commodities market was very positive and i think thats why bhp and rio are doing so well today mr heffernan said
5917670 the banks are a bit wishy washy but theyre not doing too bad
5917671 we should brace ourselves for increased prices across a wide range of goods and services
5917672 things are going to be tough for households certainly over the next 6 to 9 months
5917673 its sort of like its out of so out of this world that you cant really take it in
5917674 i think of it like im eating money not food
5917675 does she expect that she may have to raise prices some more
5917676 im afraid we might in the next six months or so yeah
5917677 a mong adults ages 18 to 49 the episode notched a 2 0 rating 5 share down a significant 29 from the march season opener 2 8 7 but good enough to make the premiere the reality shows second best
5917678 this whole situation ive just kind of been trying to force myself to get ready it can be tough at times but in an instance like tonight it can happen for just a couple of plays
5917679 well just have to wait and see what happens sometimes they come back very quickly sometimes they dont
5917680 sometimes it turns into a deep bleeding thing were hoping its not that
5917681 it was very difficult to get motivated but with the help of friends and family my agent we just keep pressing on youve got to keep looking at that light youve got to keep saying something could happen youve got to be ready for it looking at the overall picture the overall career of a player this is just one year theres a long way to go
5917682 j p s a good guy and a good teammate
5917683 right now is not the time to be thinking about anything like that i had a chance to digest everything that happened in that situation in the offseason and right now im strictly just focused on being ready
5917684 trents great no situation has changed there as far as a friendship its not his fault the situation is the way it is im pulling for him
5917685 i feel very very comfortable with turk and alex i like going to work with those guys each and every day weve agreed in the past over many things they just werent in a position to make those things come true even though the situation has changed im still with those guys and that makes coming to work that much easier
5917686 its been bothering him for a while and it really was weak so we wanted to make sure we take care of that for the game
5917687 i mean can i see atleast one dark skin black person on here
5917688 the longer fiji is burdened with an authoritarian government lacking in constitutional and legal legitimacy the greater will be our national decline
5917689 i therefore entreat the forum leaders to use all the diplomatic political and moral authority at your disposal to bring fiji back to respectability and legality
5917690 the people of fiji will owe the forum a lasting debt of gratitude if it can prevail upon commodore voreqe bainimarama and his regime to stand by their nukualofa obligation there is no reason whatsoever why an election cannot be held by march 2009
5917691 have widened our ethnic divisions created bitterness and alienation and inflicted much suffering on the people
5917692 they have been hurt through job losses shrinking incomes and widening poverty there have been countless abuses of human rights and constitutional freedoms cronyism and nepotism have reached unprecedented heights
5917693 from the forums perspective the fiji situation represents a real challenge
5917694 never in the history of the forum has a member country reneged on an assurance freely given to the island leaders
5917695 the shame of this for fiji is that under the leadership of ratu sir kamisese mara we were instrumental in the founding of the forum it was his vision that provided the initial guiding influence
5917696 ms taylor is at home and happy and busier than ever

5917701 were a couple of steps away from where i was four years ago
5917702 but we have shown a couple of times weve been up there
5917703 canada has always had a really good history in mountain biking
5917704 we maybe dont have the depth but the riders that we do bring to international competition are usually in the running
5917705 there is a strong connection to mountain biking in our culture much more than say track or road especially where these riders are from in the mountains it is the culture there
5917706 from sudden complications stemming from his june atv accident on his farm near charlottesville virginia

5917709 but i think that simona can fight for a medal in beijing
5917710 today was a pretty good day i really pushed it i gave it my all to see what i could do
5917711 i hate to look so far down the road because this is a tricky situation
5917712 its one of those things where it feels really good one day and you come back another day and its sore
5917713 its one of those injuries where you have to really monitor and make sure im not overdoing it
5917714 i am not one that believes that isolating russia is the right answer to its misdemeanours
5917715 i was confident today because my bike was fast from friday practice and with jeremy we made a small modification to the front after warm up to allow me to be a bit faster in some sections and it worked very well i lost about half a second getting past hopkins at the start and casey was incredibly fast at that stage like hed already done ten laps for a short time i was worried but then after two laps i understood that my bike was working very well and that i was fast enough to try to catch him i had closed a little bit already and gradually the red bike was becoming a bit bigger in front of me and i think this is when he started to push harder and made his mistake i was anticipating a very hard battle if i did catch him so when i saw the red bike slide out i could hardly believe it this made things a lot easier for me after that i just enjoyed riding my bike my bridgestone tyres worked very well until the end and my m1 felt very good of course i cant count this as a complete victory because casey fell and i am sorry for him but this is racing and i have to be happy with this result we are 50 points clear which is a lot and i am very excited to be going to misano in this situation however we know that 50 points is still not always enough when you have someone as strong as casey and so we wont relax now we have two days of testing and we will try some new electronics in order to help me open the throttle earlier and also of course test some bridgestone tyres
5917716 of course this is a very important victory for us and were very happy today its clear that valentino did a very good job at the start not to let stoner get too far ahead and he was starting to make up ground and put some pressure on him when he unfortunately crashed of course this made our job a lot easier we need to keep going like this and not lose our concentration but weve had two very good races and we are confident that we are in good shape we have two days of testing now which will be very important for the final six races and then we go to another home race at misano and try to make up for last year
5917717 this race is a bit sad for me because we have the potential to do a lot better however considering what has happened this weekend and above all the problems with the front tyre i think we have done almost as much as we could at the start i didnt want to take too many risks and i could feel that the front tyre was getting worse on each lap but on the other hand the rear tyre was getting better each lap i know that we have had had problems this weekend but i know that michelin are working very hard so now we will try to use the test to make some improvements i want to say thank you to all of my team for their hard work congratulate valentino for his victory and finally also toni elias for his podium
5917718 today we couldnt have done any better than this but we cant be satisfied to finish tenth but overall jorge did a great job and a good race and he was able to find a good rhythm in the middle part of the race continue until to the end and pass many riders plus he was able to score some valuable points motivation in our team is still high because we have many more races to do and tomorrow at the test we will start again to work very hard with michelin look at the problems we have had here and try to find a way to improve things for the remaining races
5917719 it was a difficult race and the result is clearly not where we want to be i dont want to be fighting at the back of the top 15 and neither does my team or yamaha and it is disappointing all i can do is go out there with whatever i have got underneath me and give it my maximum and i did that but this team and yamaha deserve to be higher up and today wasnt good enough it would be easy to let my head drop but i have never been that type of rider and i am not going to start now i was reasonably happy with my start but i had a few moments with the front tyre on the first couple of laps and i soon realised that i was at my maximum and that i wasnt going to be able to do much more it is disappointing because i have slipped out of the top ten in the standings and that was one of my big goals before the start of the season we have got to keep working hard as a team and hope that michelin can quickly turn it around for the rest of the season so we can try and get back into that top ten and keep the morale up of the team colin had even more problems than me so it must have been tough for him but this is the situation we are in we will all keep pushing hard and see what we can do
5917720 i could see straightaway behind james that he was having some issues with the front tyre which we expected i still thought i could put a good pace together but it never happened i just didnt have the confidence i needed to push harder with the tyres and the more i pushed i didnt seem to go much faster james was able to leave me pretty easily as my issues started to get worse but i wanted to stay out there and try my best for my guys at tech 3 and yamaha who as always have been working like crazy to help me this weekend i thank them for that but there was nothing else i could do towards the end i just decided to take a few more risks and i went a bit quicker but there was no way i was going to catch anybody ive had a bad run lately but im still in contention for fourth in the championship and ill keep fighting but we need big improvements from michelin the good start we had to the season seems like a long way away now and we have to work with michelin to try and solve some of the issues because i didnt enjoy today at all
5917721 we thought the disappointment of laguna seca would be forgotten after the summer break and we would have a positive weekend in brno unfortunately from the very beginning of the weekend we understood it was going to be another tough weekend clearly we couldnt challenge the tyre opposition we have been trying a lot of different settings to try and cope with that but it was difficult the most difficult was qualifying in the rain conditions and we were far behind we knew starting from the last two rows it would be a tough race but james and colin still tried as hard as they could and they stayed on track and scored a few points but this is not how we started the championship and today was a really difficult day to see the chequered flag with a few points is a relief but for sure there will be a lot of meetings and a lot of thinking of what to do for the future because we keep on losing ground in the championship and this is very disappointing

5917724 the mystics have been operating for too long without a long term plan
5917725 thank you ms last name of person who broke my heart two years ago
5917726 he was a great christian fellow and did a great job for us
5917727 he did feel left behind because organizations modernized and got away from the basics of sound knowledge and sound religious practices to just having a party and he didnt like that idea
5917728 he thought if you gave them the sound basics theyd manage to have fun without making a party out of it
5917729 he was a great christian fellow and did a great job for us
5917730 i dont think there was one time he said something or played a note that wasnt thought out
5917731 i dont think he ever talked about the importance of anything

5917767 my bags got lost again it was a bit of a worry because i have a special olympics outfit to wear but luckily they arrived today
5917768 i settled into the chair and miss green stabbed me in the arm
5917769 when i say stabbed i mean freddie cougar has nothing on greenie
5917770 after the first stab she quickly realised she didnt get enough out of the war wound she had created and zoned in on my left arm
5917771 at that moment just as she was about to slash my left arm javier gomez one of his triathlon rivals walks into the room
5917772 the white house isnt the place to learn how to deal with international crisis the balance of power war and peace and the economic future of the next generation a president has got to know the territory but thats not enough
5917773 he refused to board the plane last night and now is being confined at the transit lounge we will not allow him to enter the country
5917774 speak to the israelites and say to them if anyone makes a special vow to dedicate persons to the lord by giving equivalent values
5917775 if what he vowed is an animal that is acceptable as an offering to the lord such an animal given to the lord becomes holy
5917776 if a man dedicates his house as something holy to the lord the priest will judge its quality as good or bad whatever value the priest then sets so it will remain
5917777 if a man dedicates to the lord part of his family land its value is to be set according to the amount of seed required for it fifty shekels of silver to a homer of barley seed
5917778 if a man dedicates to the lord a field he has bought which is not part of his family land
5917779 no one however may dedicate the firstborn of an animal since the firstborn already belongs to the lord whether an ox or a sheep it is the lords
5917780 but nothing that a man owns and devotes to the lord whether man or animal or family land may be sold or redeemed everything so devoted is most holy to the lord
5917781 no person devoted to destruction may be ransomed he must be put to death
5917782 a tithe of everything from the land whether grain from the soil or fruit from the trees belongs to the lord it is holy to the lord
5917783 it has served our texaco and havoline brands well we value the partnership and professionalism of our nascar teams and the support that our loyal nascar fans have provided over the years
5917784 nascar has been a first class experience for us due in large part to chip ganassi racing with felix sabates cgrfs we wish them the best in their pursuit of the cup
5917785 we are pleased to have represented texaco and havoline over the past five years
5917786 despite the success of our partnership we understand that priorities change and wish chevron the best in implementing its new marketing initiatives
5917787 we have seen an increased level of interest in residential lighting over the past year as many customers are looking for inexpensive ways to add value to their homes

5917794 the leading contender was actually a song 20 20 by george benson
5917795 it had a pretty good vibe but it wasnt quite right it didnt really talk football at all we called hank williams jr and spoke to his manager a great guy by the name of merle kilgore and we asked if hank would have any interest in working on mnf we asked if he knew anything about football and merles reply was does hank know football hank is an american he knows football and ever since then that was it
5917796 the story i got was that the son of one of the producers of mnf had my tape in his tape player the producer said what is that the truth is usually stranger than what you can make up and that is how it went down when it comes on for that 60 seconds it hits you right in the face and makes you go wow it really gets people in a good mood and pumped up and ready for the game it has been a wonderful ride i have had a lot of fun doing it and im going to have a lot more fun
5917797 twitter can be an amazingly powerful platform for connecting to your community as well as driving traffic to the various properties you want people to go having an event tweet it out launched a new bag tweet it out the key to twitter is the level of listening you do as well as talking it is definitely supposed to be an interactive program and in fact this is where you build the majority of your whuffie aka social capital the more you interact on twitter the more people will interact with you which attracts others to you as well
5917798 i wanted to start with some basic guiding principles that should be used to guide social media participation particularly for companies these should apply to participation in most online social media environments and social networks
5917799 since saturday night ive seen a lot of confusion in the younger christian voting bloc because they thought they had figured this thing out
5917800 theres no absolutely right candidate for an evangelical and theres no absolutely wrong candidate theyre both right and theyre both wrong
5917801 to be perceived as authentic on this issue you need to have some grounding in it and usually that grounding is faith
5917802 essentially says that a doctor is required to provide treatment to a pre viable child or fetus
5917803 and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
5917804 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
5917805 would make a fatal mistake to assume that social issues especially abortion are ever off an equally blazing front burner for an inestimable number of social conservatives

5917816 we assume it was some sort of a set up
5917817 there have been people in and out for the last few months
5917818 we dont know if there was anything consistent or not
5917819 individually most politicians have a deep understanding of the plight of our health care system
5917820 collectively especially at the federal level they are reluctant even afraid of engaging in a meaningful public policy discussion on health for example in last octobers throne speech i listened as the topic of health care was almost completely ignored by our conservative government
5917821 not to be outdone the liberal party of canada recently sent out a questionnaire based on what they identified as todays issues of crucial significance
5917822 of 16 questions in their poll not one question related to health care
5917823 for those of you who followed those movies like i did darth vader was actually a good guy because when it came to the point when he was actually going to kill luke skywalker he gave in and actually went from the dark side to the good side
5917824 despite the best efforts of medical schools to expand we have actually dropped further in the oecd rankings this year
5917825 in canada we pay dearly to keep patients on waiting lists this is illogical preventing patients from getting treatment is not my definition of preventive medicine
5917826 this excluded the growing costs of waiting to see a gp or specialist and it excluded the costs as patients deteriorate and develop chronic severe irreversible damage addiction to painkillers or depression
5917827 we have to fix the system or it will be a long time before the economy recovers
5917828 the general public wants some standards that they can respect and be protected by on a national basis
5917829 invariably somebodys ox gets gored but right now we dont have a uniformed standard and thats part of the problem
5917830 sen casey believes that a disturbing byproduct of the increased rates of foreclosure as shown by these ap stories is an increase in the number unscrupulous individuals who corrupt the appraisal process to artificially inflate home prices to increase profits by cheating home buyers
5917831 four and a half to five months ago we thought something was wrong
5917832 nicole had headaches which have always been a problem a lack of energy she couldnt sleep and she now has short term memory loss
5917833 things have gone to a chronic state and at the moment sleep is the only escape from pain excruciating pain
5917834 had we had nicole diagnosed back in may and given antibiotics yes thats right antibiotics she would be well by now
5917835 we are now looking at life threatening conditions neurological involvement including no short term memory hallucinations of horrifying proportions and pain soaring on a scale of 1 10 or 40 even with massive narcotic pain meds
5917836 doctors in a comfortable state do not want to manage nicoles pain they want to be under the radar they dont recognize acute lyme disease its just amazing
5917837 i need to sell the house we need a huge amount of cash and we need to be closer to victoria for school and medical we have no idea what direction this is going to take it is undermining what we have built but thats not the issue our daughter is the most important thing you do what you have to do we just hope she gets her mind back
5917838 all because doctors in canada do not have the education to diagnose
5917839 she said dad i just want you to see me like this
5917840 where does one go for treatment for chronic and acute lyme disease in canada
5917841 if our governments are unable to fund the education of the number of doctors we need we must consider alternatives public private partnerships are used in such circumstances to build infrastructure including roads bridges and hospitals lets explore similar initiatives to develop new medical schools
5917842 shocking that 1 500 young highly educated canadians are currently attending medical schools outside of canada
5917843 we must not deny any patient access to essential health care based on ability to pay nor should we deny access based on a shortage of doctors hospital beds or operating time
5917844 competition consumer choice and market principles barely exist in our health system yet health care is subject to normal economic pressures and principles
5917845 as we meet at the time of the olympic games and as canada looks forward to hosting the 2010 winter games lets note that three of the six main olympic values excellence universality sustainability are similar to our values and aspirations for a truly great health system
5917846 and of course an integral part of the olympics is competition without competition we cannot expect improvement let alone excellence
5917847 i believe that if we are to preserve universal health care for the next generation we need to embrace similar principles
5917848 individually most politicians have a deep understanding of the plight of our health care system
5917849 collectively especially at the federal level they are reluctant even afraid of engaging in a meaningful public policy discussion on health for example in last octobers throne speech i listened as the topic of health care was almost completely ignored by our conservative government
5917850 not to be outdone the liberal party of canada recently sent out a questionnaire based on what they identified as todays issues of crucial significance
5917851 of 16 questions in their poll not one question related to health care
5917852 in canada we pay dearly to keep patients on waiting lists this is illogical preventing patients from getting treatment is not my definition of preventive medicine
5917853 this excluded the growing costs of waiting to see a gp or specialist and it excluded the costs as patients deteriorate and develop chronic severe irreversible damage addiction to painkillers or depression
5917854 there does not appear to be any pattern of any type where there is an attempt to harm someone

5917856 there is at this point no evidence whatsoever any public officials were targeted or any political maneuverings going on
5917857 it is a great joy to build a car and know exactly how much fun customers will have with it
5917858 surface water pro uses greenstar tm components that many of our customers already own
5917859 compared to a laser system that has high start up costs the surface water pro software is an economical more accurate alternative for managing ditches and levees
5917860 the survey mode records elevations of their fields for later use
5917861 survey points do not need to be recorded as a separate operation and can be collected while doing work in the field such as during planting harvesting or tillage all elevation information is recorded and saved on a data card and can be downloaded to desktop software such as apex
5917862 apex desktop software is used to manage the information collected for ditch track and levee track data
5917863 three types of maps can be collected and saved with apex including depression flow direction and digitized elevation maps
5917864 for advanced ditching operations weve also introduced surface water pro plus
5917865 integrated with the gs2 2600 display this new system takes water management to the next level and brings advanced technology for improved ditching functions
5917866 there are two methods to create a ditch with surface water pro plus
5917867 the first is linear drain which is much like a laser system because it uses a straight line to create a grade where the water is pooled and where it needs to exit the field
5917868 the second is a best fit drain which creates a non linear path by which the ditch will be cut the line is calculated so that the least amount of soil is moved to efficiently guide the water off the field this reduces time and fuel needed to create ditches and gives operators the ability to edit ditch track lines that were previously created

5917881 maybe some people are wired to be more sexual and also to have better erections for a longer period of time
5917882 do as the spirit moves you and make decisions about sexuality that are comfortable for you and your partner
5917883 if we put it onto our calendar when we have to have sex i think we lose the positive effect of sex on health

5917891 we are fighting to put food on the table and gas in our tanks youre taxing the hard working people eighty dollars out of our checks is really hurting us
5917892 our judgment call is that the better thing to do is to pursue the income tax measure
5917893 but it will hurt those below us and if you take the bottom out of them then the whole thing collapses

5917922 lance has a lot of similar characteristics to wayne chrebet just the way he runs his routes and makes plays
5917923 he has a long way to go to match what wayne has done but its exciting to see a young player who can do some of those things
5917924 watching film he said that looks like wayne chrebet running a route its an honor
5917925 i feel ive got a long ways to go i just go out there and try to treat every day like its my last day my last opportunity to try and make it

5917933 parents should optimise sleep quality for their family with regular sleep and wake times and bedrooms should be quiet dark and conducive to sleep
5917934 i think its a hard sell and i dont see much upside to tom ridge except for john mccain likes him a lot
5917935 i dont think hes going to be a big benefit in pennsylvania and even if he is i think the downside is the rest of the country among conservatives are going to be upset about this just at the moment theyre beginning to work up being excited about john mccain

5917944 with this increased inflammation more than it showed last time our doctors have recommended that he pretty much rest some more
5917945 how much time we dont know were not going to put a specific time on it but billy will be not activated
5917946 i dont see how i could go out there and help the team
5917947 i dont think i could pitch effectively to begin with or come back and pitch the next day
5917948 i want to play i want to compete theres only so much time in a career and i want to get out there and help my teammates were in a great situation right now were leading our division and we got a great chance to go to the playoffs you want to be a part of that and so for me im very frustrated
5917949 que mostra de maneira bem humorada o novo recurso do
5917950 it wasnt any sort of whole scale changes it was just trying to find the best way to do things
5917951 believe me theres a lot of wasted trees out there as ive always said throughout my career
5917952 for the most part its things that people dont see that we have to get on board with in a hurry
5917953 sight adjustments audibles things like that whats the easiest way for me to get to those is it using the term thats in place or is it coming up with a new term and not to mention changing it up and having more than one term for a lot of things its a work in progress and i think that will be the case all year long
5917954 i was in the same offense for a decade for the most part
5917955 bretts been in the same offense for what 17 years almost or something when you have that comfort zone all of a sudden you have to change your thinking process you have to go ok this word means this here and ok that word means something else now its a challenge
5917956 we shrunk it the playbook a little with him in the beginning
5917957 weve still been adding some things hes been taking in the plays pretty well and hes been progressing in the process hes been doing a great job
5917958 ive said this from day 1 that its much easier for one to get on board with 10 than 10 to get on board with one
5917959 imaginary candidate to do that because hes been pitching too well
5917960 surgery was always the last resort but unfortunately thats what it came down to
5917961 i am also shattered that i cant lead the australian davis cup team in chile in our bid to rejoin the world group and hope that the boys can still come through with a great win
5917962 i am looking forward to playing again in january in my home country and using that as a springboard to compete at my best again on the world stage for at least a couple of more years
5917963 oh my g d that is the coolest person alive
5917964 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5917965 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5917966 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5917967 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5917968 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5917969 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5917970 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5917971 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5917972 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5917973 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5917974 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5917975 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5917976 this complaint arose out of viewing vacation pictures on his personal laptop
5917977 i was extremely disturbed when i became aware of how much time and the type of content he was looking at with city computers and on city time
5917978 we were told there were certain days where he was on there for several hours at a time
5917979 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5917980 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5917981 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5917982 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5917983 considering the plight of any other living being let alone cows while i have no idea where my next meal is coming from is a completely normal and anything less is selfish
5917984 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5917985 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5917986 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5917987 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5917988 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5917989 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5917990 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5917991 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5917992 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5917993 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5917994 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5917995 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5917996 who are open to doing something on the production side
5917997 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5917998 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5917999 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5918000 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5918001 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5918002 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5918003 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5918004 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5918005 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5918006 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5918007 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5918008 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5918009 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5918010 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5918011 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5918012 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5918013 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5918014 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5918015 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5918016 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5918017 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5918018 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5918019 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5918020 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5918021 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5918022 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5918023 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5918024 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5918025 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5918026 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5918027 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5918028 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5918029 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5918030 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5918031 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5918032 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5918033 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5918034 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5918035 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5918036 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5918037 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5918038 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5918039 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5918040 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5918041 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5918042 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5918043 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5918044 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5918045 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5918046 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5918047 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5918048 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5918049 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5918050 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5918051 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5918052 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5918053 surely there is enough for everyone within this country it is a tragedy that these good things are not more widely shared all our children ought to be allowed a stake in the enormous richness of america whether they were born to poor white appalachians or to wealthy texans to poor black people in the bronx or to rich people in manhasset they are all quite wonderful and innocent when they are small we soil them needlessly
5918054 language takes meanings from the context in which it is used and in spoken language the distinctions between language and context and language and culture begin to blur
5918055 i was just 13 when one of my best friends brothers was about to sign a contract with london football team leyton orient
5918056 but one day he was walking the streets saw a fight went over to help got stabbed in the back and was paralysed
5918057 no one wants to see the devastation i saw my friend and his family go through we have to lend our support to this campaign you dont expect situations that are happening whereby people go to school in the morning and then you never see them again because of incidents that have happened

5918116 a toronto based non profit group wired more than 3 million to overseas bank accounts some of them linked to the tamil tigers before it was shut down by the government in june for alleged terrorist financing says an rcmp report released yesterday
5918117 is utilized as a vehicle to forward money to the ltte liberation tigers of tamil eelam from canada
5918118 the 83 page financial report is the fruit of two years of analysis of banking records seized by canadian anti terrorism police who are investigating a financial network run by supporters of the tamil tigers that allegedly raised money in canada to buy arms for the guerrillas
5918119 the bank records seized demonstrate that the world tamil movement has developed an elaborate machine like entity that moves throughout the greater toronto area collecting funds with extreme proficiency
5918120 stockwell day public safety minister announced on june 16 that his government had added the wtm to ottawas official list of terrorist groups alongside the likes of al qaeda hamas and hezbollah the wtm is the first canadian community group to be listed
5918121 the wtm has denied any involvement in terrorist fundraising and vowed to challenge the governments decision and at a large outdoor rally in toronto on july 5 tamils waved tamil tigers flags and endorsed a statement condemning ottawas decision to ban the wtm
5918122 the minister has accused the wtm of transferring money to ltte bank accounts in sri lanka but the rcmps feb 1 2008 financial report paints a more detailed picture of a complex network made up of 20 canadian bank accounts
5918123 five banks held the accounts toronto dominion bank of nova scotia royal bank cibc and the national bank of canada the canadian account holders wired money regularly to accounts in malaysia singapore the united kingdom and tamil tigers controlled areas of sri lanka
5918124 rcmp corporal deanna hill the author of the police report wrote that the wtms financial set up was
5918125 i also believe that the number of accounts alone demonstrate that the world tamil movement has utilized the canadian banking system to raise funds in a manner that is best suited to financing the terrorist activities of the ltte
5918126 the tamil tigers have been fighting for 25 years for an independent homeland for sri lankas ethnic tamil minority which has faced discrimination under the islands sinhalese majority
5918127 in addition to fighting a conventional guerrilla war however the tigers also employ terrorist tactics such as suicide bombings and political assassinations which has landed them on international terrorist lists canadas included
5918128 the rcmp began investigating the tamil tigers canadian fundraising network in 2002 focusing on the wtms large head office in toronto and its smaller branch offices in montreal and vancouver police raided the toronto and montreal offices in 2006
5918129 police seized letters from the tamil tigers leadership thanking canada for its donations explaining how the money had been used to purchase weapons and asking for more but much of the police evidence appears to have come from a study of bank accounts held by the wtm and its officers
5918130 the project osaluki financial report claims the wtms most lucrative fundraising method was a pre authorized payment program in which the group persuaded hundreds of its supporters to sign forms allowing money to be withdrawn from their bank accounts each month
5918131 the wtm took in up to 763 000 a year using the payment scheme
5918132 it is obvious from the amounts collected with this method that the pre authorized payment scheme is effective timely and spares valued resources
5918133 most of the forms had been signed in canada but police also interviewed witnesses who said they had signed them at tamil tigers checkpoints in sri lanka
5918134 upon their return to canada these persons were visited by representatives of the world tamil movement to exact the collection of the monthly stipend

5918148 the committee has seen convincing evidence that vehicles imported and even those manufactured in australia often have safety technologies removed from models sold in australia

5918172 muchas chicas y chicos que se inician sexualmente lo hacen con total desconocimiento de su anatom a y fisiolog a motivados por inquietudes que nadie supo responderles ni en el marco de la familia ni en la escuela por eso les ponen el cuerpo a la curiosidad y las dudas
5918173 est probado que un chico o chica que recibi educaci n sexual retarda en dos o tres a os el inicio de las relaciones y que cuando las tiene lo hace en el marco de una relaci n de amor con otro que es lo recomendable
5918174 entran sin filtro en sus vidas y les muestran una forma de ejercer la sexualidad que no es apropiado que es m s bien una ficci n y que en general est vinculado con cierta violencia donde se muestra una mujer objeto y donde jam s se usa el preservativo

5918201 my bags got lost again it was a bit of a worry because i have a outfit to wear but luckily they arrived today
5918202 i settled into the chair and miss green stabbed me in the arm
5918203 when i say stabbed i mean freddie cougar has nothing on greenie
5918204 after the first stab she quickly realised she didnt get enough out of the war wound she had created and zoned in on my left arm
5918205 at that moment just as she was about to slash my left arm javier gomez one of his triathlon rivals walks into the room
5918206 californias highest court was unanimous in its decision on monday that christian doctors may not refuse to perform artificial insemination for homosexual patients
5918207 the state high court said the doctors constitutional rights to freedom of religion did not trump the state antidiscrimination law because the state has a compelling interest in ensuring full and equal access to medical care
5918208 he refused to board the plane last night and now is being confined at the transit lounge we will not allow him to enter the country
5918209 we will have to repatriate him back to vietnam because he is on our watch list as persona non grata thai immigration cannot let him enter
5918210 we need to control him and he will be controlled once he returns to this country
5918211 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5918212 right now there are russian soldiers and tanks at poti
5918213 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5918214 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5918215 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
5918216 targeting u s and other nato forces and afghan forces have become larger and bolder and they include direct almost conventional style attacks
5918217 in late 2006 and into 2007 there was a much greater reluctance among the taliban and other groups to carry out these conventional style attacks
5918218 they clearly believe they are winning now and its caused them to be a bit more audacious
5918219 heartfelt thanks for the sacrifice that they are making and the commitment that the french are making to help secure afghanistan
5918220 its important to remember that we are all engaged in a serious effort to bring about a stable afghanistan
5918221 france will continue to assume its responsibilities in favor of a democratic and peaceful afghanistan and in the fight against terrorism
5918222 the historical data tell us clearly dont get too used to commodity export booms as any third world country will tell you they tend to go away pretty quickly
5918223 is that we have been able to greatly increase corn exports while also using it for ethanol only by increasing the acreage devoted to corn have we been able to do this and by squeezing down the use of corn for domestic livestock feed
5918224 the court ruled there were no historic or religious documents that state the child should be denied the rights of education movement etc she should not be denied these things just because she is the kumari
5918225 this is not good news in any case she is a goddess so how can court rulings apply
5918226 her teacher comes to the kumari palace every day and she has three hours a day when she can meet people
5918227 we will ask the goddess if she wants to go outside more and if she wants she can go but i dont think she feels comfortable leaving the palace
5918228 if a manned airplane is on a conveyor belt and both are going at the airplanes takeoff speed but in opposite directions will the plane be held where it is or will it take off
5918229 will the plane be held where it is or will it take off
5918230 it has now become increasingly apparent that some are insistent that there be a religious test for the position of the vice presidency
5918231 if a mormon cannot be considered today for high office who will be eliminated from the same consideration tomorrow
5918232 i think romney would be very acceptable to the foreign policy conservatives and the economic conservatives
5918233 but i think its fair to say that about 15 to 20 percent of evangelicals would have a difficult time voting for a mormon on either side of the ticket
5918234 i no longer need the mask as much as i used to so now it becomes like how much pleasure am i going to take in playing a mask character
5918235 our global distribution and marketing platform is uniquely positioned to help them accelerate the growth of their fan base and maximize their earnings across all their potential revenue streams
5918236 a live nation situation is unique because they actually have the facility to put artists in venues they have a ticketing service effective next year and they have their own merchandising company
5918237 as the deals scale down to newer artists splits will be different and nets will be defined differently
5918238 most companies dont have the venues they dont have the merchandising so that raises the question of whether artists should give up those rights
5918239 wheres their expertise if you just chase radio markets are these good live markets
5918240 with the disintegration of the labels theres a lot of talent out there thats not working but knows marketing touring physical and digital distribution and other core competencies
5918241 its very hard to compare deals because you are comparing apples to oranges to bananas
5918242 deals can be 270 they can be 180 sometimes publishing is involved sometimes merchandising is involved and the touring can be all over the place
5918243 john was one of our most respected professors and the students just loved him because he had one foot in the realm of scholarship and one in the practical world of politics
5918244 when he would get up to justify how he was going to vote you would always say to yourself why didnt i think of that
5918245 he cared deeply about the process and about the state
5918246 whether it was through his service in the minnesota house and senate or as a highly regarded professor brandl always pushed government to perform at its very best
5918247 more than a whole generation of poor kids have been lost
5918248 weve got to be trying things different from what weve been trying for those kids
5918249 he cared that families lived lives of meaning and dignity
5918250 had a quiet command of the classroom because he exuded competence he could relate things more effectively because he was in the arena
5918251 he was somebody that was pushing us in a much more thoughtful direction

5918256 i am a bit surprised that dfat would draw up something that was clearly written about the time of the last election there you go maybe they need to be more efficient
5918257 i think it is a pretty minor thing i had a bit of a laugh
5918258 any entity which is radically smarter than human beings would also be very powerful
5918259 however at the same time they are also responsible for the affairs of their own nations and i think they must not be unnecessarily preoccupied with forum matters because of this the essence of delegation and priority setting requires another look by leaders to engage our ministers in decision making and only reserve those matters requiring high level political consideration for the attention of the leaders
5918260 there may be scope for new initiatives to refine the current arrangements in order to further focus the agenda of leaders such as greater use of existing or new ministerial mechanisms to oversee progress in relevant areas of the forum work
5918261 the challenges for the region are no longer a matter for research or scientific theory and modeling the evidence is quite clear that climate change is already wreaking havoc here who could have believed that my own country which is so much higher above sea level than many countries in the pacific could be battered by a severe cyclone the way it was in 2004
5918262 we shouldnt wait until a worse human catastrophe occurs before acting and the international attention now focused on climate change presents an opportunity for the region to negotiate and secure tangible assistance for people already affected by climate change
5918263 while mitigation measures are also important the frequency of severe cyclones and rising sea levels confirm that any meaningful responses must entail practical provisions for adaption
5918264 i understand mr urwin was exemplary in his leadership of the pacific islands forum secretariat during his more than four years with the secretariat he managed to raise the secretariat to a new level of credibility and performance it is sad that he has passed away but his legacy will leave on
5918265 the most difficult thing was to answer their question where was god

5918267 the apocalyptic opening lines of bob dylans all along the watchtower seem to capture the beleaguered mindset of the uk commercial real estate market
5918268 there is no real depth of evidence of willing buyers and sellers the rics valuation standards assumption financing remains difficult and sellers are reluctant to crystallise lower prices
5918269 if the thieves are the funded or equity based opportunist buyers and the jokers are the owners who wont sell there is no way out of this impasse yet

5918431 do 254 certifiable ip is a huge productivity gain for our customers who have to comply with the do 254 standard
5918432 now instead of having to reverse engineer or re develop a commonly used component companies can actually reap the productivity benefit of off the shelf certifiable networking and processor ip with the confidence of knowing that it supports the design assurance needs of their flows and thus does not present a certification risk
5918433 dealing with cots ip under the guidance of do 254 has been one of the industrys biggest challenges to date im excited to see vendors like altera and mentor taking the initiative to address a very important aspect of these flows to make cots ip compliant with do 254 their efforts could save hardware applicants a lot of resources and frustration
5918434 working with altera on do 254 certifiable ip is the next step for us in supporting the needs of this market
5918435 mentor has been investing in solutions for do 254 certification for several years this initiative lets us leverage both our methodology expertise and tools to not only provide the industry with high quality ip but also the tool and methodology guidance that many are seeking
5918436 wimax has gained such momentum across so many regions that it is no longer sensible to suggest that wimax growth will be flattened by the emergence of lte in the next few years in populous countries with poor national telecom infrastructure such as india brazil and africa there is a lack of broadband services and even of basic voice services which is a significant driver for wimax adoption in many developing countries with india being the prime example wimax is showing promising signs of becoming the primary broadband infrastructure and a prominent 3g mobile technology india is absolutely critical to the fortunes of wimax and the level of uptake there will help decide how prominent a position 802 16e takes in the overall wireless landscape in the next decade

5918508 public officials who with knowledge and consent uphold actions that are against the divine and eternal moral law for example if they support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives a person who commits sin in this way should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
5918509 if a person who has been admonished persists in public mortal sin and attempts to receive communion the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it to him why above all for the salvation of that person preventing him from committing a sacrilege
5918510 we must avoid giving people the impression that one can be in a state of mortal sin and receive the eucharist
5918511 secondly there could be another form of scandal consisting of leading people to think that the public act that this person is doing which until now everyone believed was a serious sin is really not that serious if the church allows him or her to receive communion
5918512 if we have a public figure who is openly and deliberately upholding abortion rights and receiving the eucharist what will the average person think he or she could come to believe that it up to a certain point it is okay to do away with an innocent life in the mothers womb
5918513 it is not with the intention of interfering in public life but rather in the spiritual state of the politician or public official who if catholic should follow the divine law in the public sphere as well

5918724 as such the tighter monetary policy stance has yielded its desired impact on monetary aggregates decelerating the expansion in aggregate demand
5918725 inflation which became a global concern over the past year with the unexpected surge in world fuel and food prices has shown signs of deceleration in sri lanka from july 2008
5918726 with the easing of commodity prices in international markets external price pressures on domestic inflation are likely to further abate in the months ahead
5918727 this decline was supported by improvements in domestic supply side factors and the containment of demand pressures

5918733 the health and safety of our residents is our top priority
5918734 even one instance of confirmed abuse or neglect is too many
5918735 we actually have a core staff of unbelievably dedicated wonderful people who are dedicated to providing the best care possible for our residents
5918736 the staff that we have worked with have been very responsible and loving and diligent in what they do
5918737 i dont know under what circumstances anybody would condone the idea of staff members of the opposite sex being that intimately involved
5918738 we only use a caretaker of the opposite gender to provide services such as bathing on an as needed basis

5918749 is it okay for atheists to try to change peoples minds to try to convince people that their religion is mistaken and that they should de convert and become atheists instead and is there any difference between that and religious evangelicalism
5918750 it seems to me that unless you are going door to door or are in another persons face about it then you are not being evangelical even dawkins doesnt strike me that way because no one forces you to read his books and he is invited to speak to give his views
5918751 evangelism is not wrong be it religious atheistic or anything else we evangelise our views every day in our kids when we vote based on what we think is right whenever we express any opinion or any argument not based on a double blind peer reviewed scientific study so let the religious poeple evangelise and the atheists can evangelise too in the end may the best arguments win

5918770 now youre supposing that since god didnt tell us that other planets are or are not inhabited or inhabitable that that gives us enough to consider alien life to me that sounds a bit pompous
5918771 but if we dont discover alien life and so far we arguably havent then you have to admit my arguments could possibly be correct
5918772 1 but does the bible really take a non committal stance i think youre supposing that it does 2 but what if there are no aliens then that would be another reason why the bible appears to be non committal 3 but rather than being non committal the absence of any mention of aliens is simply because god didnt create them 4 why mention aliens unicorns fairies goblins and centaurs in the bible if they dont exist so since the bible doesnt mention minotaurs does that mean we should speculate their existence of course not that would be ridiculous hence its ridiculous to think that since the bible doesnt mention aliens that gives us the freedom to speculate on their existence
5918773 now youre supposing that since god didnt tell us that other planets are or are not inhabited or inhabitable that that gives us enough to consider alien life to me that sounds a bit pompous

5918780 after seven years of error upon error the policies underlying the existence of guantanamo are embedded in law and executive pronouncements reversing this will require bold action
5918781 the administrations misguided attempt to protect national security by creating a law free zone has had the opposite effect providing americas enemies with an easy recruiting tool while discouraging the cooperation of our allies and failing to bring terrorists to justice

5918817 there remains only one obstacle from which the enemy calls him from and this is an obstacle that he must face if anyone were to be saved from this obstacle it would have been the messengers and prophets of allah and the noblest of his creation this is the obstacle of satan unleashing his troops upon the believer with various types of harm by way of the hand the tongue and the heart this occurs in accordance with the degree of goodness that exists within the believer so the higher he is in degree the more the enemy unleashes his troops and helps them against him and overwhelms him with his followers and allies in various ways there is no way around this obstacle because the firmer he is in calling to allah and fulfilling his commands the more the enemy becomes intent upon deceiving him with foolish people so he has essentially put on his body armor in this obstacle and has taken it upon himself to confront the enemy for allahs sake and in his name and his worship in doing so is the worship of the best of worshippers

5918890 a belief in god is a hypothesis about the world
5918891 if god acts on the physical world we should be able to see and document that effect
5918892 a religious belief is a hypothesis about the workings of the real external non subjective world that we all live in
5918893 we are not moving towards general agreement and consensus on certain basic issues the way science is when it comes to religious beliefs we are every bit as divided now as we have ever been in all of human history
5918894 the reality is that we do not see the effects of god on the physical world in any way that we can recognize and document and agree on
5918895 think of all the people in history who intuitively knew that black people were mentally inferior to white people
5918896 gathering knowledge about the world is not the domain of religion nor is speaking on how the world works
5918897 he spreads out the northern skies over empty space he suspends the earth over nothing
5918898 the reality is that we do not see the effects of god on the physical world in any way that we can recognize and document and agree on
5918899 for since the creation of the world gods invisible qualities his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen being understood from what has been made so that men are without excuse
5918900 furthermore i think people who subscribe to this idea of a scientifically acceptable
5918901 religion certainly has a right to gather knowledge about the world and speak on how the world works for example many of the founders of science were either christian or religious and they maintained that they were gathering information about the world because of their belief in god
5918902 what it comes down to is that only god can convince anyone of his existence

5918915 theres no doubt were in a period of stagflation now
5918916 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5918917 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
5918918 it was decided to address the demand supply issues and improve demand management by targeting inefficiencies in diverse areas of uses
5918919 this will be an exercise which will cover many sectors not confined to petroleum and natural gas alone
5918920 i would urge upon all the officers of the oil companies to ensure that these problems are addressed at the earliest and do not recur
5918921 when the world war broke out it was soon discovered that there were many persons living in various european cities on american passports who had no right to those passports whatsoever
5918922 there were a number of genuine americans residing in his city who had every right and privilege of registering in the consuls foreign office as americans and moreover they had done so but the police records of that city showed a much longer list of selfstyled americans who had never registered
5918923 for reasons not then apparent the department had no enthusiasm in correcting this unfortunate situation
5918924 by this time it was evident that these people would yield to nothing but force so force they should have a third letter was sent to them telling them that in case of further disregard of the invitation the local police would be asked to take up their passports that brought everyone in haste to the consuls office and lo they were all members of the chosen or privileged race the jews
5918925 not many days after this the consul received a call from an elderly individual known as the king of the jews a certain asher ginzberg this elderly individual let it be known that he was very much displeased that the consul had enforced the laws to the inconvenience of the people of his race

5918959 i felt it would have been an insult and extremely unfair to all the students and graduates in the program who regardless of previous credits earned at other institutions were required to complete the vcu 30 credit residency requirement

5918964 i think theres a strong case for the reserve bank to move by a larger amount by 0 5 per cent particularly given that at the beginning of a rate cut cycle its best to have your biggest move because thats when its safest to make the move because thats when rates are at their highest
5918965 i think everyones entirely confident that well see a rate cut on september 2
5918966 i would expect that the prime minister would be applying maximum diplomatic pressure to frank bainimarama to see that elections return to fiji as soon as is possible
5918967 every diplomatic effort needs to be applied by australia new zealand the countries in the south west pacific and indeed throughout the commonwealth to apply pressure to commodore bainimarama to return power in fiji to the fijians themselves

5918971 the bottom line is that our current approach to transportation discourages actively discourages instead of encourages the type of innovative approaches to financing and building like the north transit corridor that houston needs to keep its residents moving
5918972 under our approach communities will no longer have to slice and dice every federal dollar to qualify for niche programs that do little to improve their communities or commutes
5918973 instead projects that make sense for commuters get funded while projects designed only to help politicians wont

5918977 the meeting acceded to their request to discuss the issue of restoration of judges in their respective parties meetings
5918978 the ppp wants us to support it first in legalising the actions of gen retd musharraf while it is not ready to give any timeframe for restoration of the deposed judges
5918979 it ppp sought more time for reinstatement of the judges arguing it was a very complicated issue
5918980 since the deal was first mooted ireland has been to the fore in raising questions and expressing serious concerns particularly about its effects on the international non proliferation regime we are also aware of the importance attached to the deal by india and of the considerable support which exists for it we are currently examining the text of the us proposal the draft decision has clear implications for the npt and non proliferation regime
5918981 it came at 2 02 pm three quarters of an hour into a speech that kept the nation on tenterhooks president musharraf bowed to the inevitable and announced his resignation here at last was the moment the overwhelming majority of the countrys politicians had been hoping for
5918982 most will wonder why it took the president so long some will rue the lost opportunity to impeach him what is incontestable is that the country must move on from this crisis quickly
5918983 theyve done a whole lot of things that violate my constitutional rights

5918994 at first this morning he said he wanted to go to singapore then he changed his mind he is still in the transit area
5918995 we need to control him and he will be controlled once he returns to this country
5918996 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5918997 i want gary glitter to be controlled whilst hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children

5919020 we used to ship two 40 foot containers daily but given the weather conditions we stopped our truck traffic completely on the 25th
5919021 risks to growth also inevitably mean risks to social stability
5919022 on a big scale like this its no longer just about the weather but about the ability of the government to govern
5919023 even if inflation creeps up to 7 5 that grabs the headlines and will affect expectations
5919024 before the snow a week ago it was only 0 59 renminbi
5919025 this government has made competence a cornerstone of their administration even more than their predecessors

5919037 we take care of those immediate days and give them some time to reassess
5919038 if they need a little extra time its not a big deal
5919039 it was terrifying being locked inside and smoke was getting in
5919040 the wind was so terrible there was no time to get anything
5919041 they were surprised that she had been able to survive the fire and been able to walk out
5919042 it is a safe thing to trust him to fulfill the desire which he creates

5919047 for me it is important to be captain but it is important what moment the players are in
5919048 the first eleven will be the best players for me not because they are the captain we have a vice captain rio ferdinand
5919049 sometimes in my career i spoke with the captain but usually i decide
5919050 i prefer that i decide everything always i speak with my staff and ask different questions but the last decision is mine
5919051 i think it is very important to know a lot of players as captains
5919052 you want people to think well of you dont you

5919056 i am also shattered that i cant lead the australian davis cup team in chile in our bid to rejoin the world group and hope that the boys can still come through with a great win
5919057 i am looking forward to playing again in january in my home country and using that as a springboard to compete at my best again on the world stage for at least a couple of more years
5919058 hes done all the training hes had some setbacks but hes an old warhorse so we expect him to come out and train today

5919064 thats slow for a plane that size but its a good safe speed
5919065 i had a feeling they would ask me to do it
5919066 i had discussed it with my dad seven or eight months before coach telling me
5919067 coach sims defensive line coach tom sims said during the 06 season maybe i wanted to think about it thats when it crossed my mind
5919068 i was training to be back on the d line up until the day before spring ball
5919069 ive seen other guys get moved because hey youre too slow to play d line and were going to try you on offensive line
5919070 i saw those guys go over and they werent too happy about it they would end up not doing very well essentially not playing much or not playing at all so i figured i might as well make the best out of it and it worked out pretty well
5919071 for a while i was on my way out the door of the whole program after my knee injury
5919072 things were looking down i thought about leaving coach ron zook told me he had thought about making me leave
5919073 and hes a smart guy wolfy offensive line coach eric wolford and he hit it off he has gained weight and gained strength and taken over a leadership role ryan senior center ryan mcdonald is the cowbell over there but xavier has taken on a leadership role
5919074 and hell be better this year than he was last year
5919075 you dont have to worry about anything coming off the blind side
5919076 he helps me stay relaxed and confident in the pocket
5919077 it helps a lot actually as far as coming off the ball
5919078 it gets your motor going on defense its go go go all the time at least thats how it was with coach sims
5919079 its easier to adapt to a new position and new skills when you have a tremendous athlete
5919080 he has tremendous strength great leverage he has a strong upper body and hes explosive all the things you like to see

5919088 the car rolled up on to its roof there also appears to be a pedestrian on the street that was struck by the car when it came to a rest on a curb
5919089 i cant believe this is really happening she was too young she was only 28 years old she had so much more life to live

5919093 the first object of teaching then is to stimulate in the pupil the love of learning and to form in him the habits and ideals of independent study

5919098 i just have to remember this until after the test
5919099 the lion was returned to the bbc the dramatic story of how the crusade episode one the lion was rescued and loaned to the bbc for copying purposes
5919100 i had spent a great deal of time over the last 12 years researching doctor who screenings on new zealand television we were the first country outside the uk to screen the series and i knew from what myself and other nz researchers had found that most doctor who film prints in nz had either been exported or destroyed many years ago so i didnt hold out much hope of ever finding anything neil lambess had always clung to the belief long before the lion was found that there were missing episodes here he still hasnt given up searching
5919101 director douglas camfield pulled off a considerable coup with this story armed with what he considered to be the finest script he has ever worked with he managed to persuade big name actor julian glover to play the part of king richard i richard the lionheart the grand confrontation between glover as richard and up and coming actress jean marsh as joanna made for one of the finest moments of television drama ever witnessed in doctor who
5919102 david whitakers scripts are brilliant douglas camfields direction immaculate and barry newberys sets superb william hartnell turns in one of his best ever performances as the doctor
5919103 is an example of historically detailed doctor who at its very best with charm wit style and conviction
5919104 it was a surprise yes for a few days it was like what i imagine it must be to be a minor celebrity my phone rang constantly with local and overseas tv stations all wanting an interview and i was on both television news channels here in nz as well as the story appearing on the front page of the newspaper the media attention was remarkable
5919105 it is a remarkable story its survival is a combination of good luck and dedication on the part of the film collectors who originally rescued it from the dump whats worrying however is that until 1999 no one whose hands the film passed through had any awareness that the film was in any way rare or valuable hopefully due to the high media exposure its recovery received film collectors are now aware to look out for doctor who film prints
5919106 its always possible that something will show up but i think the news stories about the lions discovery which circulated the globe probably did more to raise awareness than any bbc orchestrated campaign could have ever done and if there were episodes in private hands its likely wed know about it by now and i dont subscribe to the belief that there are selfish film collectors knowingly hoarding away missing episodes i think thats a fan myth id like to believe that sooner or later human nature would prevail and the owner of any missing material would come forward and allow the bbc to take a copy theres far more prestige in being a generous benefactor than a secretive hoarder
5919107 tvnzs own archives have been thoroughly catalogued and we know from internal records that no missing episodes survive there
5919108 see what they took away my son didnt deserve to have his father taken away
5919109 they have to think before they act to be more cautious
5919110 i know that the situation is difficult but you cant simply shoot at someone
5919111 hundreds possibly thousands of people are shot by police every year in brazil a bbc investigation has found
5919112 said many immigrants are worried that van ness will not be held accountable because martins was an illegal immigrant
5919113 is it a tell of whats going to happen in november not at all
5919114 is there any indication when people step in to cast their ballot that they give this a second thought
5919115 in just two nominees since 1952 has the vice presidential nominee been a governor
5919116 it may be important this time for both candidates obama for his perceived inexperience and for mccain because hes seen as a little too seasoned
5919117 about 40 percent have failed to do it since 1908
5919118 recent non incumbent presidential candidates have received a boost ranging from 3 to 9 points and averaging 5 points this vice presidential bounce is separate from and precedes the usual convention bounce
5919119 its a lot of talk it furthers the story it keeps people interested keeps viewers interested and what else is there to talk about before the convention unless a candidate has a big blunder
5919120 increasing levels of consumer recall interaction and receptivity to mobile advertising reinforce the validity of the mobile marketing medium
5919121 the independence and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders
5919122 demands full and immediate withdrawal of the russian forces to the lines held prior to the outbreak of hostilities
5919123 today what is particularly important is that russia makes good on its commitment to withdraw its forces
5919124 georgia has no immediate army potential anymore so i dont think that there is any reason why russia has to maintain its troops any longer
5919125 we decided to cut to the chase and put this in writing
5919126 the brilliant employees used an instrument located just below the cockpit window that is critical to the operation of the onboard computers
5919127 are now doing things to our aircraft that may put our lives and the lives of our passengers at risk

5919129 china is a country with enormous central power that can expend so much money in a short period of time
5919130 its not possible for any other city to make this kind of expenditure
5919131 i really question whats going to happen to us in the u s especially the chicago bid
5919132 i just dont think we can do the cheap games we used to do or well never get another olympics in retrospect especially the atlanta games seem almost laughable
5919133 theyve done the best job of organizing the largest ever olympic games
5919134 part of that organizational ability is a high level of social control
5919135 beijing is a big city with a lot of people in the streets every time ive been there its just chockablock with people sometimes you can hardly move now we have this image of beijing where there are no people
5919136 clearly people passed all kinds of security checks you see the streets behind tiananmen there is no one there
5919137 i cant imagine why they havent carried it through it makes me just think there wasnt a consensus behind the scenes about how to manage that process
5919138 for the most part those controversies have not overshadowed the spectacle that zhang yimou put together
5919139 i think coming out of the games there will be a modest but discernable uptick in chinas image worldwide but as time goes by the same issues that led to the deterioration in chinas image of the last three or four years darfur tibet human rights job losses overseas these same issues will come back and that uptick will be eroded
5919140 they get used to it beijing has always been spending a lot of other places money on its own development
5919141 i did not say anything about obama or mccain i said whoever is the next president is not going to want to inherit a process that isnt going anywhere
5919142 there was no hesitation on the part of foreign experts to say whats needed is to improve the rule of law including independence of the judiciary there was a little bit of push back from the syrians but there was a debate among the syrians
5919143 none of us thought we were being used or abused
5919144 not only to raise awareness on legal issues but also to assist members of the legal profession in syria in the development of contacts and links with lawyers in other parts of the world
5919145 senator obama values the expertise of ambassador kurtzer but he is not a paid adviser nor is he authorized to conduct talks with any government ambassador kurtzers trip was part of an aba delegation on legal reform and had no connection with the campaign
5919146 the british syrian society is closely connected to the family
5919147 official unofficial syrian intellectuals to come to washington and lobby on behalf of the regime
5919148 but its not a secret that the syrians are openly banking on barack obama its not surprising that they would build bridges in advance and do this through the window of the peace process
5919149 if one of senator obamas advisers has been to damascus we just wonder how many have been to tehran
5919150 thats ridiculous of course no advisers have been to tehran
5919151 what we are going to do today will translate into a billion dollars or more off of next years deficit so i think thats a significant start and i believe its historic i dont think this has ever occurred
5919152 we are getting there we are closing down the loose ends
5919153 in addition to being the right thing to do its now the politically astute thing to do
5919154 if you can crack the republican minority conference in the assembly which is almost exclusively suburban and upstate anti tax republicans newt gingrich anti tax republicans then theres an overwhelming constituency for this its going to happen
5919155 inflict real pain on health care providers health care workers and the new yorkers they serve
5919156 id rather that these cuts were not happening at all
5919157 the ones that are likely to succeed are the ones that already would have succeeded
5919158 it is not particularly surprising that the governors are following the lead of the port authority
5919159 what is disappointing to us is why the port authority hasnt shared why they think there will be a 12 increase in costs why they think there will be a disruption to small community service when all the evidence of basic economics says that prices will go down why would this be different from any other market known to man
5919160 put simply this misguided policy will increase ticket prices for consumers and hurt struggling small market airports while doing nothing to relieve or mitigate delays and congestion at new york and new jersey metropolitan airports
5919161 in a slot auction other airlines those with greater financial resources will reap the benefits of these renovations simply by purchasing a slot
5919162 there is a fundamental disconnect of the economics of what happens when you have an auction
5919163 this is almost a full percentage point higher than where mario cuomo left us
5919164 i looked into his eyes and saw three letters a k a g and a b
5919165 i will send once more a message to those yearning faces beyond our shores that says you matter to us
5919166 we cannot create an anti russia coalition in europe and on this point we are close to putins position this war has pushed georgia further away from europe
5919167 or perhaps companies will want to put wind farms atop our bridges and skyscrapers or use the enormous potential of powerful off shore winds miles out in the atlantic ocean where turbines could generate roughly twice the energy that land based wind farms can
5919168 wind farms located far off our shores some evidence shows could meet 10 of our citys electricity needs within a decade
5919169 im not that great but im not the worst either

5919178 the removal of dann appeared to be carried out in a rash and reckless manner containing little concern about the rights of over 2 million ohioans who voted for dann the requirements of the laws and basic principles of fairness
5919179 instead the process was apparently driven by strong concerns about the condition of one political partys house
5919180 removal standards that are inconsistent with the impeachment standard contained in the ohio constitution
5919181 who had publicly and repeatedly called for dann to resign or be impeached
5919182 in a manner that crippled danns ability to continue to function as attorney general

5919204 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5919205 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5919206 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5919207 barack obama has made it clear that unconditional withdrawal in iraq is more important to him than victory in iraq thats not a criticism of his patriotism thats a criticism of his judgment
5919208 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed

5919223 it was a good finish from fernando i was just behind the shot and i could see exactly where it was going it was a great strike and it gave the keeper no chance
5919224 none of us were surprised that fernando scored in that way because we have seen him do it before in games and he also does it in training
5919225 it is great for us that we have that kind of player in our team and he is right back in the groove

5919244 all told 45 persons in the u s were identified then in 1957 as having fortunes over 100 million in the decade since the centimillionaire population has more than tripled and tose with 150 million or more has grown to 66
5919245 theres a big part of america that really believes that there is a war on terrorism and that we need to finish up
5919246 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq he came back and said some really nice things
5919247 so as far as leadership and patriotism goes i think its really important that those things have to take place and i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton and thats coming from a democrat

5919249 kendra wilkinson has been offered her own reality show about starting her life over again when she moves out of the playboy mansion hugh hefner knows her time is coming
5919250 i recognized that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
5919251 i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
5919252 didnt win the battles but they did isolate france in the world and they made de gaulle realise that he had to give up algeria if france was ever to be a great power again
5919253 i realised that it wasnt enough just to study relations between states that international and even non government organisations could be increasingly important so i wanted to study something where the united nations and ngos would be front and centre from the word go
5919254 i wanted to figure out how even at the height of the cold war 50 years ago whether were looking at the spread of transnational jihadist movements or the increasing importance of the international media or the way the un becomes a battleground you could see a lot of the things that people associate with the post cold war world already up and running
5919255 we live in a world where people count other people as a way to understand political change in countries like france islam is already the second largest religion whats that going to mean is france going to be france in the future when the population of france changes so profoundly
5919256 but when having a national identity and having citzenship came instead with a whole set of rights and privileges like receiving social security and free medical care and all the rest it became important to count people not just as people but as citizens and also to begin to exclude certain people who were thought unworthy or incapable of being citizens
5919257 even in prussia in the 1880s people were crossing the border relatively freely in fact the united states was a pioneer in tracking movement across borders and beginning to exclude certain kinds of people from citizenship the first laws to ban asian immigration in the us started in the 1870s
5919258 over time this became a global trend as you would know from australian history australia south africa canada and eventually several states in latin america began to exclude chinese immigrants and the idea was that if you allowed in these people which seemed lesser people and your own citizens had to compete with them for lower wages there would be a race to the bottom where the chinese people who could live on less and reproduce more would come to outnumber everyone else so that was the idea behind what became a world wide movement to contain asians within their own continent
5919259 the eugenicists were prominent among the members of the early immigration control movements especially in the us they tried to export their ideas worldwide they found many people who were willing to work with them you will find there were eugenics movements across south america in india china in japan they werent all the same but there were commonalities among people who believed it would be possible to breed better people
5919260 populations are always out of control if you want to control fertility for instance the only way you can do that with any certainty or predictability is through coercion as china did with the one child policy
5919261 by the end of the 19th century there was a neo malthusian league that had branches across europe these were relatively small organisations but over time some women people like margaret sanger in the us began to think that providing contraception to women would be a way to empower them to give them control over their lives
5919262 signed up in a sense for a whole agenda of not just giving women contraception but also making sure that those who were unfit would be prevented from having children
5919263 typically it was women on public assistance or women who were in institutions but in some cases women who were considered to be anti social women who were of loose morals who on a doctors order or by the ruling of a judge would be subject to compulsory sterilisation
5919264 what us supreme court justice oliver wendell holmes said was that just as the state can order compulsory immunisation so too can it order compulsory sterilisation he was actually talking about a family the woman in questions name was carrie buck based on the evidence presented to the court he believed this was a family of imbeciles in fact generations of imbeciles
5919265 well it turned out that they were nothing of the kind at the time people had a very vague sense of what they called feeble mindedness and all sorts of people including carrie buck were swept up people who typically didnt have money or education were sterilised sometimes with no notion of what was happening to them in some cases they were told they were getting an appendectomy so the us pioneered not just control of migration and exclusion of asian immigrants but also the compulsory sterilisation of their own citizens and thats something that became common in many countries across scandanavia in japan and most notoriously in nazi germany
5919266 you know the evidence is that these kinds of programs only have a very marginal impact on the fertility rate if governments want to make it easier for parents to have kids they should do it because its good policy rather than cash most parents would rather have decent maternity and paternity leave and especially access to decent day care and child care options those are the kinds of policies that i think actually do make a difference for parents
5919267 what im afraid of if not in australia then in other countries is that when these kinds of policies dont work as they have not worked in the past that governments will try more coercive policies
5919268 the nazis tried this and so did mussolinis italy stalins ussr and vichy france all of them tried to increase fertility rates by withdrawing access to contraception in france even in the 1920s it was illegal to even advocate use of birth control and under vichy women who performed abortions were sent to the guillotine
5919269 what happens when you try to increase fertility rates by withdrawing contraception and access to abortion
5919270 a lot of people die because women in desperate circumstances will get abortions illegally and they will often get unsafe abortions a more recent example is romania under ceau escu where the maternal mortality rate soared when they withdrew access to abortion
5919271 thats why im arguing that if were going to provide access to contraception which we should and if were going to provide access to safe and legal abortion and if were also going to provide access to infertility treatment so parents can have help in having children if they want and need it we should do it because its the right thing to do from a moral point of view not because we think its going to raise or reduce infertility rates

5919281 it is an image of a white man of middle age
5919282 the process is better served with a broad range of perspectives
5919283 it is that they are not mature enough nor have had life experience to guide them through difficult issues and decisions i have seen some of these people in action and i can see that they are very smart but lacking in the decision making process

5919301 for the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard 2 after agreeing with the laborers for a denarius a day he sent them into his vineyard 3 and going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the market place 4 and to them he said you go into the vineyard too and whatever is right i will give you so they went 5 going out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour he did the same 6 and about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing and he said to them why do you stand here idle all day 7 they said to him because no one has hired us he said to them you go into the vineyard too 8 and when evening came the owner of the vineyard said to his steward call the laborers and pay them their wages beginning with the last up to the first 9 and when those hired about the eleventh hour came each of them received a denarius 10 now when the first came they thought they would receive more but each of them also received a denarius 11 and on receiving it they grumbled at the householder 12 saying these last worked only one hour and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat 13 but he replied to one of them friend i am doing you no wrong did you not agree with me for a denarius 14 take what belongs to you and go i choose to give to this last as i give to you 15 am i not allowed to do what i choose with what belongs to me or do you begrudge my generosity 16 so the last will be first and the first last

5919323 many of us often question ourselves why is there so much spam the answer is because enough people are purchasing products from spam to make it a worthwhile for spammers
5919324 spam is commonly believed to attract very low response rates estimates indicate there is often less than ten purchases made for every million spam messages sent but most of these messages are blocked by spam filters
5919325 this means the actual response rates are much higher if you only count those emails that make it into a persons inbox

5919362 but i guess once you injure your take off ankle you really dont have anything to do
5919363 no this is the first time that i hurt it its not a strain or twist but i hurt the joint and just could not take off and it only aggravated when the qualifying round started i could neither run nor take off gt

5919386 podr a no considerarse que realmente es tierra en este momento
5919387 la mayor parte del da o se limit a una fuerte lluvia
5919388 calles inundadas postes de electricidad derribados y rboles ca dos ese tipo de cosas
5919389 permit the children to come to me and do not hinder them for the kingdom of god belongs to such as these
5919390 truly i say to you whoever does not receive the kingdom of god like a child will not enter it at all

5919396 coaching is a profession of love you cannot coach people unless you love them
5919397 podemos fue s lo una caricatura de partido pol tico para las elecciones y tard m s erigirse que en derrumbarse porque no tuvo la magnitud de capitalizar el apoyo que recibi en las elecciones y ahora tuto quiroga representa s lo al embajador de norteam rica en bolivia
5919398 the single most important thing you can do in businesses is be yourself
5919399 i felt there was a real danger here that you would get bogged down in a long drawn out conflict that this was a dangerous difficult part of the world
5919400 children and dogs are as necessary to the welfare of the country as wall street and the railroads
5919401 i think surprising myself then has sort of shown me that i always have to expect the highest level from myself
5919402 now that im here i see what a big deal this is
5919403 its just like any other race only its not at all like any other race
5919404 its been really interesting watching the games from korea because you see a whole different side they show all the sports theyre good at its been pretty surreal kind of weird
5919405 it sort of hit me going through security to get into the olympic village and getting the accreditation and everything its like whoa were really here
5919406 my fitness was really good my confidence was really good and then i had to settle for getting top 15s at world cups it was kind of a bummer of all the years it had to happen it had to happen this year but finally now i feel like im back to my normal self back to feeling 100 percent now
5919407 its confidence its skills a little bit of luck a lot of luck all of that coming together for one day nobody would say im a contender a heavy hitter but im not daunted by that at all i know i have the potential all i can do is the best i have on any given day and im prepared to do that
5919408 whether i allow hits or i allow walks i always think that the important thing is not to allow the runners to score
5919409 thats the way i thought last year and its still the same this year
5919410 he finds a way to win thats all you can ask from a starting pitcher
5919411 hes not giving in and we know that sometimes its frustrating but it keeps you on your toes
5919412 i havent had results but ive been swinging the bat over the past two weeks three weeks
5919413 because i hit a homer doesnt make the difference but i think all that other stuff was just compiling ive returned more to normal since the all star break than i was before that
5919414 i was just trying to go up there and throw strikes they take a lot of pitches maybe thats why theyre so good
5919415 we had some opportunities and matsuzaka made some big pitches and got out of them
5919416 but we hung in there the best we could when your teams playing good everything seems to go your way and when its not going your way it seems like guys out in the field got extra gloves on
5919417 we had the right guys up there and it didnt happen
5919418 now that you said it i think someones going to get that hit
5919419 it doesnt matter whether the bases are loaded or not my job is to not allow the runners to score if theres a base empty of course its a little easier but its not something i worry about
5919420 now that the president is out of the picture there can be no more dilly dallying
5919421 but the legislature is a collection of competing political forces that for most of their history have engaged in zero sum games
5919422 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5919423 right now there are russian soldiers and tanks at poti
5919424 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5919425 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5919426 he former president chiluba was very saddened by the news that the country had lost president mwanawasa to the stroke although president mwanawasa has been unwell since june 29 we were hopeful and prayerful that he will fight the effects of this stroke and pull through so he was very saddened that president mwanawasa died and he has expressed his condolences to the acting president his excellency mr rupiah banda and he has wished his deepest sympathy to the first family to the government to the mmd and to the country at large
5919427 they had a very longstanding relationship that dates back to their days in ndola a town on the copper belt they worked together he chiluba was in the trade union and president mwanawasa was a lawyer and he was consulted several times in those early days at the dawn of democracy in 1990 they forged a friendship for the service of this country president chiluba was president and mr mwanawasa was his vice in the party and when president chiluba won elections in 1991 he invited mwanawasa to be his vice and mr mwanawasa was the vice president of the republic so they have a very strong longstanding relationship
5919428 even when president mwanawasa resigned as vice president and after so many years and even when president chilubas terms came to an end he still went to president mwanawasa and called upon him to be his successor he chiluba campaigned for him and president mwanawasa assumed office in 2002
5919429 people expect to be checked when they enter the country and for the government to determine if theyre admissible or not
5919430 what they dont expect is for the government to keep a record for 15 years of their comings into the country
5919431 history has shown whether you are talking about criminal or terrorist activity that plotting planning or even relationships among conspirators can go on for years
5919432 basic travel records can quite literally help frontline officers to connect the dots
5919433 this database is in a sense worse than a watch list
5919434 at least in the watch list scenario theres some reason why the name got on the list here the only thing a person does to come to the attention of dhs is to lawfully cross the border the theory of this data collection is track everyone just in case
5919435 so i have a job to do a job to complete in that sense yes i would like to run
5919436 i have begun a task to rebuild afghanistan into a peaceful prosperous country into a democratic country a country where the afghan people will have a voice and their rights respected a country that will be producing on its own and living off its own means
5919437 the afghan people still suffer massively in the war against terrorism and in the war for stability in afghanistan
5919438 the reason we are still around is because of the immense resilience of the afghan people and their goodheartedness toward the presence of the international community
5919439 other than that activities like breaking into homes would have gotten us into serious trouble a long time back
5919440 the preparations for the swearing in of members of the seventh parliament since independence are at an advanced stage
5919441 there was little food left in our house it is good they have called off protests for sometime
5919442 especially if government could continue showing that it could respond appropriately and within the limits of law and order
5919443 the impact on business and trading cannot be immediately measured but i think theres not much impact because the fighting was fairly recent
5919444 is responding quite well and i think there should be no need for businessmen in areas near the conflict to arm themselves
5919445 so far our members have not reported any abrupt changes in their trading activities and none of our suppliers and partners outside mindanao have called us to inquire on the situation
5919446 business have wanted to be clarified on these incidents and when the milf has told government that it has no control over these rogue groups i believe the government has treated these incidents as terroristic and mere banditry and therefore responding to them within the legal limits
5919447 that at situations like this no one can prevent them from arming themselves to protect their communities
5919448 to put up now proactive programs to prevent these kinds of occurrences that disturb the routine activities in mindanao
5919449 these may be expensive though and require more massive cooperation from both the armed forces and the police and the civilians and that includes us businessmen
5919450 strict frisking of people at checkpoints aggressive aerial and land surveillance to detect movements of armed men
5919451 not to resort to all out offensives in central and northern mindanao in response to alleged milf attacks
5919452 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5919453 sensitivity to this belief will promote development of a trusting relationship
5919454 when youre a parent and youre standing over the body of your child who you think is dying you have to have that
5919455 i know that none of us are immune from anything
5919456 you cant say thats nonsense you have to respect that
5919457 its not that you dont want a miracle to happen its just that is not going to happen today with this patient
5919458 the mom was playing religious tapes in the room and obviously was very focused on looking for a miracle
5919459 caught her in the side of the head she had no pulse when they pulled her out of the water
5919460 we just cant shut that machine off then you know what we cant shut that machine off
5919461 you might have a family thats having a hard time and it might take another day and thats ok
5919462 if you can go quietly negative thats what hes done i think the perception is that hes still running the positive campaign
5919463 its a pretty smart high low good cop bad cop strategy
5919464 that figure 20 million included provision for road works drainage power water supply pavements walkways car parks street lights civic amenities and reconstruction of the yoganup playground as well as like for like sporting facilities
5919465 the request from busselton council to obtain an increase in a state government contribution required a revision of figures the figure of 16 75 million is a capped figure for like for like sporting facilities and associated land acquisition only unlike the previous figure which included public works on the foreshore
5919466 in early july the minister for the south west mark mcgowan visited busselton and the shire president informed us that a report would soon come to council
5919467 its geared towards getting sailors properly checked in as quickly as possible
5919468 each department especially those that gained sailors played a huge role in making this successful
5919469 however our admin department plays the lead sailors have to come through us to ensure that all their paperwork is in line and to get them entered into the ships administrative system
5919470 you have so many moving pieces that need to fit together just for one single event
5919471 you could compare it to planning a concert you have to book the band print the tickets rent a venue and set up chairs there are a lot of different things to plan for
5919472 it was definitely a good learning experience for us we were able to take some information and use it toward this actual cross deck there were lessons learned and we got a very good idea of how to make this bigger transition run smoother
5919473 some of those attacked required medical or veterinarian treatment one severe attack on a pet dog by two other dogs resulted in death
5919474 all dogs are potentially prone to attack at some stage especially if they are out wandering and not under the control of their owner
5919475 some dogs become territorial over the location they are at every time they come across another dog
5919476 having good control of your dog is worthwhile in the event of a dog attack the maximum penalty can be up to 10 000 twelve months imprisonment or both
5919477 signing up to do a mile for sport relief is such an easy thing to do
5919478 and its great timing this year after the post christmas excesses
5919479 whether youre young or old fit or unfit most people can do a mile in one way or another and help poor and vulnerable people in the process
5919480 i guess i got on to council because i was involved with the community
5919481 i had no idea what was involved i thought it was two meetings a fortnight and then i got on and realised that wasnt so
5919482 but i just enjoy it i have learnt so much its incredible
5919483 i stay home and do the washing and the house work unless im going car racing
5919484 ive got my health ive got the time and ive got the energy and enthusiasm
5919485 at the moment im pretty excited about the way the town is moving forward
5919486 what has been really good i think is the way the community has come out
5919487 i am very surprised the nationals didnt preselect someone for the seat considering they are chasing a spot in the upper house
5919488 with no paul omodei running no bernie masters running and no prominent labor member running it looks like troy buswell is going to win comfortably
5919489 he is clearly going to be the prominent name which everyone will recognise
5919490 my feedback is that troy is still polling well in his electorate
5919491 a blatant disregard of the council as he has gone full steam ahead with his personal views
5919492 ratepayers should have every right to be demanding a reimbursement from him personally for the blatant misuse of their funds
5919493 i have publicly stated that i will ask him and i intend to
5919494 i do however stand by my belief that until we get a cohesive council and that is one where the shire president includes the councillors in his her decision making process the community will have no faith in us
5919495 the council can resolve to do certain things but an individual councillor cant call upon anybody else to do anything
5919496 i have remained alert to the issues occurring at the council since my absence and offer the following input for the record
5919497 i wish i had been convincing to my fellow councillors to not get the government of the day involved in the jetty reconstruction and unless we the shire retake control we will never see the full potential of the busselton jetty as it should be and as it could be
5919498 it was always going to add significant delays once the government became involved
5919499 it is ironic that one of the communitys best assets along with the land around it has been given away what were we thinking
5919500 whether you call it an administration building or civic precinct building you can try to hype the name in many ways but do we really need to put the shire into this kind of debt it is my opinion that we do not
5919501 the building we are currently in can be upgraded to solve our needs of today and into the future let us put a real plan together one created out of needs not wants
5919502 swapping shire assets land for significant liabilities i e a new administration building is not economically viable for such a small population base and it loads up future rates for inadequate ratepayer value
5919503 it is not community minded of the shire council to increase rates substantially for a project that will benefit only a small few the excitement of a new administration building will wear off and our children will be left with a debt that will take decades to pay
5919504 having put those opinions on the public record i make the point that i am acutely aware of my responsibilities in the matter of my long term absence from the council i offer the following comments
5919505 i still have a great sense of commitment to the shire and to all of the current projects but it is obvious to me and no doubt to you all that i cannot be of assistance with or properly debate the decision making whilst i am away
5919506 i therefore with great regret formally notify you all of my resignation as deputy shire president and councillor of the busselton shire effective forthwith
5919507 i thank the community for all of its support and this was huge especially in some of the tougher moments when the ccc and media were having their merry and publicly harmful way with the reputations of several councillors
5919508 it will be the beginning of the end of her campaign
5919509 dozens of people from the shia community had gathered at the hospital where the bomb went off
5919510 what we are seeing is no change in the pakistan government policies after musharraf
5919511 we want the government to change its policies this is not a sectarian attack we take its responsibility
5919512 of course there was a great symbolism to them doing this at the senaki base
5919513 in their eyes senaki was a bit of nato that they just dont want to see in georgia
5919514 the buildings the arms all gone if you consider that this is one of the few such modern bases we have this was very important for us
5919515 nothing about us needing to explain to someone why where to and for how long the black sea fleet ships are leaving their walls
5919516 without a doubt there wont be any mine fences or military collisions one shouldnt even talk about that
5919517 i think that russia is looking for a reason to have a serious conflict with ukraine

5919530 its really hard people are eating whatever they can find
5919531 we hadnt had rain for the last eight months we had to buy water to save our lives but now we have nothing
5919532 it is very surprising and very strange because everything is so green but food stocks at household level are empty or close to empty
5919533 we havent seen such high rates of acute malnutrition of above 20 per cent in as many places as were seeing right now since 2000
5919534 we are just eating anything we find on the ground i am hungry and i feel really sick we dont have any food to eat
5919535 shhh not save here so many insert racial group s
5919536 when its hot i would go to the park at 11 p m at night to water the garden
5919537 so i would overhear a lot it was mostly young men and some young women i heard someone refer to it as manhunt and it appears to involve running hiding shrieking and finding
5919538 at first i took it with a grain of salt
5919539 i can empathize that this is fun running around in the dark but it really has seemed to escalate with the participants being more and more disinhibited
5919540 one of the frustrating things is that when a problem is brought to the attention of the city by either a citizen or a citizens group theres no way to follow through or be part of the solution to the problem
5919541 i dont know if we could help head off some of this vandalism but i think i would feel a little better if i had some response acknowledging that there is a problem and some sort of inclusion about how we deal with this problem
5919542 i have not been aware of the vandalism and ive been on the board for 8 1 2 years
5919543 im meeting with parks and recreation deputy commissioner bob derubeis to look over whats happening
5919544 i am a realist and at this point id probably have to say its dead in the water
5919545 we can debate the issue right or wrong everyone has an opinion on it
5919546 it deserves debate it deserves the will of the people
5919547 there are a number of default applications like nokia maps currently free but i think that is because of the trial and other gps utilities including a positioning system that would be great for geocaching
5919548 every man wherever he goes is encompassed by a cloud of comforting convictions which move with him like flies on a summer day

5919560 they want greg normans and fred couples and tiger woods they dont want guys youve never heard of
5919561 its supposed to be a human sport yet theres equestrians going on there i think golf would be a great thing for the olympics
5919562 watching some of the opening ceremony it got me thinking how amazing it would be to represent your country at the olympic games
5919563 how good must that feel i mean seeing the looks on the faces of guys like tennis stars rafael nadal and roger federer you could see what it meant to them
5919564 i really hope im still around if and when golf is introduced
5919565 i know some critics say that the olympic games are for amateurs and that golf shouldnt be included but thats a pretty thin argument
5919566 american basketball star kobe bryant is there and what does he earn maybe 40 million a year last time i checked nadal and federer werent exactly playing for peanuts either
5919567 and besides all the top runners earn big money now so if money and amateur status are the only arguments against getting golf in the olympics well like i say there is no argument
5919568 they could have a mens and womens golf event and maybe take the two top players off the world rankings
5919569 having golf as an olympic sport is exponentially more important to the game of golf than the majors
5919570 i have no doubt that olympic golf is comfortably the biggest grow the game opportunity that exists to help us bring golf to so many countries where its just starting up
5919571 its been made very clear to us on several occasions by the ioc that if golf is to be in the olympics then it has to be for the top players in the world
5919572 golf will not get into the olympics if its to be for amateurs
5919573 this will not be plain sailing we have much work ahead of us there is stiff competition
5919574 where the game is 10 15 20 25 years from now could be fundamentally different because of the step were taking and the short term issues will pale in comparison
5919575 all of us are in the business of televised golf so the olympic schedule affects us already
5919576 we played for example the presidents cup in late october a few years ago when the games were in sydney because nbc was in sydney
5919577 we have to come up with a formula which attracts the leading players of the world also allows players from a wide variety of countries to compete and also recognizes the iocs policy on a limitation on athlete numbers
5919578 we did go to visit the ioc in lausanne recently and i think it was made pretty clear to us at that meeting that a bid from golf would be warmly welcomed by the ioc
5919579 i dont know whether i have done enough yet to get into the team i hope so but i might not have
5919580 the us and india are certainly using strong arms tactics but reports that a decision on the proposal could occur this week dont appear to match with the reality that many states of the 45 member nsg group still have significant concerns
5919581 the us germany and india are privately acknowledging that a second or third meeting will likely be convened sometime in september on the issue and that changes to the us august 6 proposed text will be necessary to achieve nsg consensus
5919582 perhaps in recognition of many difficulties the proposal faces in the nsg germany has reportedly invited india to present its case and answer questions from nsg countries at this weeks meeting

5919812 i will once again put our royalties for regions plan on the table and well see if colin barnett walks away from the meeting again
5919813 the liberal party is in bed with the big end of town and the labor party has completely lost the plot
5919814 west australians are pretty smart they know the two major parties arent giving them a fair go i expect a higher vote for minor parties at the election
5919815 i couldnt believe it i thought i would be here forever
5919816 its like we lost a family member we have been coming here for over two decades we eat out regularly we have choices all over the county and this is one of the three top choices for us
5919817 now i dont give a if dude won medals swimming wow you can swim fast im so impressed hey how about throwing a football 30 yards with pinpoint accuracy while you got 5 guys running right at you yeah thats talent i was swimming when i was 2 the should i be impressed by some swimmer
5919818 you cant do better than joe biden for vice president
5919819 he appeals to the kind of swing voters in florida you have to have to win here because of his gravitas
5919820 also america is no longer a place where citizens care about plagiarism or hair plugs a biden pick would immediately elevate obamas gravitas give him a semblance of humility delight the media and reassure the nation that a grownup is involved democrats would be simultaneously relieved and apprehensive but theyd be pleased with the choice overall plus biden is catholic is a washington insider in a good way a hardworking man of the people unchanged by three decades inside the beltway and has a tragic history with a happy ending
5919821 ho perso 4 giorni per una stronzata mannaggia a lui ma anche di questo mi importa il giusto
5919822 in dankbarer erinnerung dieses r hmlichen benehmens haben wir wilhelm von gottes gnaden deutscher kaiser k nig von preu en die aufstellung dieses denkmals zu bleibender erinnerung angeordnet
5919823 people could enjoy with their families a pleasant day in the sun and surf
5919824 we are probably the ones that will have to cover the cost of mr mcgintys smoking police i cant imagine him setting up a special police force to enforce it
5919825 we used to handle roads rates and rubbish and now we are doing lots of things the state government used to do
5919826 i do support it because i think that rather than individual councils having the responsibility so you dont know what the situation is between say leederville and fremantle its consistent for people
5919827 you cant have officers walking up and down cappuccino strips and policing it we havent got the resources to add to staff to police these things
5919828 what you have to do is ban it and hope that people respect it and that owners of businesses have a mind to respect it
5919829 we are doing lots of things the state government used to do
5919830 it seems to me craziness when we have got 83 000 aboriginal people sitting in the job network system without a job
5919831 it is not rocket science here we could move aboriginal people across into these jobs
5919832 initially when you hear the announcement from the government you think are they taking positions that might be for local young people or local indigenous people but in all reality thats not the case on the ground
5919833 its fair to say the indigenous community is looking for education and training and long term permanent employment opportunities theyre not necessarily attracted to the horticultural industry picking the fruit those labour intensive entry level jobs
5919834 i dont think its going to cause any conflict with a new group coming in there are a lot of jobs in horticulture that go unfilled
5919835 koori kids are often interested in horticulture but with fruit picking work for a start it is seasonal so what are you going to do when the season ends as well there is no real scope for advancement or to learn new skills
5919836 requirements that we will put in place will ensure that if there is an australian or someone based in australia who is ready willing and able to work in the horticulture industry then theyll get the jobs first
5919837 im sorry my hands are full of this 22 so im gonna need you to call in your own impending arrest

5919840 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
5919841 i said you know what you can inflate your tires to the proper levels and that if everybody in america inflated their tires to the proper level we would actually probably save more oil than all the oil wed get from john mccain drilling right below his feet there or wherever he was going to drill

5919867 nbc olympics on the go delivers large video files it may use a lot of bandwidth it is not recommended for people using dial up or metered broadband accounts
5919868 when they show they are blocking access to some sort of content they have the burden to show that what they are doing is reasonable
5919869 recognizing that the web is richer and more bandwidth intensive than it has been historically we are pleased that comcast wants to collaborate with us to migrate to techniques that the internet community will find to be more transparent

5919889 on the whole the broad med tech market continues to show solid growth particularly when compared to other segments of the economy
5919890 we think the market is stable and kind of growing in the range we indicated before
5919891 although medtronics fiscal first quarter is generally the weakest of the year medtronic reported a strong quarter of earnings per share outperformance largely driven by the highest gross margins the company has delivered since mid fiscal first quarter 2005

5919896 las nuevas acusaciones emitidas hoy por un gran jurado en contra del gobernador acevedo vil son un nuevo ejemplo de una fiscal a federal que no cesa de jugar a la pol tica y que pretende usar los recursos legales que tiene a su disposici n para hacer da o pol tico y a la vez darle aire a la candidatura de luis fortu o que no hay duda que cada d a se desinfla m s y m s
5919897 el pueblo puertorrique o se merece mucho m s de lo que est pasando est claro que an bal acevedo vil dirigi este esquema de corrupci n en ocasiones desde fortaleza yo espero que l entienda el da o que est haciendo a puerto rico y si l no lo entiende que esos miembros de la junta de gobierno del partido popular lo entiendan y le exijan que renuncie a la gobernaci n ya
5919898 el est muy bien el gobernador contin a con su agenda ma ana hoy ninguna actividad se cancela de la misma manera que no se cancel ninguna actividad los dos d as posteriores a las acusaciones del 27 de marzo el gobernador ustedes lo saben muy bien ha mantenido su calendario de trabajo
5919899 esta es la respuesta de fiscal a a la moci n de desestimaci n que present la defensa del gobernador yo no creo en coincidencias ni casualidades creo que todo el mundo en puerto rico sabe que esto es un caso con motivaciones pol ticas
5919900 aqu no hay nada nuevo son unas acusaciones adicionales a las que ya tiene el gobernador y se van a procesar en el tribunal que el gobernador siempre ha defendido en puerto rico el tribunal federal este es uno de los roles del tribunal federal en la colonia el rol de investigar y de procesar a todo el que quiera
5919901 a nosotros nos parece que la acusaci n en la tarde de hoy es la respuesta de fiscal a federal a la contestaci n del gobernador esto es como reempaquetar el caso original esto obedece a que el caso contra el gobernador es d bil y que se han dado cuenta de que luis fortu o no est bien en las encuestas
5919902 las acusaciones no deben sorprender a nadie porque el d a que se hicieron las primeras acusaciones en marzo la fiscal a federal dijo que vendr an m s tampoco debe sorprender que estas nuevas acusaciones se hagan a 77 d as de las elecciones
5919903 eso es bien lamentable el pueblo de puerto rico est bien triste con todo esto que est pasando y nosotros lo que debemos hacer es aprender de esto si no nos alejamos de una cultura pol tica que se fundamenta en dinero en apariencia y en publicidad este tipo de cosas van a seguir pasando
5919904 forget what the mags with the shirtless six packed dudes on the cover tell you fitness is not about 20 inch guns and 10 minute full body workouts nor is it about miracle diets or flashy sponsorships and its certainly not about looking good at the gym fitness is about living at your peak no matter what stands in your way its about obeying the alarm clock peeling yourself out of bed and finding that extra hour most people think theyll never have and since its never been easier to connect to coaches network with training partners and find cutting edge advice and gear online the only thing standing between you and the podium is committment

5919948 when i learned the symbol of the islamic faith will appear on coca cola packaging during ramadan 2008 i found myself wondering whether or not the atlanta based soft drink maker will soon include the christian cross and jewish star of david in future holiday packaging designs targeting people of those faiths
5919949 in a globalizing world ramadan presents an opportunity to showcase the true values of islam and what it stands for
5919950 because no other brand is as inclusive as and no other company is as diverse as coca cola we have a unique opportunity to play a valued role as an international bridge builder and facilitator of dialogue during ramadan
5919951 in addition to the focus on ramadan and eid the coca cola system has also implemented policies and programs to meet the needs of muslim employees such as providing halal food in cafeterias and organizing special prayer rooms at company facilities
