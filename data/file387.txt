3870009 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3870010 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3870011 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3870012 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3870013 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3870014 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3870015 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3870016 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3870017 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3870018 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3870019 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3870020 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3870021 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
3870022 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3870023 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3870024 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
3870025 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
3870026 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3870027 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3870028 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3870029 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3870030 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3870031 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3870032 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3870033 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3870034 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3870035 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3870036 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks

3870041 im personally very happy and i hope ive made the chelsea fans happy
3870042 ive had seven great seasons here and now i can have many more
3870043 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of the frustrating things a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating
3870044 now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
3870045 my world got turned upside down and i dont think it is anything anyone appreciates until you go through it
3870046 i feel for sure ive made 100 percent the right decision for myself for my family and for chelsea football club
3870047 these are big issues for the club for frank and any other player
3870048 whatever has gone on i think there is that underlying desire that we get there its taken both frank and the club longer than we originally thought
3870049 its very difficult to fill the space not only because of his contributions with the bat and ball but also because of his impact in the dressing room
3870050 we are not doing too badly its just we are losing the key games
3870051 we shouldnt be too high or too low in confidence well try to keep a positive frame of mind
3870052 we just need to make sure that we get our game plans right
3870053 the demand is bad so why store a product that youre going to have trouble selling
3870054 weve got a good sized rally but it still doesnt feel like its sustainable were not seeing the frenzy of buying that we would have seen a couple months ago
3870055 i think the true underlying demand weakness is still out there

3870113 i started playing in clubs in new york city at the gaslight cafe the bitter end maxs kansas city and then had the good fortune to go on and play the other venues in this city
3870114 weve started conversations about it and i think in the next 30 or 60 days well be able to talk completely about that
3870115 shes totally static as a sculptor i dont like that i like to change her
3870116 they start altering her and it becomes much more thoughtful it becomes much more personal and identity oriented

3870120 there is now far too much on the table particularly for developing countries to give up on these negotiations
3870121 this is trying to rewrite history this serves as the benchmark to resume negotiations
3870122 a fine balance is required and the search for this fine balance requires that our negotiating resources continue at work
3870123 i was shocked and saddened to hear about the tragedy in arkansas were all grateful for the quick action of law enforcement and quick thinking by chairman gwatneys staff and michelle and i are keeping him and his family in our prayers
3870124 we are stunned and shaken by todays shooting at the arkansas democratic party where our good friend and fellow democrat bill gwatney was critically wounded bill is not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but he is also a cherished friend and confidante our thoughts and prayers are with bill and his family today and we wish him a quick recovery
3870125 this senseless tragedy comes as a shock to all of us our thoughts and prayers go out to chairman gwatney and his family and we pray for his full and speedy recovery while the investigation of this shooting continues and our primary concern remains with bill and his family we commend the courageous and speedy action of law enforcement officials in apprehending the suspect
3870126 i am absolutely shocked and dismayed i was just with bill monday in fort smith and as always he was bright and positive about the future of arkansas and this country in a horrific circumstance such as this my immediate response is to pray my prayers are with bill and his family
3870127 we let her stay here and now shes blaming everything on us
3870128 they smile at you while they dig a grave for you behind your back

3870130 at least we wouldnt have been able to come back to the
3870131 it was supposed to be a picture that inspired the olympic spirit
3870132 the simple question is would stern and the league hold the american players accountable and i think the answer to that is yes
3870133 so why wouldnt he hold the other nba players accountable unless the rules only apply to the american players
3870134 we could say that too but at the end of day we are still representing the nba
3870135 no matter if were saying the actions have nothing to do with it at the end of day we have to go back home and our jobs are there
3870136 it would start an international riot if we did it but they arent us
3870137 its low rent stuff but fiba wont do squat so the nba would show them up with any punitive action i would be shocked if the nba does any more than condemn the action

3870142 it seems like a lot of music today is so churned out and simple i like playing these festivals because its one thing all day and then here i come on and everyones like whoa then back to the grind
3870143 it sounds like a banjo but they sing with it and its the most fucking passionate emotional music ive ever heard in my life
3870144 i want to include that in my album because its so passionate like when you hear a korn song and its really going crazy these guys do it with a stringy banjo i want to bring that to kids here who are like what the fuck is this and open their minds up to something different

3870171 tomorrows date is 08 08 08 a number on the calendar that we will never see again in our lifetimes
3870172 according to almost every numerological tradition including feng shui the number 8 has almost exclusively to do with money abundance more money the ability to receive a lot of money and well money
3870173 in the orient businessmen have been known to actually pay millions of dollars in order to have that same digit on their license plates or incorporated in some way into the name of their companies or the address of same etc
3870174 for that one reason alone did the chinese fight so hard to host this years olympic games on this particular and specific date starting at 8 08 08 p m
3870175 anytime tomorrow take a piece of red paper and with any writing instrument that has gold ink draw the infinity symbol an 8 on its side in the center of the red paper
3870176 put a bank of some sort a piggybank a jar with coins in it a small silver box with money in it in the wealth area of your house far back left hand corner of the main floor as you stand at your front door looking in and put this red paper symbol into that bank
3870177 this is an olympic sized opportunity to bring big wealth your way go for the gold youre already a winner
3870178 there had been much talk in the last few months about the impending triple eight date would the crop circles respond to or reflect this date and how well this morning below milk hill a gigantic 800ft formation appeared in the shape of a figure eight there have of course been those who have shouted contrived but it seems the new formation has gone down well with those we have thus far talked to time will tell as to how this formation will ultimately be viewed it is no coincidence that the chinese chose to open the olympic games on this special date the number eight is considered a lucky number in chinese culture

3870180 whys he buying womens underwear on easter island its the first time hes left the country in 4 years
3870181 it seems as if once women set their footprints in the wet concrete of history and start making own choices without having to consult a man before doing so the men start to get all uppity
3870182 where in the world could one look for inspiration for a guide on how to keep women in their place where could we possibly look for a shining model on how to integrate fundamentalist religion with government while using the correct gender conservative ideals declaring that each gender has a proscribed place in society
3870183 in the end theres nothing that you cant turn around and blame on a woman this time weve got well she didnt have enough sex with him in other instances it will be come on whatd she expect if she was going to burn the roast and then talk back
3870184 anyone who believes the rape myth that women are responsible for rape if they have been drinking can do real harm to women who have been raped this advertisement is one more reinforcement of a myth that is already way too prevelant
3870185 it is said that while politicians in particular are used to wielding power and keeping people under him in check no one is working for this man without getting something in return and that is where the appeal of prostitutes comes in
3870186 help chip away the cone of silence that surrounds a crime with humiliation at its core
3870187 smart and rational rape survivors are supposed to carefully guard their secret unless they are being brave by cooperating with law enforcement if you dont shut up about rape or dont only reveal what happened to you in hushed tones then you are suspect the dangerousness of coming out as someone who has been raped is what should have all of us concerned and dedicated to eliminating this danger
3870188 rape is simply sex women enjoy sex so rape cannot be such a terrible physical ordeal to suggest that rape when conducted without violence is a serious crime is like suggesting that forcefeeding a woman chocolate cake is a heinous offence a woman would be more inconvenienced by having her handbag snatched
3870189 i suggest that anyone tempted to make such objections really think a bit harder about the difference between doing something when you choose to do it and enjoying doing it when it is your choice versus being forced to do it at someone elses choice with no care for your safety or dignity and that someone being gratified at you being powerless to stop them
3870190 truly free choices are almost impossible within a societal and medical patriarchy in which birthing is considered a stupendously dangerous messy primitive terrifying process which must be timed and controlled and scrutineered and interfered with in the normal course of things
3870191 the concept that beatie doesnt feel like being pregnant threatens his identity as a man seems to be difficult to understand for those who are still not entirely comfortable even with those who break down gender roles such as a female boss a stay at home dad etc let alone challenge the concept of gender as a simple binary divided by an impenetrable wall
3870192 why is this even in the news because even though it was just a miscarriage it involves scandalous dirty female sex behavior in the shape of teen pregnancy and a trash can thats why homicide cops faugh why not just institute the houston p d criminal uterus unit and be done with it
3870193 perpetuating the virgin whore stuff hurts all women not just the
3870194 fourteen years after i started bleeding every month i feel like ive mostly gotten the hang of it
3870195 women have body hair we choose to manipulate it or get rid of it but pure and simple we have it and i have always been of the opinion that we should be able to simply have it and should not feel obligated to do anything about that
3870196 put down the damned razor and love your body the way it is naturally not the way youve been taught it ought to be by refusing to participate personally but becoming one more woman who challenges the status quo by loving her body hair you become one more soldier in the army fighting towards making womens bodily self esteem and equality a reality
3870197 i dont think i can bear the obsessive weighing and measuring of womens bodies in what one would assume from the title would be a work precisely about refusing to let numbers rule womens lives
3870198 if feminism is about social change it is about recognizing that safety in this society is a fantasy afforded only by assimilation to power and the cost of that fake safety is the safety of those who cannot or will not access it if feminism is about social change it is about radically challenging prisons and borders of all kinds
3870199 perhaps then trans women do have insights to offer in the debate as to why our issues have a place in feminism if nothing else we must surely agree that gender variance and how we express it should be a right common to all if we are serious about ending discrimination

3870221 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3870222 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3870223 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3870224 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3870225 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3870226 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

3870230 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3870231 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3870232 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3870233 i always compare it to when steve perry went and did oh sherrie which is a fucking journey song
3870234 it sounded exactly like journey and thats fucked up i dont want to do that
3870235 i feel like im waving the flag for musicianship trying to bring back bands that can play
3870236 it seems like a lot of music today is so churned out and simple i like playing these festivals because its one thing all day and then here i come on and everyones like whoa then back to the grind
3870237 it sounds like a banjo but they sing with it and its the most fucking passionate emotional music ive ever heard in my life
3870238 i want to include that in my album because its so passionate like when you hear a korn song and its really going crazy these guys do it with a stringy banjo i want to bring that to kids here who are like what the fuck is this and open their minds up to something different
3870239 its no secret that i had my problems during my last few years in korn
3870240 there were drug issues and i just wasnt enjoying the music any more thats why im so excited about this album i poured everything i had into it and i think ive really connected with the fans which was one of the primary purposes for doing it hopefully it will inspire those who hear it i hope they feel the magic again the same kind of feeling that i now have
3870241 its great that everyone agreed that flush should be the albums first single
3870242 it talks about flushing the bad things out of your life and trying to get a fresh start thats the story of my life over the last few years as i look back on everything i went through in korn all the drugs and alcohol i guess the bottom line is that im glad im not dead i apparently survived all of that for a reason and hopefully im fulfilling some of that now
3870243 life is boring simple story get drunk throw up sleep all day i am something im not nothing i cant let myself decay
3870244 heres a song yall all know if you dont fucking know this song youre not a korn fan
3870245 dont get hung up on the numbers what you want is the feeling put that foremost in your mind
3870246 365 thats one of the biggest compliments ive ever heard sometimes i imagine i post too much
3870247 jeannette makes law of attraction be the fun it is meant to be
3870248 making decisions based on our top values will always repeat always lead to more fulfillment
3870249 yes you did jeannette i told you a long time ago
3870250 have you ever had such a bad haircut that you just wanted to cry
3870251 jeannette you have to realize you have to trim the yard
3870252 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3870253 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3870254 no more thats the last web i spin it didnt deliver and some hulking cosmic force came along and wrecked the lot nope ill just sit in this corner now and sulk webspinning doesnt work
3870255 thank you yes please more of that but with the warm smile we saw earlier
3870256 thank you but remember how we talked about available and chews with mouth closed more of that please
3870257 hmmm an airplane crash is definitely a crisis and one in which we usually have little power and in my world being let go might be considered a similar life crisis
3870258 yes youre going through what others would label a life crisis
3870259 the universe has my best interests at heart and delivers perfection every single time always perfection
3870260 wow they hardly ever ever fire anyone i must have done something really bad
3870261 few things are more worthy of letting go of than the habitual thoughts which lead to feelings of pain rejection resentment bitterness and anger
3870262 its like a scab if you pick at it it will re open fester and likely become infected
3870263 1 pick an old grudge resentment pain or rant youre still holding onto it doesnt matter if the other person is dead or alive or how old the ache youve got stuck in your craw write down one concise sentence summing up what youre still upset about
3870264 from this day forth i release myself from this resentment i have suffered i have been blessed i am letting go and i am moving on
3870265 5 tear up the piece of paper or burn it ceremonially you may feel a rush of energy released when you do so the rush comes from the energy youre reclaiming as you let go of the old resentment
3870266 i expect for us to be on time to go somewhere i annouce it days in advance we agree on a time to leave the house and i am hoping emphasis added we leave the house at that time
3870267 i intend to connect with so and so a mutual acquaintance on friday
3870268 i always expect my performance and my attitude to be better today than yesterday
3870269 ive always expected my business to produce over 100 million in worldwide sales and it has
3870270 ever since i was a kid growing up in el salvador i expected my income to someday in the very near future increase to over one million dollars a year and it has more than tripled that amount
3870271 i expected to come to the usa and help thousands of people worldwide and by being involved in network marketing i have been able to accomplish this goal
3870272 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
3870273 it was a mistake to launch iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
3870274 if they opened it up a bit more i dont think it would hurt them and it would give them a lot better quality assurance
3870275 they just cant control everything and theyre losing valuable input that they could get from lots of people
3870276 its ok to have problems as long as you admit to them and fix them in fact if you admit to them and fix them it turns out to be an effect that creates more intense loyalty than you would expect
3870277 ive seen a number of issues with apple that would stop other vendors in their tracks and people are willing to give apple a break there

3870280 there are a number of impressive potential vice presidential candidates and this is a singular decision for one person and that is barack obama
3870281 but personally id be hopeful in the list of serious candidates to be considered would be chuck hagel whether it be for the veep position or a serious position in an obama administration
3870282 sen hagel has no intention of getting involved in any of the campaigns and is not planning to endorse either candidate
3870283 between one candidate john mccain whos always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
3870284 in the 3 years barack obama has been in the senate with all respect there is very little evidence of that kind of bipartisan outreach
3870285 john mccain has lived it worked it done it thats why i think in the end which is election day which we hope is just the beginning there are going to be many more democrats who will vote for john mccain than republicans who will vote for barack obama
3870286 theres no better side show in football that a qb competition and this season football fans will have one of the biggest qb competitions in nfl history and these guys dont even play on the same team
3870287 heres to hoping aaron rodgers can fill favres shoes for green bay but you know if he chokes this season and brett puts up numbers like he did last year ceo mark murphy and head coach mike mccarthy might forever live in packers infamy
3870288 even the experience of i am is a concept its temporary it comes one day and it will go

3870355 i think youll find that this is the real deal
3870356 only by truly listening to the stories of soldiers whove come home can we appreciate the realities of war and what we can do to help
3870357 you are as j nachtway alex majoli alexandra boulat brave reportage good good job

3870363 zoriah your pictures bring out so many emotions in me im at a loss for words they are heart wrenching and thought provoking thank you for sharing
3870364 theres a deep meaning in every photo youve been at the right time and place some photos made me cry and at the same time i was happy to see such a photostream its one of a kind thank you so much for sharing
3870365 zoriah is a real photographer thank you zoriah for showing us the truth
3870366 your work is beyond words almost to point of emotional breakpoint
3870367 a riveting unflinching set of some of the most poignant photography ive ever come across
3870368 tus fotos son increibles impactantes el tratado de blanco y negro es fenomenal me quito el sombrero ya me gustar a a mi poder hacer trabajos de ese tipo
3870369 you have some outstanding work i checked your site and i understand why you have won awards you really cover your subject matter with an expert eye very inspiring and eye opening i will check back often
3870370 muito muito muito com o seu trabalho meus sinceros parabens fico feliz em ver fotografos engajados com a luta dos povos beijos e fortes abra os solid rios
3870371 this is stunning you have a rare ability to find sensitive moments in some very insensitive situations what a talent
3870372 incredible not just because they are excellent photographs but because they are frighteningly honest i hope you continue to make these strong thought provoking records and that you stay safe in what must be incredibly difficult situations both physically and emotionally
3870373 it would be somewhat of an understatement to say i was impressed with your work we obviously know how dangerous it is to be involved in that theater iraq im sure that every moment of every day is just on the verge of chaotic for what is that war war if not the ultimate of chaos and yet you have these moments where you pause to compose image of graphic quality equal to content admire all you compositional skills but am especially taken by the wideangle work do your best to do so and know youre held in high esteem
3870374 i have to confess that i couldnt sleep properly after seeing your photos the first time these images are still in my mind and wont let me go
3870375 there is a great passion in every single shot and im very impressed sad shocked touched deeply moved frightened and inspired in the same way you are documenting a very important episode of history your pictures speak for themselves and your work is beyond words your work is not easy as it is difficult to photograph people in distress however it concerns us all and we shall not forget
3870376 into the very depths of my soul i cannot begin to even sum up with words the depths of how your images reach out to me it brings me down to earth and reminds me as to why i picked up the camera in the first place your works are truly inspiring youre very privileged to have to see these places with your own eyes observe and capture through your lens the true state of the world we live in as for now for me itll have to be through your eyes your pictures and the stories they tell truly honored
3870377 there is a hunger to know the truth about war and your accurate presentation of it is exemplary i dont believe it possible to be unmoved by your images this is especially true for those of us who live in a very different world essentially free from the suffering and carnage you portray thank you for your dedication and courage you are making and incredible contribution to world understanding hopefully not at an extreme cost to yourself war photography seems like a hard way to make a living on many levels living and breathing civilian trauma is not easy but it is more localized you can get away from it by driving or moving to another location but with war there is no escape the reality is so harsh and overwhelmingly pervasive into all areas of life stay safe many will be following you
3870378 thanks zoriah for your hard work and incredible vision and for the inspiration your example lends to others who have put down the gun or never carried one
3870379 all i can say its very very impressive keep up the good work the world must know

3870382 after watching your pics i m absolutely tired exhausted sooooo much information inside them one day i will make pictures like yours but it will take me three or four lives to learn to do it not great but incredible work thanks for showing us all the way master
3870383 i feel honored after i have seen your great work one day maybe with more time i hope i will also be able to take the picture i like going to those place where a photographer contribute can be of a help to improve the quality of life of all those people suffering thank you again

3870394 your photographs are incredible powerful and touching i admire that you have a background in humanitarian aid
3870395 congratulations for your work your images give us a glampse about what war is about humiliation pain only for interests you make this horrible thing seem human thank you

3870403 ive seen many war photos and met a few war photographers but zoriahs work deeply touched me
3870404 simply excelent its a great reportage of a difficult situation
3870405 deserves to take a well earned place in history in the company of phillip jones griffith don mc cullen larry burrows and robert capa the minimal presentation of his work is perfect the viewer fills in the details and the images linger stubbornly in the memory to awake one from sleep in a cold sweat these images cannot be taken in in one viewing the viewer returns restlessly again and again attempting to process the information this is really happening iconic compelling images of war by a true professional i take my hat off to him
3870406 a chilling commentary on the madness of war all war

3870498 all of the sudden he comes from around the corner two to three feet away and said you need to watch your mouth
3870499 he was dressed like a firefighter and i wasnt about to let somebody i didnt know make me go outside with him
3870500 he tried to talk to her but he didnt have a choice
3870501 there were people standing around kids and parents wondering if he was going to do anything about this
3870502 if she would have said yes sir there would have been no problem and she would have been able to walk off but there was not really much else he could do he has to uphold the law
3870503 i probably wouldnt have acted that way if i knew what was going on
3870504 it happened so fast i didnt know how to react he was being a real smart ass himself
3870505 i told him only when people are treating me wrongly

3870533 this basic intervention implementing a household smoking ban has the potential to promote antismoking norms and to prevent adolescent smoking
3870534 adolescents are faced with so many influences that contribute to smoking attitudes and behaviors to find that a simple household rule that bans smoking in the home has a meaningful impact on smoking attitudes and behaviors is somewhat surprising
3870535 this study provides evidence that even in a smoke free home environment parental behavior remains a strong influence on teen smoking attitudes and behavior
3870536 these bans send a strong message to teens that its not okay to smoke and in the face of so many other external factors that may influence teens to smoke peers advertising a home smoking policy is one thing that parents can control to some extent

3870667 it was quite well documented about whether it was four or five years im very pleased i signed a five year deal because i feel i have many years to come even though ive just turned 30 i dont think about the end
3870668 i think about these five years and maybe more after that maybe it was a case of us both sitting down and realising what we both wanted to do
3870669 i feel these will be my best years ive never been a player relying on pace or the things that can change with age
3870670 what my team mates did for me at the end of last season on the pitch against manchester united and many things off the pitch after that is something i will never forget

3870717 terrorism and statecraft al qaeda and western covert operations after the cold war
3870718 covert destabilization in new theatres of operation strategically close to russian and chinese influence namely eastern europe the balkans the caucasus and central asia
3870719 al qaeda is therefore a euphemism for western covert operations specializing in destabilization
3870720 terror assassination performed for reasons different from the publicized ones often initiated by persons or groups other than those suspected of the act and secretly perpetrated by or on behalf of the violated state itself
3870721 the left embraces a distorted notion of political violence that sees it as an understandable response of the weak to provocations of the powerful yet acts of terror are vulnerable to manipulation and far more likely to be a weapon of state rulers and their agents than of the oppressed masses as a legitimized protection racket the state may be tempted to inflict harm secretly on its own citizens to achieve highly desired goals
3870722 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3870723 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3870724 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3870725 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3870726 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3870727 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

3870730 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3870731 not only those who commit atrocities are responsible but so are those who fail to react in a way russians are fighting a proxy war with the west through us

3870734 the border has been along this river for 1 000 years
3870735 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3870736 but you know its not in the 21st century to bomb a neighbor country its not a good idea
3870737 i say once again its better to compete on the field rather than outside the field
3870738 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3870739 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3870740 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3870741 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3870742 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3870743 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3870744 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3870745 who are open to doing something on the production side
3870746 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3870747 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3870748 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3870749 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3870750 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3870751 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3870752 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3870753 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3870754 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3870755 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3870756 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3870757 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3870758 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3870759 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3870760 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3870761 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3870762 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3870763 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3870764 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3870765 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3870766 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3870767 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3870768 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3870769 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3870770 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3870771 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3870772 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3870773 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3870774 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3870775 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3870776 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3870777 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3870778 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3870779 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3870780 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3870781 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3870782 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3870783 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3870784 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3870785 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3870786 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3870787 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3870788 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3870789 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3870790 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3870791 i listened to george bushs statement and was surprised the facts he cited are untrue
3870792 we understand that the us is concerned about the fate of this project but the united states will have to choose between defending its prestige over a virtual project or a real partnership that requires joint action
3870793 we have failed to adequately protect the right of our troops to participate in our democratic process
3870794 we ask that the doj investigate and determine whether the federal voting assistance program fvap is fulfilling its legal obligations to provide overseas u s military service members and their dependents with the necessary information and assistance to register to vote request and receive absentee ballots and vote
3870795 we encourage voters to use our new tool now available on our web site to complete the voter registration and absentee ballot request form using only the specific information they need for their state
3870796 voters from participating states and jurisdictions may also use the feature to send a completed signed and scanned registration and ballot request form to their local election office and receive their blank ballot online via a secure server
3870797 these advancements will provide military and overseas voters an easier way to register and request absentee ballots as well as another alternative to the by mail process of absentee voting without sacrificing the security of the voters identity
3870798 ready access to information regarding voter registration requirements and deadlines absentee ballot applications requirements and deadlines and the availability of voting assistance officers to assist members and dependents to understand and comply with these requirements
3870799 crank 2 in may shooting basically the entire movie with the simple
3870800 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3870801 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3870802 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3870803 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3870804 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3870805 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3870806 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3870807 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3870808 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3870809 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3870810 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3870811 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

3870824 whether or not it goes beyond that we dont know but we dont want to turn pixar into a live action studio in fact the intent is that the special effects will not be done at pixar we are not trying to become a special effects company

3870828 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
3870829 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
3870830 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
3870831 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
3870832 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender

3870840 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3870841 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

3870843 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3870844 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3870845 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3870846 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3870847 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3870848 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3870849 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3870850 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3870851 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3870852 since the website is essentially the gateway to the new film it was imperative to create a site which conveys the sexiness and immense budget of the film
3870853 it was also important for the website to allow easy access to all things pirates pirates ii stagnettis revenge is more than just a movie its an experience and we want everyone to be able to participate
3870854 its amazing how easy it is for stores to get a hold of pirates banners and wallpapers for their website homepages
3870855 even better stores can contact me or craig and request us to add a link to the banner so that when a customer clicks on the banner it takes them directly to the sales page theres even a countdown clock on the webpage so stores should start to get their orders in as soon as possible this is the biggest adult film in history and copies will fly off the shelves on september 27
3870856 my favorite part of the site is the video section

3870963 its really disconcerting to me that theyre making such a personal attack against him
3870964 its not surprising that tom suozzi is trying to defend david patersons tax gimmick after all it was suozzis idea but suozzi is dead wrong to say the governor has been personally attacked david paterson has been around long enough to know whats personal and whats about policy

3871177 obviously our multi platform olympic strategy is a success but this record breaking olympic performance is proving that network television is more alive than ever we are breaking records that are 20 30 and nearly 50 years old this is a fantastic triumph for network tv
3871178 the beauty of the tami is that we can optimize the way we measure content across all of our platforms and evaluate how each platform is being used over time when we look at the first few days of tami data its clear that while the power of broadcast television remains unmatched consumers are seeking out and taking advantage of all the different platforms offering olympic coverage creating an entirely new olympic experience
3871179 chinese tradition has many good things but weve ditched them
3871180 i feel there have to be people to carry them on
3871181 most of my generation has a smooth happy life including me
3871182 i feel like our character lacks something for example love for the country or the perseverance you get from conquering hardships those virtues i dont see them in myself and many people my age
3871183 china was backward throughout its modern history so we were always seeking the reasons for why the west grew strong
3871184 we learned from the west all of us who are educated have this dream grow strong by learning from the west
3871185 weve been studying western history for so long we understand it well
3871186 we think our love for china our support for the government and the benefits of this country is not a spontaneous reaction it has developed after giving the matter much thought
3871187 because we are in such a system we are always asking ourselves whether we are brainwashed
3871188 we are always eager to get other information from different channels

3871202 there are approximately 192 million privately owned firearms in the u s 65 million of which are handguns police foundations 1996
3871203 in 1997 32 436 americans were killed with firearms in homicides suicides and accidents in comparison 33 651 americans were killed in the korean war and 58 148 americans were killed in the vietnam war national center for health statistics 1997
3871204 more than 1 2 million elementary aged latch key children have access to guns in their homes lee journal of the american medical association 1990
3871205 were kidding ourselves if we think that some kind of unconstitutional ban on firearms is going to turn our statistics into anything like those you have in western europe

3871215 our political masters should have more important things on their minds than to introduce legislation that will be impossible to enforce and was motivated by class hatred
3871216 im not sure that many most hunters and hunt supporters would specifically claim to be the elite although what is wrong with elitism better than this dumbed down quagmire that the uk seems to be rolling in at the moment although thats another rant most many hunter and hunt supporters are normal people who happen to live in the countryside
3871217 what we have is a generally wealthy group who understand and protect the land being punished im not a supporter of hunting but i see them as a bit of an enemy of your enemy is your friend
3871218 how the fox is located is totally irrelevant to animal welfare considerations it took me ten years to realise this irrefutable fact others will never realise it because bigotry prejudice narrow mindedness class animosity and ignorance blind people to the truth
3871219 now that nastia liukin and shawn johnson finished with their team competition the two can separate themselves and get back to their focus as individuals the exciting thing for the united states is that they have two athletes who couldnt be more different in terms of look in terms of their style of gymnastics but both very capable with coming away with the all around gold medal i think the competition will really be a showdown between two american gymnasts
3871220 its going to take a phenomenal performance for a chinese athlete to place into gold medal contention
3871221 yang wei from china is unquestionably the frontrunner and it would be a huge surprise of the games if he did not come away with that gold medal
3871222 going in for the competition the u s needed to be just about perfect and they also needed a little help from china with some errors really neither of those two things happened the chinese won a well deserved gold medal in the team
3871223 i firmly believe that if team usa went out and did what they were capable of doing they could actually win a bronze medal they did everything that they needed to do and they got a little bit of help from some of their biggest competitors
3871224 i dont think that the age issue had a factor at all relative to the u s girls performance i really believe that they were fairly well insulated from that and so its a total non issue in regard to the usas performance

3871234 the russia first approach to the neighborhood is probably the biggest failure not only in european neighborhood policy but in eu conflict prevention policies
3871235 it is quite clear that conflict resolution doesnt work without russia or in confrontation to russia
3871236 but it also doesnt work without calling into question the role of russia as a mediator and monopolist peacekeeper in the georgian secessionist conflicts
3871237 this document has a clear indication there should be internationalization of the process which is to say there are temporary arrangements for now but later it should be replaced with participation from the eu and the un
3871238 there is no eu when it comes to conflict resolution in georgia there are only member states
3871239 were sure that theres probably some facts and information thats just not available i mean you see a lot on the video but we need to make sure everything is revealed before we take any action
3871240 highlighting canadian culture on the world stage not only benefits artists it also helps generate tourism immigration business and investment back in canada limiting international exposure of canadian excellence is a short sighted move by the government
3871241 while the government maintains that it wants to encourage trade and coproduction to attract foreign investment we find it paradoxical that it has chosen to eliminate the trade routes program which has a specific mandate to help companies in our sector export
3871242 and these cuts are in addition to the governments refusal to respond to the needs of our community for increased support to feature films theatrical documentaries and co production
3871243 we are concerned that cuts to canadian cultural funds will harm the film and television industry at a time when many producers are looking at what impact the internet and other federal funding policies will have on them in years to come
3871244 we need to remind the government of this to make certain our industry isnt slowly chipped away by successive cuts to the support programs that ensure its viability and success
3871245 we are actually reviewing iphones from a hsbc group perspective and when i say that i mean globally
3871246 a decision on a piece of hardware like that would potentially be deployed conservatively to 200 000 people
3871247 you know its a big decision especially when you have an existing fleet out there

3871250 the situation today was far better than yesterday though 23 incidents of stone pelting and arson occurred across the valley today

3871252 it is important that tankers and trucks carrying essential supplies are not stopped by people i appeal to everybody to ensure that these are allowed so that the common man here does not suffer

3871264 there are so few judicial opinions dealing with open source licenses that any single one is of great interest but the pro open source ruling in jacobsen v katzer easily goes to the top of the charts of this small category this is a highly significant opinion that will greatly bolster the efforts of the open source community to control the use of open source software according to the terms set out in open source licenses
3871265 we consider here the ability of a copyright holder to dedicate certain work to free public use and yet enforce an open source copyright license to control the future distribution and modification of that work

3871270 when security is scarce people retreat to their ethnic religious or tribal groups they begin to mistrust anyone outside the clan if the government remains weak they start providing for their own security creating or expanding militias this pattern has repeated itself in dozens of examples including the balkans and now of course iraq

3871283 we are pleased with the solid first half growth that we have experienced especially in the second quarter
3871284 we continue to see strength in the business as a result of better operational flow attributed to the warehouse move and increased traffic to the site with the launch of project runway season 5 given the challenges that retailers are facing in this macro economic environment we believe we are well positioned for a strong second half
3871285 after the blacklist focused contest was completed we ran the samples through coretrace s whitelisting solution bouncer
3871286 by not allowing any of the samples to execute on the host computer bouncer stopped 100 percent of the viruses i strongly recommend that companies add application whitelisting solutions like bouncer to their arsenal
3871287 the race to zero contest demonstrates the difficulties traditional antivirus programs have in detecting progressively more complex malware
3871288 in lieu of blacklisting solutions many companies are moving toward the next generation of endpoint security whitelisting in order to defend their it networks
3871289 rapid acceptance of our technology by the consumer electronics market is reflected by our record pipeline of over 14 million in signed contracts which we expect to continue growing based on the number of new customer inquiries we are receiving thereby reinforcing our enthusiasm for the future of qpc
3871290 the production phases of our existing contracts are paced by our customers product rollout schedules and we have not yet realized the full revenue stream available from these contracts as a result revenues for the first 6 months were not significantly changed from last year but we expect this to improve as our customers move their qpc lasers powered products to the market in the second quarter we signed a 3 5 million contract for 3d laser projection applications which we expect to ramp into production later this summer and received initial orders for potential new application design in from several of the largest players in the industry these orders represent very large potential new contracts for qpc and further validate our technological advantages in visible laser technology
3871291 we are particularly pleased to see some of the new and emerging applications of our generation iii technology our lasers are now enabling more environmentally friendly metals and plastics processing enhanced mri medical imaging and new late stage cancer treatments and surgical applications
3871292 we expect our consumer electronics and medical business segments to continue to be strong growth drivers for us over the next two years as the market continues the adoption of laser solutions and as our customers begin ramping into production accordingly in order to ensure we able fully capitalize on this unique opportunity we have retained two separate financial advisors to assist us in exploring various strategic opportunities available to us
3871293 opportunities in the consumer and medical markets position us for growth over the next two years in particular our two major consumer electronics contracts which comprise of an 11 million purchase order for laser tv applications and our recent 3 5 million contract for 3d laser projection applications
3871294 we continue to make progress in our discussions with a number of potential strategic partners which if successful could provide us with the capital industry expertise and other key resources to help us accelerate growth
3871295 we have also taken aggressive steps in reducing our expenses by over 150 000 per month as part of our ongoing cost management efforts designed to improve our financial footing and to take qpc one step closer towards our target of cash flow breakeven in 2009 we have continued confidence in our sustainable technological advantages and robust vertical markets

3871308 there are others whose lives and future depend on you stepping up and living big
3871309 you cannot even begin to live the dream god has for you until you stop living only for yourself

3871349 chinas leaders know the development of green buildings is a critical need and the olympic village can serve as a model for this development
3871350 with this award the olympic village is being recognized for its contributions to making this years olympics the greenest ever
3871351 on day one we were given instructions in terms of implementing a green agenda
3871352 there was a general objective that this was the green olympics so we had to consider energy conservation and water recycling but in terms of details it was up to designers to come up with solutions
3871353 the water cube is very much a green building because of the way the buildings features work it had inherent advantages of saving energy and also retaining and recycling rainwater
3871354 china is going through a green push and theres a lot of buildings that have these elements water recycling maximizing natural light etc its all moving in that direction
3871355 we demand that the delimitation process should be started at the earliest
3871356 the bjp is proving it is the cause of the problem
3871357 we too have asked for a fee structure ranging from rs 55 000 to 65 000 even the sfi colleges charge 32 000 ptc colleges charge rs 20 000 and bed college charge rs 30 000 fee pharmacy is a professional course with pre requisites like laboratories for practical experiments unfortunately though the fee structure has never been decided according to norms
3871358 by august 31 the new fee structure will be decided we are studying the issue and cant comment on the issue at this moment
3871359 its not about a prosperous kashmir but about the sentiment of azadi
3871360 even when it was all peaceful and cm ghulam nabi azad talked of a khush hal kashmir i kept telling people that it would all change
3871361 what is wrong with dual currency demand which we had raised and were termed anti national what was so wrong with seeking a return of those who have renounced violence from across the border rehabilitation of former militants with seeking opening of all traditional routes with reduction of troops
3871362 the only solution to the present crisis is that the prime minister should speak to pakistan to fix a date for opening the road and starting traffic across the border
3871363 he was more loyal than the king he tried to please governor s k sinha but failed to see the repercussions where was the need to give land
3871364 we are not shying away from joint responsibility but it was on pursuance of azad as for pdp my father had rejected the proposal
3871365 muzaffarabad road was our agenda led to fruition by my father as chief minister we lost 13 lives in uri in 2005 to push for it the separatists had opposed it geelani had termed it a ploy to dilute the kashmir issue
3871366 understanding corporate sponsored academic pedigrees gives us an enlightened perspective on puppet libertarians and the powell cabal corporations can only thrive through the protections of strong government as alexander hamilton was quick to point out as the first federalist yet puppet libertarians fault government as the biggest impediment to a free market if that sounds mad well there is a motive to their madness corporations replace the natural merits of a free market economy with culturally infused greed when government acts to temper the effects of greed in a culturally biased market this undermines the primary objective of most business corporations economists such as friedman and landsburg are libertarians in the sense that they want maximum liberty for business corporations that specialize in capital but they are puppets in their advocacy for a system that undermines free markets
3871367 during the first half of the year we took proactive measures to more effectively leverage our network of websites and grow our zvue products business we have made substantial progress in our efforts as evidenced by the following initiatives pursued during the second quarter first we restructured our online media division by moving all of our web operations to rochester resulting in anticipated annualized expense savings of 1 4 million primarily from reduced headcount and consulting costs in doing so we have enhanced our ability to leverage the popsauce network anchored by ebaumsworld com with our sales partner gorilla nation secondly we successfully launched three new products into our retail network which are detailed below on the corporate side in july we restructured agreements with two of our key stakeholders to better align our business goals
3871368 overall our revenue increased 445 year over year in q2 and 267 year over year in the first half of 2008 our product division produced significant year over year results posting approximately 246 growth in q2 and 56 growth for the first half versus the prior year s periods this year we have introduced three new players featuring pre loaded content including the spirit player which was a compilation of great music from universal music group our exclusive journey mp3 player and elvis mp3 player with video that are currently in wal mart stores these products confirm our belief that we can develop and market exciting players pre loaded with content we have significantly reduced our product development costs while accelerating the number of opportunities upon which we can execute including the players currently in our channel we will have shipped over 100 000 units nearly equal to our sales from all of 2007 with the peak selling season still in front of us
3871369 we also today are announcing the resignation of tom hillman our interim chief financial officer effective august 15th 2008
3871370 leveraging our network of websites and audience has allowed us to entertain over 6 5 million unique visitors on average in q2 2008 according to comscore advertisers continue to see the appealing aspects of our targeted demographics overall we believe our progress and the positive changes we have made during the first half of the year will better position us for continued improvement in the business and operating results

3871376 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough said dr erin michos co investigator for the study
3871377 its easy to see why people are so enthusiastic about the potential power of vitamin d but we must recognize the limitations of any study and exercise caution when making any broad public health recommendations said mary picciano a senior nutrition scientist at the nih who co authored a report on the conference published this month in the american journal of clinical nutrition
3871378 theres still a lot we dont know about how vitamin d levels affect health especially across different age groups and ethnic populations picciano said
3871379 whether its the cause or the end all be all is another question
3871380 it may in the end take a cocktail like we do with hiv
3871381 in light of your failure to nominate competent candidates for president of the usa and thus to govern yourselves we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence effective immediately
3871382 her sovereign majesty queen elizabeth ii will resume monarchical duties over all states commonwealths and territories except kansas which she does not fancy
3871383 lets pollute the air for humans too while we kill off all the animals
3871384 if approved the changes would represent the biggest overhaul of the endangered species act since 1988 they would accomplish through regulations what conservative republicans have been unable to achieve in congress ending some environmental reviews that developers and other federal agencies blame for delays and cost increases on many projects
3871385 the administration also tried to jettison the entire rule outright a gambit that was struck down in court though legal action continues more recently bush appointees have worked on rescinding the rule one state at a time it has launched rollback processes in idaho and colorado two states with more than 13 million roadless areas between them in each state they are pursuing phony replacement rules shot full of loopholes that would jeopardize millions and millions of wildland acres
3871386 if you watched the countries marching in during opening ceremonies you had to say wait a minute
3871387 you expect everyone to have women in their delegation but when they dont we barely pause its so ingrained its almost like thats the way it is supposed to be
3871388 while i was working on a report about human rights and child marriages it struck me we are the only country in the world that does not allow women to play any sport
3871389 even iran for example has thriving female sports organizations and leagues qatar is starting female sports teams somalia afghanistan iraq offer something but not my country and this disgusts me more disgusting is the silence of the west to be honest
3871390 i asked my mother what if you had a daughter who wanted to be a gymnast
3871391 she said they are not wearing clothes i dont think she had a problem with the women competing but the way i feel why i do this is that i have always been an activist on human rights and i believe that if you allow women to play sports womens rights everywhere will be much improved
3871392 the way the economys been going we have lost homes because the rate theyve been receiving has not kept up with the cost of living
3871393 it hurts them it hurts the system it hurts children they could have benefited
3871394 there is a downturn i think its fair to speculate that people are making difficult economic decisions
3871395 what they are saying is that ignoring russias interests is going to come at a price and theyve said it in a pretty brutal way
3871396 they are in a position to say enough is enough
3871397 as a turning point no less significant than nov 9 1989 when the berlin wall fell
3871398 the kremlins message is crystal clear dont tread on me
3871399 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
3871400 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
3871401 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
3871402 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
3871403 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
3871404 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
3871405 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
3871406 the officials most directly implicated in the misconduct left the department to the accompaniment of substantial negative publicity
3871407 prior to this change retirees had to have 20 years of active duty service or be retired at age 60 from the guard or reserve
3871408 if you didnt have 20 years you werent eligible however with the ndaa expansion if you are medically retired either permanently or temporarily and you have va payments that reduce your retirement pay you are eligible to apply for crsc
3871409 that way if you do not qualify and something in the law or department of defense crsc policy changes in the future that could affect the prior decision like the 2008 ndaa we will already have a claim and documentation and can reassess a claim based on the new eligibility factors
3871410 if you answered yes to those questions and have not submitted your crsc claim you should do so
3871411 the money is tax free and could help pay medical expenses or improve your quality of life
3871412 in this world nothing can be said to be certain except death and taxes
3871413 it was actually thought it was really weird all night pete would just take pictures will people like he was this robot of some sort just making rounds through the crowd taking pictures appointing his assistant to get your name so youre tagged appropriately and moving on
3871414 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3871415 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3871416 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3871417 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3871418 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3871419 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3871420 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3871421 the slave has but one master the man of ambition has as many as there are people useful to his fortune
3871422 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3871423 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3871424 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3871425 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3871426 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3871427 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3871428 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3871429 yes i understand im going to have to wait in line but apple is totally worth it
3871430 shit i waited in this line for 2 hours and now i have to leave to get to work
3871431 i will pay you 100 for your front of the line spot
3871432 shes not dead yet she must get dead maybe everyone needs to hear more about how i think america isnt ready for a girl president even though shes not running for president anymore cause she lost and jumped on the party unity road which is obviously a ploy meant to steal baracks phallus from me
3871433 i mean hey isnt it always moms fault except my own mom of course who by the way warned me about excessive sarcasm so im not her fault either
3871434 hey chicago slim and i have a lot in common we both have the phallus where it matters
3871435 i just know hillary went racial and it was hillary that did anything to win not barack even though he did win by well doing what he had to do when a manly slim outsider stud bucket sucker punches a girl you better believe she had it coming
3871436 that hillary was entirely insincere when she told her staff to avoid anything racial and to avoid releasing any videos that would hurt him if he were the ge candidate i mean whom does she think she was fooling anyways moi
3871437 and even though i first wrote that barack couldnt close the deal and got a lot of water cooler creds thanx i now realize that it was really hillary channeling my fertile brain one night when i was up late and there was a full moon and my cat started acting really freaky that that that hillary is sooooo shameless and sooooo hussedly like nothing can be put past her
3871438 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
3871439 as far as im concerned at 3 oclock in the morning nobody has any business being on the street except the law
3871440 anyone out at 3 oclock shouldnt be out on the street unless youre going to the hospital
3871441 the u s court of appeals for the third circuit just made hundreds of colleges wonder how long their restrictive speech codes can survive
3871442 c olleges and universities generally know the game is up
3871443 will have little plausible defense if they insist on speech codes as nebulous and facially unconstitutional as temples
3871444 our amnesia about what is natural is the greatest threat to the environment
3871445 some may say that it is irresponsible to make such predictions pending further detailed study to be sure of every point however we will never be certain about every detail and it would be irresponsible to remain silent in the face of what we already know
3871446 lack of political will and the greed of special interests
3871447 simply enforcing the standards of the magnuson stevens act and the u s national marine fisheries service would result in major improvements in u s waters within a decade
3871448 the weather we have experienced in dane county over the last year should remind us that our planet deserves our best stewardship efforts
3871449 we need to do everything we can to reverse the negative effects of human activity on global systems that nurture all of life
3871450 a youtube partner made a copyright claim on one of your videos

3871452 so long as we do not have political stability we cant tackle both these issues properly political stability can be achieved through an approach of reconciliation as opposed to an approach of confrontation
3871453 i request all elements that they should adopt an approach of reconciliation so that there is political stability and we can confront problems like the worsening economy extremism and terrorism on a strong footing this is the need of the hour we must sink our differences and adopt the slogan of pakistan first and move forward
3871454 there is no doubt that every pakistani is with his kashmiri brothers and sisters at this juncture i have no doubt that kashmir is the heartbeat of every pakistani and i have no doubt that kashmir runs in the blood of pakistan
3871455 enemies and some elements both external and internal want to destabilise and weaken us
3871456 i believe there could be some conspiracy external or internal against our state institutions we have to stand up as a nation and prove as in 1947 that pakistan will remain united we must show this to the world
3871457 if both are there the nation gets stronger our military army navy and air force is intact and will always defend the country the people and military are one if the army has the back up of the people the oneness of the nation will be at the forefront
3871458 we can confront these menaces when the people are with the military
3871459 hitting at pakistans foundations and spoiling the image of islam
3871460 pakistans enemies have always thought that it will not remain united but the people have proved our enemies wrong pakistan has prospered and progressed

3871469 once you get to the internet then you can go look at your e mail you can go to websites you can pretty much do anything
3871470 certainly on the consumer side theres terrific growth because people have reached the point where they are familiar with wi fi they have it on their laptops and connect when they are travelling
3871471 voice over wi fi is still a cutting edge technology
3871472 people in the future will have more and more devices that are wi fi enabled
3871473 i call work as they are getting into a vehicle to drive away naturally the drunk one is driving they got all of 4 blocks before being pulled over by a black amp white thats called karma mother fuckers
3871474 all of these elements that were internal were comfortable with but the external macroeconomic items we dont have visibility so thats why we cant provide guidance for 2009
3871475 i think its more about the visibility and the increased cotton and energy prices and people are nervous about what does that mean for 2009
3871476 our business is very strong weve never had a larger open order position in the history of the company during the third quarter so were very excited and optimistic about our volumes for next year
3871477 were in that part of the summer where volume tends to be light conviction tends to be minimal

3871481 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3871482 besides him being bigger and stronger the game slows down
3871483 when you first get here as a freshman youre more worried about the plays than the execution of the plays once you know what youre doing it makes it a heckuva lot easier to perform at a high level
3871484 he is bigger and stronger but in addition to that he can see things a lot easier than at any time last year
3871485 i was dissatisfied when we were on the goal line not so much with the guys playing in the game but the people on the team were not really feeling it
3871486 some enthusiasm i can create myself but as i said to them in that one little meeting you saw me have with the guys on the field and then at the end of practice with the entire team once the players start controlling the emotion and not the coaches then youre well on your way
3871487 the more i can put walker in pressure situations the more well be able to see that
3871488 his leg strength has never been the issue its the confidence i wanted him to kick in front of the media tuesday because if he missed it the whole free world was going to know it just like if he made it thats important
3871489 even though its a minor form of pressure the fact that it wasnt a perfect snap and he drilled it right through the uprights was a good thing plus he endeared himself to his teammates at the same time
3871490 hes played with a lot of confidence and hes played very physically
3871491 and as you know physicality is something ive really tried to stress
3871492 he played tackle earlier in his career then he moved to guard and now hes back at tackle hes feeling pretty confident right now that he can help us win
3871493 he played like that in high school hes always been a talker hes one of those chirpers one of those guys that wide receivers cant stand because he chirps the whole time
3871494 as the head coach now and not the guy who has to call plays i love guys like that
3871495 i used to hate guys like that when i was on the other side of the ball because those are the guys that annoy you
3871496 but thats always been his game it was his game in high school he is as mild mannered as they come off the field but hes a chirper and he has a lot of confidence in his ability
3871497 thats the first of many verbal beat downs that hes going to take
3871498 i think hes very humorous i understand his sarcasm i understand his coaching techniques so i enjoy being around him ive gotten a few chuckles out there in practice with some of the things hes said
3871499 weve played him in that three safety package weve played him inside in that nickel weve played him outside in the nickel and weve played him at safety

3871542 those who fail to learn from the mistakes of history are doomed to repeat them
3871543 the basic assumption that god works out salvation within a special history that is also a part of general world history luke is intent to present the jesus event not as just another event in gods special saving history but as the event in that history

3871565 well you see its like this that older ox is the best ox that ive ever had he knows his way around the field the reason i put the younger one with him is so the that the older more knowledgeable ox could teach him how to plow if i never put them together the younger one would never learn by himself the younger ox would pull himself to death but together he learns to cooperate with and rest in the strength of the older ox

3871582 no one is going to buy a car company like this in the market that its in
3871583 one could argue is it worth as much as they paid for it initially based on todays market
3871584 so the bottom line is theyre holding on for the long term and well see what happens
3871585 i dont know what happens in three years or what he says in five years or whatever but those discussions we dont get involved in
3871586 what does it take to be a good and faithful servant of god
3871587 the earth is the lords and all its fullness the world and those who dwell therein
3871588 the silver is mine and the gold is mine says the lord of hosts
3871589 fig trees along with wheat barley grape pomegranates olive oil and honey were historically once the seven species of jewish diet these biblical seven species were the staple foods consumed by the jewish people in the land of israel during biblical times in biblical times the fig was eaten fresh or as a seasoning in addition to being used to make honey and alcohol it is also best eaten straight from the tree in the late afternoon after being baked naturally by the sun today fig is an expensive delicacy
3871590 a man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came looking for fruit on it
3871591 at this point theres nothing standing in our way of continuing to do what we said were going to do
3871592 all those things result in lots of other mechanical parts and bits and pieces that have nothing to do with electrical energy
3871593 such that the vehicle is not just a battery on wheels
3871594 itll have a similar set of visual cues and some of the features that were on the concept car
3871595 the program has all of those same things built in were just doing them faster because we have to
3871596 its an entirely different technology its an entirely different powertrain layout its a huge step forward
3871597 this and the other vehicles that are coming out in plug in form are for all intents and purposes because of some timing they are in a lot of ways prototype vehicles being put on the market to test
3871598 theres no doubt that general motors realized the importance of positive media coverage with the prius
3871599 its an opportunity to change the way we consume energy without significantly changing our lifestyle
3871600 master did you not sow good seed in your field where then did these weeds come from
3871601 god saw all that he had made and it was very good
3871602 you are always righteous o lord when i bring a case before you yet i would speak with you about your justice why does the way of the wicked prosper why do all the faithless live at ease
3871603 faith is defined as a living daring confidence in gods grace
3871604 the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of god ahead of you
3871605 if you are abrahams children do the deeds of abraham 39

3871608 jesus went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil because god was with him
3871609 when you give a banquet invite the poor the crippled that lame the blind

3871611 if you run around in frantic activity it will work out the poison
3871612 if you look at the bronze snake that has been lifted up on this pole you will live if you do not no matter what else you do you will die
3871613 do nothing just look how insulting a solution what part do we play in it
3871614 as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up
3871615 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit

3871619 doctrine is not an affair of the tongue but of the life is not apprehended by the intellect and memory merely like other branches of learning but is received only when it possesses the whole soul and finds its seat and habitation in the inmost recesses of the heart but it must be transfused into the breast and pass into the conduct and so transform us into itself as not to prove unfruitful
3871620 i dont get the excuses they make its almost insulting all theyd have to do was do the outreach
3871621 its almost as extreme as we couldnt find any black people for that position
3871622 a new blog apartheid within the democratic party setting a precedent for all future democratic national and state conventions
3871623 we were looking for people who were reacting to what was being written
3871624 the reality is that bloggers really havent gotten credentials in a major way before people are being critical and i dont understand where thats coming from
3871625 you just cant lob jim crow out there its crying wolf
3871626 were talking about people who can afford to buy a laptop and go to the convention this is not the same thing as sitting in at a lunch counter
3871627 i dont think raising the white guilt level is the way to go about it anymore
3871628 i dont think there was a conspiracy to exclude black bloggers
3871629 if you want your blogger pool to be diverse youre going to have to take extra steps to make that happen
3871630 ongoing discontent about a lack of inclusion in the white progressive blogosphere
3871631 to peter daou and the dailykos crowd there are no black bloggers
3871632 i was deeply disappointed because this is supposedly the face of the progressive blogosphere
3871633 and it cemented for a lot of bloggers of color that they didnt count
3871634 about as close to a meritocracy as you can get
3871635 while there are accomplished bloggers of color in the netroots too many bloggers are quick to use their sex or race to demand access that they may not necessarily merit based on what theyve built
3871636 there are going to be all those black grandmas and black grandpas who lived to see martin luther king and never thought theyd see the day
3871637 thats something that ought to be captured by black bloggers

3871641 while these data suggest the development of more favorable patterns of alcohol consumption over the latter part of the 20th century they also show that at the same time the cumulative incidence of alcohol use disorders has not shown a decrease and continuing efforts at preventing them are warranted

3871644 we belief that our results imply that in contrast to what has been previously suggested increased ger is not secondary to cough
3871645 patients with cystic fibrosis have a high risk for ger and gastric aspiration
3871646 and this seems to be associated with more cough and poorer lung function which suggests a deleterious role of reflux on cystic fibrosis lung disease
3871647 i think these business owners are mis characterizing whats going on
3871648 there is a remote chance that we have some sort of rogue sales person but i think that its more likely its just a business owner thats pissed off about reviews on his page
3871649 i have been studying for forty years which is forty years wasted i teach others and i know nothing this situation brings into my soul so much humiliation and disgust that life is unbearable to me
3871650 it is much worse yet when they ask me whether brahman was produced by vishnu or whether they are both eternal god is my witness that i dont know a thing about it and it certainly shows in my answers ah reverend father they say to me teach us how it is that evil inundates the whole world i am as much at a loss as those who ask me that question i sometimes tell them that all is for the very best but those who have been ruined and mutilated at war believe nothing of it and neither do i i retreat to my house overwhelmed with my curiosity and my ignorance i read our ancient books and they redouble the darkness i am in i talk to my companions some answer that we must enjoy life and laugh at men the others think they know something and lose themselves in absurd ideas everything increases the painful feeling i endure i am sometimes ready to fall into despair then i think that after all my seeking i know neither where i come from nor what i am nor where i shall go nor what shall become of me
3871651 arent you ashamed to be unhappy at a time when right at your door there is an old automaton who thinks of nothing and who lives happily
3871652 i have told myself a hundred times that i would be happy if i was as stupid as my neighbors and yet i would want no part of such a happiness

3871656 but on monday two reports surfaced suggesting that a softening of obamas stance may already be taking place
3871657 despite actively discouraging donors from giving to groups like progressive media at one point they are now taking the position that its nothing they have any control over
3871658 independent groups can talk to constituencies where the obama campaign or the dnc arent credible messengers the best example would be working america and its reach into white working class communities
3871659 there are some groups that are ready to take more donations working america votevets the choice groups and acorn to name a few

3871676 tucker and summers have operated their restaurants and managed their advertising from 2005 to the present to target distinct clientele both geographically and socio economically which eliminated confusion between the two sources
3871677 any possibility of confusion that has arisen has been resolved by cooperation between tucker and summers
3871678 the nassau bay restaurant has been falsely advertised as the new location of the beaumont eastex freeway restaurant that was closed in september 2005 by hurricane rita and that was owned by tucker and geneva broussard
3871679 defendants use of the sartins mark and variations thereof and false advertising associated therewith in beaumont and houston constitutes unlawful infringement of plaintiffs protectable trademarks and trade names and unlawful unjust enrichment to the detriment of the plaintiffs

3871683 the 3g coverage of t mobile is as good as the competition there can therefore not lie we suspect that it is a hardware software specific issue of the iphone itself
3871684 we are aware of the issues on the iphone 3g and were working with apple to provide a solution
3871685 there was some interest in converting syngas into ethanol during the first oil crisis back in the 70s
3871686 the problem was that catalysis technology at that time didnt allow selectivity in the byproducts they could produce ethanol but youd also get methane aldehydes and a number of other undesirable products
3871687 if we can increase this activated co adsorption on the surface of the catalyst it improves the opportunity for the formation of ethanol molecules
3871688 and if we can increase the amount of surface area for the catalyst we can increase the amount of ethanol produced
3871689 gasification to ethanol has received increasing attention as an attractive approach to reaching the federal renewable fuel standard of 36 billion gallons of biofuel
3871690 the great thing about using syngas to produce ethanol is that it expands the kinds of materials that can be converted into fuels
3871691 you can use the waste product from the distilling process or any number of other sources of biomass such as switchgrass or wood pulp basically any carbon based material can be converted into syngas and once we have syngas we can turn that into ethanol

3871695 we cant say whether or not the shark took a swimming young bear
3871696 we dont know how active these sharks are as predators
3871697 theres no possibility a greenland shark could predate a live adult white bear unless it was injured or seriously ill
3871698 greenland sharks do seem quite sluggish but they have been known to move very quickly when they are eating
3871699 both walruses and polar bears are powerful in the water both could handle most potential predators but not killer whales
3871700 the greenland shark simply cannot afford the risk of injury nor the expenditure of energy required to kill such a large and dangerous animal with or without the help of
3871701 for polar bears the greater risk is a loss of habitat these other things will be ancillary

3871736 our findings suggest that many former child soldiers may need more than interventions to reduce the mental health problems associated with surviving bombings and torture often they have to endure being stigmatized when they return to their home villages
3871737 these findings suggest that there is something else in addition to war trauma that is causing problems for the former child soldiers

3871755 if one or other of the companies is successful in securing a contract for training from the us defence department a contract could be signed with a successful bidder within the next few months
3871756 water is seeping in and pooling under the white latex coating that was supposed to protect these aircraft from the elements and preserve them in a saleable condition
3871757 the current market value of the skyhawks will be dropping daily especially given the further damage that will have inevitably occurred in the recent bad weather experienced by the marlborough region

3871829 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
3871830 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
3871831 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
3871832 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
3871833 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
3871834 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
3871835 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender

3871847 even family members can disagree about how this should be administered

3871849 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
3871850 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
3871851 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
3871852 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
3871853 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
3871854 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions

3871883 people back home dont know queen of the south and i cant afford for my players to think that
3871884 they will look to spoil our passing game and we are going to have to get used to the physical challenge
3871885 i know enough about scottish football to let my players know that its going to be very difficult because they will play with a lot of passion they will work hard
3871886 some of the queens players will have the feeling we might not get this chance again and they will battle they really will
3871887 that is different to what the boys are used to in denmark
3871888 so far i have been quite happy with our play but we didnt win and that puts a bit more pressure on us of course
3871889 you know we had a lot of guys throw a lot of pitches last night the chances are that after tonights game if everything goes according to plan maybe well make another move but well take it one at a time here
3871890 are making major life decisions on the basis of health care concerns
3871891 i actually woke up about 6 30 and was kind of grumpy and was thinking why we won
3871892 i dont know if too many of us can say weve been in games like that it was an interesting game

3871895 we saw looting with our own eyes they were taking household items loading electric heaters bicycles and carpets
3871896 if indeed russia is violating a cease fire and i have to say the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for the ceasefire that will only serve to deepen the isolation to which russia is moving
3871897 taking advantage of this lull we are reburying those killed in the georgian aggression
3871898 many were buried in a hurry just where they were killed in orchards and kitchen yards yesterday we recovered 18 decomposing bodies from under the rubble in tskhinvali today we found another four

3871907 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
3871908 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
3871909 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
3871910 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
3871911 if we start losing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish we could be in a whirlwind for bad things coming to the reef ecosystem
3871912 i look at last years team the team didnt make the playoffs its a lot of youth theres a huge goals for goals against differential
3871913 and i look at these exciting challenges i look at the team and the arrival of doug weight and mark streit the veterans coming back with bill guerin rick dipietro mike sillinger and brendan witt the future as far as the draft picks having 13 picks in last years draft alone and obviously the lighthouse project is something that looking at those plans it just looks like a tremendous opportunity and for me theres a huge light at the end of the tunnel that im excited about being a part of
3871914 during the process i had a set of guidelines that i was looking for in our next coach communication skills provide structure hold the players accountable a man of integrity character there were several different ingredients i was looking for
3871915 there were a lot of great candidates as the process unfolded scott it became clearer was the right coach for our team
3871916 i was very fortunate that in my time with providence one of the things that mike oconnell the general manager of the boston bruins stressed about our team in providence and it was maybe a change in philosophy after they won the calder cup in 1999 is he wanted his team to maybe play 10 games over 500 if you make the playoffs its a great year
3871917 but what i came to realize was that it forces your players to deal with adversity
3871918 when you have to deal with losing streaks your goalie getting hurt call ups as a coach you have to deal with that and you have to find a way to get your players to believe that they can win and have success as both individuals and as a team and for that reason what we did in providence the last five years we improved to the point where we had a great year last year with a team that nobody expected to have the success that they did

3871935 by the time the group of seven was established the artists had known each other for more than a decade working laughing talking and exploring canadas wilderness sharing their views and enthusiasm for the north they called themselves adventurers in paint and in a nation where the ambition of many other artists was to imitate the gentle rural scenes of europe they set out to be different

3871938 the last couple of times the home games have let us down a little bit

3871940 anyone that knows concacaf well will tell you theres four good teams in our group and i dont consider jamaica to be any less difficult of an opponent than the other ones were going to face

3871942 he cared a lot about education and regardless of what he needed to do he wanted to make sure all of us children went to college he made it happen he pushed us to go and made sure it was paid for if we needed anything he helped as much as he could my dad thought a good education was important regardless of what you ended up doing in life
3871943 i was a junior in high school and i didnt like school
3871944 i didnt want to go but he persuaded me i went for criminal justice im not using it right now but ive got the degree
3871945 he was successful in what he did but he still understood the importance of it
3871946 we were trying to think of a way we could give back to the community

3871959 intellectual property has never been more important to the success of high tech companies than it is today verizon is fortunate to have a significant and growing portfolio of valuable ipr intellectual property rights we believe that brian brings the expertise to maximize the impact of our ipr on verizons success
3871960 will be absolutely pervasive when i say everywhere i mean the individuals office the home the living room
3871961 one of the things weve found is that kids immediately take to it
3871962 i believe if the behavior of a student is disruptive the teacher should be free to discipline with out having to worry about retaliation we have a society of parents that are not doing the discipline hence it is left up to the school system
3871963 i believe that teachers should have immunity from litigation when punishing students and applaud governor daniels for once again thinking forward and improving indiana
3871964 for two generations dr spocks touchy feely concepts have swept through u s schools but this law may be the beginning of reversing this terminal damage
3871965 i think a teacher should be able to punish students as long as they dont go to extremes
3871966 parents and teachers want the same thing for the students if parents do their job of instilling values manners and discipline at home teachers could spend a lot more time teaching
3871967 its certainly not fair for students who want to learn to be subjected to a student who is acting inappropriately or disruptive in the class room
3871968 no way teachers should never get legal immunity for anything they do concerning someone elses kids they should be careful even when they do have to intervene i think the answer is clear policies and quality communication with parents
3871969 as an aspiring educator at purdue university i believe teachers should be allowed to discipline students within reason i believe governor daniels bill is a necessary evil in this case because without it the irresponsible legal system that we have today will see teachers getting into hot water for justifiably disciplining their students
3871970 teachers need to know that they have complete control inside their classrooms more often than not allegations against teachers arise because parents assume their child is always right and the teacher is at fault if parents did their jobs correctly teachers could do theirs
3871971 it is so unfortunate that we have for so long jeopardized the learning environment for students and teachers by taking away their authority to maintain a learning environment in situations of child misconduct it has caused a rise in disrespect and disregard for authority in the classroom we need to empower our teachers since we require them to do more than teach they are the parents while the real parents are at work but they receive more of the blame when chaos is in the classroom and for low test scores this will bring about the change long overdue to improve learning in public schools
3871972 i say yes it is a much needed action in the class rooms in order to help teachers to teach without rude interruptions
3871973 before a teacher can teach they have to have control of the students students need to respect their teachers
3871974 i think parents should be in control of their children and responsible for their punishment if everyone would take care of their children the way our parents did and know where their children are at all times this subject would not even come up
3871975 i believe that teachers should have the right to punish students by any means necessary most students do not listen to teachers anymore and therefore are not as comprehensive in class
3871976 as a long time teacher i can attest to the fact that teachers are afraid to touch any student for any reason when students are fighting you cant even step in and pull them apart without fear of being reprimanded or sued immunity would not only be well received it is absolutely necessary
3871977 teachers should not be immune there should be a limit to how far a teacher can go with a child and if that doesnt work then other policies should be set to deal with that problem but teachers should have the right to protect themselves and their students
3871978 shortly after leaving xprime defendent frost attempted to convert jardins inventions to his own by filing with the uspto patent applications in the distributed database architecture field the same subject matter as jardins intellectual property

3871989 if i could do it in the 200 it would be a dream come true but if i cant it will in no way be a blemish on my career
3871990 i didnt even know i had broken an olympic record
3871991 it reminded me that i am in the right place and not to stress
3871992 we have a very high percentage of baby boomers who will hit 65 in the next three or four years and then keep hitting 65
3871993 although we are not pleased with our results they were anticipated
3871994 as previously announced during the quarter we raised additional equity capital initiated several changes to our business model and began transitioning and realigning our business by adding significant institutional capabilities including fixed income research sales and trading institutional equity sales and additional capital markets capacity this transition required significant up front investments in systems occupancy and personnel during the quarter before beginning to realize expected revenue increases
3871995 during the quarter we also scaled back less profitable business lines filed with finra our request to consolidate our two brokerage subsidiaries to further reduce overhead and lower other costs and most importantly added key personnel who will lead our new business lines
3871996 it is a unique time within our industry in which we believe new leaders and firms will be built and we are confident that jesup amp lamont will emerge as one such firm

3871999 the conference offers great networking for distributors to discuss issues facing the industry including ways to reduce driving and shipping times through real time data transmissions built into the software
3872000 we are constantly looking at ways to boost the bottom line and save time
3872001 although our financial and operating results for the second quarter 2008 were below those of the comparable quarter last year they reflect a significant improvement from the first quarter results total second quarter sales were almost 80 higher and p25 digital sales more than doubled when compared with the first quarter of 2008 both of which contributed to a rebound in gross margins also considering the current uncertain economic environment we have taken steps to reduce our selling general and administrative expenses by approximately 1 4 million annually and 0 7 million for the second half of 2008
3872002 both quarters included higher than normal product development expenses reflecting initiatives to accelerate the introduction of our next generation kng line of p25 digital products the first product model in this line was completed and released for sale in june 2008 additional models will be introduced in coming months that will address frequencies and markets in which we have not previously had a presence once these models are completed we anticipate that engineering and product development expenses will return to normalized levels
3872003 many competitors are currently enduring a difficult business climate we believe however that relms broader line of new digital products with their competitive advantages combined with a reduced cost structure will strengthen and position relm for success going forward
3872004 alseres made solid progress in our programs during the second quarter
3872005 to strengthen our molecular imaging efforts we have added the expertise of dr thomas tulip previously with lantheus medical imaging inc formerly bristol myers squibb medical imaging enrollment continues to increase for the first phase of the altropane poet 2 program recently lundbecks partner teva pharmaceutical industries ltd announced the successful completion of adagio the phase iii trial designed to demonstrate that azilect r can slow the progression of parkinsons disease we believe that disease modifying drugs have the potential to significantly increase the use of altropane if approved we believe all of this has resulted in heightened interest from prospective partners in the potential for altropane to provide fundamental changes in clinical outcomes for the 11 million americans living with tremor disorders that are today misdiagnosed up to 35 50 of the time we also anticipate the initiation of the streamlined phase iib trial of cethrin we believe that if successful this trial will provide us with evidence that cethrin is more effective than a placebo in treating acute spinal cord injury
3872006 we are extremely fortunate to have mr santos join the board during this critical period of our companys development in brazil with over 20 years of experience mr santos will facilitate and expedite the completion of our production facilities and our ethanol export operation in brazil
3872007 we continue to be pleased with the strong earnings and cash generation that was achieved by troy over the past three months coupled with a continuing excellent environmental record and an excellent safety record by all employees troy has not had a lost time incident for over a year
3872008 plastics are one of the fastest growing engineering materials and autodesk is committed to providing customers with scalable attainable and cost effective digital prototyping solutions that help take their design productivity and innovation to new heights
3872009 we encourage anyone involved in plastic design not just current inventor users to try inventor plastic features and experience the benefits for themselves
3872010 our fourth quarter results reflect both progress and continuing challenges
3872011 we had a good revenue quarter reaching the upper end of our guidance and recording the highest quarterly revenues in the history of our company but we believe the market continues to show signs of softness and so we have taken decisive restructuring actions to resize the company in both of our business groups to enable the sustainable profitability and cash flows that investors expect from our combined ip businesses these restructuring actions along with the restructuring of our debt facility accomplished in the fourth quarter will when completed reduce our quarterly spending by approximately 5 million the write down reflects current market realities but our belief in the long term growth and strategic value of the chipidea analog business remains strong
3872012 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3872013 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3872014 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3872015 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3872016 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3872017 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3872018 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3872019 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3872020 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3872021 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3872022 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3872023 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3872024 i remember having many conversations with my agent amy berkower and a delightful conference call with her peter guber and stephanie germain
3872025 it felt as though we were on the same page so to speak right off the mark
3872026 finn was the one he was her soul mate he was her destiny he was all those things shed never wanted to believe in because they were all dorky as hell
3872027 ma che vuol dire non tutti i ciclisti fanno quella fine

3872029 meanwhile a giant restaurant erected by mcd at the end of the green has been far from packed
3872030 the adoption of appropriate information behaviour to identify through whatever channel or medium information well fitted to information needs leading to wise and ethical use of information in society
3872031 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3872032 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3872033 since yahoo wont let me in still i have decided to have a sale this sale is 20 off all orders

3872042 if successful this novel therapy administered only twice per year could help a large underserved population with late stage ms
3872043 mi expulsi n fue error m o porque hay un reglamento que es de fifa entonces yo pienso que la federaci n mexicana tiene todo el derecho de escribir su carta a santa claus que es el se or blatter y decir se or blatter estamos llevando al 100 por ciento su reglamento aquel entrenador como el tuca que hace tonter as est siendo expulsado y le cobramos veintitantos mil pesos y es cierto l stima que es nada m s cuando le conviene esta regla viene de fifa estamos de acuerdo la regla de que un jugador cuando termine su contrato es libre tambi n viene de fifa y por qu la federaci n mexicana no la lleva a cabo entonces nada m s cuando me conviene
3872044 es un reglamento de fifa como tambi n lo es el que dice que un jugador que termina contrato con su equipo es libre puede ir al equipo que quiera en m xico o fuera de m xico pero aqu no lo aplicamos entonces la cartita a santa claus blatter tambi n debe llevar postdata la otra regla que usted me dice que lleve a cabo no la estoy llevando a cabo porque no me conviene la de expulsar a los entrenadores y cobrarles veinte mil pesos s me conviene necesitamos una lanita para remodelar las instalaciones y las vamos a seguir est bien va a ser la nica coperacha que voy a hacer pero ojal que le digan a blatter que no est n cumpliendo con la otra
3872045 yo creo y tambi n mis compa eros dicen es que si estoy en una zona y no me estoy metiendo con el rbitro ni con el jugador contrario yo creo que podr an ser m s flexibles de repente sentimos la necesidad de hablar en la cancha ya no nos escuchan mucho y de repente te dice el cuarto oficial regr sate
3872046 la frase de que yo dec a que cuando se equivocaban era a favor no dec a nada y cuando era en contra tampoco dec a nada pues voy a tomar otra postura ahora cuando sea en contra voy a vociferar para quedar parejo muchas veces hasta se presionan los rbitros con comentarios que hacen varias gentes como dice la volpe
3872047 our ability to meet the more stringent listing qualifications for the nasdaq global market reflects the progress ses has made since listing on the nasdaq capital market in november 2007
3872048 we believe the move to the nasdaq global market will bring increased market exposure and liquidity to our shares
3872049 well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but ok its time to pass from this from words to deeds
3872050 we should realize what is at stake here for americans
3872051 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
3872052 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
3872053 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
3872054 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
3872055 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
3872056 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
3872057 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid
3872058 it is an honor to be recognized by an independent organization for our teamwork approach to quality safety and satisfaction that is producing results for our patients
3872059 we were one of only eight hospitals in new york state to be named on this list out of more than 2 800 hospitals nationwide we are very proud of this accomplishment
3872060 the board of directors and management of this company continue to take positive steps toward righting our course
3872061 we are in the process of evaluating and implementing a broad spectrum of beneficial strategies toward that end
3872062 as regards the public trading of our stock we began as an over the counter issue and our current management believes the otc arena is at this time the better fit for us after lengthy consideration our board and management unanimously agree that this is in the best interests of our shareholders
3872063 while there are benefits of an amex listing for companies that fit a particular profile we are realizing no particular benefit at this point in our life cycle
3872064 the direct and indirect costs of such a listing in terms of finance working capital human resources and time can be more efficiently managed as an otc company significantly this move allows us to more quickly and easily gain access to financing for working capital
3872065 we recognize that at first glance this move from amex may not appear to be positive to all
3872066 after thorough examination of all information before us however it is readily apparent that the added expenses relating to maintaining our listing status do not fit with current managements goal of concentrating all of our resources on building our business
3872067 we are committed to executing our business model achieving profitability and maximizing shareholder value as we continue to successfully execute our plans we will reconsider joining an exchange
3872068 were appreciative of amex and its staff for their service over the past several years
3872069 we believe we will ultimately regain compliance with listing standards regarding financial performance irrespective of our listing status
3872070 mi objetivo es mantener el estilo de este grupo desarrollarlo y potenciarlo porque es un grupo ganador lo m s importante no ha sido lo que ha ganado en la eurocopa sino c mo lo ha conseguido c mo ha disfrutado con ello y c mo lo ha transmitido
3872071 obviously well take everything into consideration well take time of day position of sun speed of vehicles that sort of thing
3872072 facing difficult technical and logistical challenges aero metric provided the minnesota department of transportation the u s department of transportation and the national transportation safety board timely valuable and accurate geospatial data that helped understand the cause of the bridge collapse assist in the response and recovery and prevent future tragedies their work was deserving of the mapps award and is symbolic of the kind of professionalism aero metric and other private sector firms in mapps carry out every day
3872073 as we mark the anniversary of this most tragic event i am honored to accept this award on behalf of aero metric we were proud to have been able to be of assistance to the teams of first responders as well as the minnesota department of transportation and the citizens of minnesota
3872074 sorry lil not you theres a heated argument going on over here about whether or not we should go to the nude beach the boys say yes but my wife and i say no way i dont think so
3872075 i found myself lying on her bed with what would become the ritual of her nails in my back followed by the gentle prodding of my anus
3872076 but not everything has been his fault at nashville he had a broken suspension and everybody thought he crashed so hes had some tough luck especially in places where he was going to be really good in the race
3872077 but for me where ive been really most proud is that probably 80 percent of the time this season the setups for all four agr drivers have drifted to what he developed and i think thats what has been really impressive last year at this time he was starting to get it down but if you look at where he was at the beginning of last year to where he is now its like two different people
3872078 im not sure i want to really be racing against marco
3872079 then its like a mixed feeling you still want him to do well but hes on another team
3872080 maybe it would be good for him in a way just because everybody thinks the dad thing that maybe hes being coddled and all that but i can assure you on this team its something i have to control myself because sometimes im too hard on him hes definitely not being coddled
3872081 we obviously want to be signed as soon as possible
3872082 this is where my heart lies with this team they brought me into the game its exactly where i feel at home and where i think i can do big things
3872083 theres nobody else i want to win with more than my father i think we have the resources within the team to allow me to follow through on my ultimate goals win the indy 500 and the championship and just win races
3872084 i was just asked the question would it be good for him to go and see another side another team maybe from the standpoint of growing and seeing the grass isnt always greener from that standpoint it probably wouldnt be bad for him to do it
3872085 but from the other side we really feel that hes on the verge of being a major player in every race i really believe that
3872086 hes got all the tools and its all starting to come together youd hate to lose that
3872087 i mean im already at the top as far as the top team in open wheel racing in america
3872088 if an opportunity would present itself in formula one the right one which im not sure would
3872089 it has to be one of the top three teams
3872090 we are pleased to report that we have completed the transition of paradigm to a pure play federal government it services provider with minimal exposure to small business set aside programs which originally comprised nearly all of our revenue base it has taken over 18 months to complete this task but through acquisitions and new business initiatives we are now well positioned to focus on our next set of strategic objectives which will focus on organic growth and strengthening the balance sheet we plan to bid more aggressively on new prime and subcontracts and expand our existing client relationships in the national security community and in key civilian agencies although revenue was relatively flat as we exited lower margin non core small business set aside work our gross margins increased substantially and our gross profit increased over 34 percent reflecting the success of our acquisition strategy and our emphasis on higher margin national security services
3872091 the acquisitions of trinity ims in early 2007 and caldwell technology solutions in mid 2007 provide us with a solid base of national security business the two acquisitions also bring new technical capabilities most notably trinitys cyber forensics expertise the completion of these two deals provides paradigm with new qualifications to bid on new programs as well as establishing the company as a national security platform from which to pursue similarly accretive and complementary acquisitions
3872092 revenue for the second quarter was 10 6 million compared to 10 7 million in the prior year while our gross margin increased over 498 basis points reflecting our focus on higher margin recurring contracts we are also now positioned to compete more effectively in the marketplace as a result of our broader capabilities the expansion of our business development team and the additional relationships brought on by our acquired companies at the same time we have maintained our financial discipline which we believe positions us for profitability as we achieve organic revenue growth and are able to leverage fixed costs going forward
3872093 while we had expected that the bigots and white supremacists would focus their anger on barack obama as the african american candidate what has happened is that both candidates are equally unacceptable to white supremacists who see them as being controlled and manipulated by the jews
3872094 in the warped conspiratorial worldview of the haters mccain and obama are equally tainted by the controlling hand of jews who they allege control the government and pull the levers of power in washington

3872115 enfrente tenemos un rival que en su campo nos va a apretar mucho y no va a ser sencillo
3872116 sab amos que tanto en la intertoto como en esta primera ronda los equipos espa oles estamos m s bajos que otros pa ses que han empezado a entrenar antes pero tambi n se supone que somos una liga m s fuerte y que debemos ganar el partido y pasar la eliminatoria sobre todo con el apoyo de la afici n
3872117 enfrente tenemos un rival que en su campo nos va a apretar mucho y no va a ser sencillo si todos venimos al campo pensando que va a ser f cil nos vamos a equivocar ya ese ox geno que todav a no est en las venas de los jugadores nos lo tiene que dar nuestro p blico
3872118 el rival es bastante bueno lo que pasa es que en la liga no anda bien seguramente porque tambi n estar a pensando en jugar la uefa ante un equipo espa ol y eso le pudo distraer un poco pero es un equipo inc modo que juega al futbol y tenemos que estar muy metidos y concentrados para pasar la eliminatoria
3872119 quiero ver esa sensaci n de equipo consistente de equipo que sabe lo que hace solidario que juega al futbol muy junto que no sea un equipo roto que tenga bal n que sea vertical y que llegue el resultado es importante pero hay otros aspectos que tambi n lo son
3872120 quiero que el equipo haga las cosas bien y que los mecanismos y el talento aparezcan

3872142 the dividend increase is indicative of the boards confidence in our continued progress toward achieving our goals and it provides a demonstration of that confidence to our shareholders
3872143 as we have previously stated we are planning for significant capital investments over the next few years to continue to provide reliable energy service to our customers this will require external financing with both debt securities and common stock issuances to maintain our equity ratio at an appropriate level we believe a solid dividend and its growth toward a dividend payout ratio more in line with the industry average of 60 percent to 70 percent are important in continuing to attract investment in our company
3872144 in the second quarter the chinese government announced the restructuring plan for chinese telecommunication operators whereby china mobile will merge with china tietong telecommunication and china telecom will merge with china satcom and purchase china unicoms cdma network while china unicom will merge with china netcom upon completion of the restructuring all three operators will be able to provide a full range of services covering both fixed line and wireless operations we believe that this will intensify competition in wireless operation and thus enhance demand for wireless coverage in addition the chinese government has announced that 3g licenses will be released after the completion of such restructuring which we expect will further increase product demand both in the wireless coverage market and base station rf modules market
3872145 currently the restructuring plan is being carried out step by step on july 28 2008 china telecom signed a final agreement with china unicom to purchase the cdma network from china unicom and china telecom subsequently disclosed that it would invest rmb27 9 billion in the first phase of cdma network construction at the same time china unicom announced that it will make a significant investment with the proceeds from the sale of its cdma network to build a high quality gprs network recently there have also been reports that china mobile is preparing for phase ii construction of its td scdma network in 28 cities we expect that these changes in the competitive landscape and the 3g rollout will bring us unprecedented opportunities in the coming period
3872146 furthermore we anticipate that the restructuring and 3g network development will drive additional growth in our rf business through increased demand from domestic base station manufacturers and additional growth potential brought by td phase ii construction building on our position as the major supplier of passive rf modules for huawei and zte we believe china telecoms cdma network construction and china mobiles td phase ii network construction will become the growth drivers for our rf business internationally we believe the overseas market will present new opportunities for us as we took a big step forward by commencing to supply small quantities of rf modules to one of the worlds largest base station manufacturers in the second quarter and became a qualified supplier of another large global base station manufacturer with whom we have now entered the product development stage all these will provide growth opportunities for our rf business going forward

3872272 our efforts in the first half of the year position virgin mobile to rapidly improve our growth trends
3872273 the operational improvements we have put into place are beginning to pay off

3872275 the acquisition of helio offers an excellent opportunity to expand our addressable market into postpaid and significantly increase the value we can provide our customers through new data services and feature rich handsets the additional liquidity and improved capital structure anticipated from the deal will benefit our business financially and strategically and we are looking forward to the closing of the transaction in the third quarter
3872276 definition of terms and reconciliation of non gaap financial measures

3872278 our strong performance in the second quarter demonstrates managements success in expanding aegeans logistics infrastructure and penetrating new markets in addition we once again utilized our disciplined approach to grow our global service center network with the acquisition of ics petroleum which closed on july 1 2008 and is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings and cash flows upon completing this acquisition which provides a critical bunkering presence in north america aegean has more than doubled its global network for the physical supply of marine fuel over the past two years complementing this robust growth we continue to significantly increase our delivery capacity with the addition of three double hull bunkering tanker newbuildings to date this year we remain on track to take delivery of 24 remaining newbuildings over the next two years under our well capitalized growth plan increasing our modern bunkering fleet to 52 by further expanding our full service marine fuel platform we expect to capitalize on the positive industry fundamentals and drive long term sales volume growth
3872279 our sound financial performance for the second quarter of 2008 was a direct result of our net revenue growth exceeding the growth in our operating and financing costs sales volumes improved significantly in our service centers located in greece singapore and the united arab emirates and we realized fresh volume contributions from our new service centers in northern europe the u k and west africa our enhanced sales volumes were generated during a period of record high marine fuel prices and as a result we drew upon our revolving credit facilities to finance the associated working capital requirements going forward we believe aegeans considerable financial flexibility combined with the execution of managements growth strategy bodes well for the company to continue to improve its operating leverage for the benefit of shareholders

3872415 i want to reiterate if the department of health and human services issues a regulation on this matter it will aim at one thing protecting the right of conscience of those who practice medicine from what ive read the last few days theres a serious need for it
3872416 several months ago i became aware that certain medical specialty certification groups were adopting requirements which potentially violate a physicians right to choose whether he or she performs abortion i wrote to the organizations in question protesting their actions frankly i found their response to be dodgy and unsatisfying i sent another letter more of the same not only are there clear provisions in three separate laws protecting federally funded health care providers right of conscience but doing otherwise undermines the most fundamental moral underpinning of freedom of expression and action i asked that regulations be drafted which would enforce these long standing laws protecting a medical practitioners conscience rights an early draft of the regulations found its way into public circulation before it had reached my review it contained words that lead some to conclude my intent is to deal with the subject of contraceptives somehow defining them as abortion not true the bush administration has consistently supported the unborn however the issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers the department is still contemplating if it will issue a regulation or not if it does it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner conscience many have provided comments on this subject and they will all be included under this posting

3872456 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3872457 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3872458 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3872459 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3872460 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3872461 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3872462 los dos presidentes han ordenado a sus ministros de asuntos exteriores que tomen las medidas necesarias al respecto empezando desde hoy
3872463 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3872464 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3872465 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3872466 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3872467 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3872468 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

3872470 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3872471 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3872472 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3872473 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3872474 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3872475 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3872476 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3872477 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3872478 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3872479 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3872480 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3872481 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3872482 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3872483 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3872484 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3872485 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3872486 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3872487 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3872488 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3872489 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3872490 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

3872496 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3872497 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3872498 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3872499 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3872500 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3872501 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3872502 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3872503 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3872504 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3872505 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3872506 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3872507 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3872508 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3872509 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3872510 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3872511 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3872512 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3872513 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3872514 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3872515 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3872516 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3872517 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3872518 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3872519 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3872520 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3872521 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3872522 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3872523 the good thing about the mandate is that it has a net no cost alternative for employers
3872524 our citys workforce use of this benefit pales in comparison to how many could be using it
3872525 it really goes beyond saving a few dollars for employers and employees its a city response to an energy crisis and also to the global environmental crisis

3872527 having the support of the organization behind it acknowledges that bicycling is a valid way to get around
3872528 weve been looking at ways to further green our business
3872529 one of things weve been looking at is transportation the idea came from someone relatively new who asked if we reimbursed for bicycle riding to the job site
3872530 most of the people that ride their bikes really are dedicated to it and really enjoy it if people are happier doing that its certainly a plus for everybody
3872531 the convention center was built on an agency basis which gave no risk to the construction manager and contractors and the sea bore all the risk
3872532 the underfunded budget and the unrealistic timelines those were really two factors that led to a lot of the engineering and construction mishaps
3872533 as we began planning to build our new arena we undertook just such a lessons learned review and have developed this project accordingly
3872534 there was a major problem at that convention center a major problem and somebodys got to be held accountable and these companies will be held accountable
3872535 is not ready to exercise its authority under article vii of the un charter and impose it
3872536 what he actually did was told off spanish ngos for what he said was supporting polisarios unreasonable aims he wasnt castigating the us or france or britain or the un for not fulfilling international law
3872537 his advice to the polisario is basically fairly scandalous its like telling a rape victim that she should lie back and enjoy it because there is nothing she can do about it

3872547 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
3872548 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
3872549 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
3872550 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
3872551 weve worked with russia in terms of the wto accession and they still have a ways to go so its not as though theyre close to it they still have some work to do before they get to it
3872552 we should convene other international forums to condemn this aggression to call for an immediate halt to the violence and to review multilateral and bilateral arrangements with russia including russias interest in joining the world trade organization
3872553 we are making progress on the last details of the negotiations i think it is important to finish this up
3872554 here you can download the rhode island lead defendants rebuttal of the states contention of sovereign immunity as well as the states argument that costs should be denied because defendants
3872555 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3872556 i have heard the russian president say that his military operations are over i am saying it is time for the russian president to be true to his word
3872557 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3872558 russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3872559 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3872560 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3872561 we have no need nor do we intend to take over any georgian air or seaport to deliver humanitarian aid for those caught in this conflict it is simply not required for us to fulfill our humanitarian mission we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
3872562 ive also been having conversations with senators obama and mccain
3872563 i know that they are at this moment of difficult diplomacy that they are doing what they can to support the efforts of the administration
3872564 if every single thing went extremely well id say that there is a chance he could play in a regular season game
3872565 theres just such a small window that i wouldnt say its likely but there is definitely a chance
3872566 if every single thing went extremely well id say that there is a chance he could play in a regular season game
3872567 theres just such a small window that i wouldnt say its likely but there is definitely a chance
3872568 with great reluctance and yet a sense of firm conviction
3872569 we have fully explored and exhausted every avenue for securing this funding in a manner that least affects californias budget and immediate cash needs

3872576 we need to discuss all issues concerning losses with the legitimate administration including the administration of this city and we cannot find anyone
3872577 how they were evacuated and what happened there is a mystery to us
3872578 we have no other choice because no other country came to our aid
3872579 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3872580 russia clearly sees the conflict as an opportunity to reassert dominance over an area that it views as part of its historical sphere of influence
3872581 russia clearly sees a unviersally recognized imperative to thwart us imperial encroachment on its neighborhood
3872582 hey george lets make another pipeline from russia through alaska right to the usa with some special price per barrel
3872583 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history

3872824 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas

3872876 yesterday the national commission of human rights called for the construction of a national front against organized crime worried because 99 of crimes continue with impunity the distrust of police authorities is reflected in the reporting of only 10 of crimes the procedures are inefficient and the penitentiary system is ineffective because of corruption
3872877 the worst is that chiefs and agents of the forces responsible for public security are involved in crime and that some of the heads of criminal groups direct operations from jail by way of cell phones or instructions transmitted through their defense lawyers the mess becomes more tangled every day
3872878 the political will is indeed lacking at all levels of authority to set aside their acrimonious quarreling and attend to what ought to matter most to us at this time

3872918 we failed in not disabling the code in the final release of update 2 and not catching it in our quality assurance process

3872923 as a vmware enterprise partner and vmware authorized consultant i can tell you this is a big deal for vmware to release a product that has such grave consequences for even a relatively small portion of the total vmware user population
3872924 this could have been prevented by not rushing an update to market which was intended to be free and compete with
3872925 this will cast doubt about the reliability of vmware in the enterprise

3872934 while different people use it to mean different things the broadest definition refers to any situation in which computing is done in a remote location out in the clouds rather than on your desktop or portable device
3872935 cloud computing represents a business evolution no less influential than e business
3872936 people are going to be quite busy with this load
3872937 you can be assured people are using the viewer to share information with partners customers and internally given the popularity of the office suite and how much businesses tend to use access
3872938 given that the vulnerability is web based and graphical you definitely want to pay some special attention to that one
3872939 it allows attackers to invite people for audio or video conferencing by impersonating a victim

3872954 theoretically if there was a problem with tracking students it should hit all students the same

3872967 georgia is a democratic government in the caucasus that has elected its leaders
3872968 to call it a project of anyplace of anybody perhaps belies more about the way russia thinks about its neighbours than the way it thinks about us policy
3872969 the georgian leadership is a special project for the united states
3872970 hes my first true love since rod and the age difference isnt an issue
3872971 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3872972 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that

3872976 the term food stamps has such a negative connotation for seniors
3872977 weve heard through speaking to them that changing the name would make it more attractive
3872978 the outreach that needs to take place will have to be managed in such a way that seniors who participate in the program wont feel stigmatized as they did with food stamps

3873230 robocalls conducted in violation of both federal and state law the night before the primary
3873231 this will reduce the risk faced by investors as under the existing system the issue price is decided far before the issue is made we will see if the process can be quickened further
3873232 price uncertainity is higher in such a system due to high volatility thus it has been decided that issuers can do qips at last two weeks average price
3873233 our attrition levels have reduced from 13 9 last year to 13 6 this year as hiring has slowed down across laterals and people are watching a wait and watch strategy
3873234 the attrition rate at infosys bpo was about 35 per cent last year and has reduced to about 28 per cent this year
3873235 we have been told nano is under too intense international glare to make it hostage to the political exigencies of any one state
3873236 the company is setting up the first and the mother plant for the tata nano at singur that it is a fully integrated facility comprising tata motors own plant and a vendor park and is working towards the calendar of starting production in the october december quarter of 2008 the entire car will be built at singur
3873237 if the deadline of early october is to be met it is impossible to manufacture components in singur
3873238 in that case we will supply components from outside the state
3873239 only the approvals are required but we have the capacity to be the major suppliers for equipment said p v kannan managing director of micromax systems which supplies control and instrumentation equipment for power plants

3873242 there is no slowdown in the economy there is no slowdown in infrastructure and new projects
3873243 the downside risk to our growth expectations in 2008 09 is primarily from a further deterioration in global conditions with its attendant impact on india be it in the sphere of oil prices or capital markets
3873244 if the prime ministers economic advisory council pegs it at 7 7 per cent i can confidently say it will be close to 8 per cent

3873255 you were trained on the job to do precisely this right
3873256 and from my year of working in a wafer fab i have begun to think that
3873257 many borderline cases are denied funding which leaves bereaved relatives in an intolerable position
3873258 any recommendations for funding from the coroner should be binding on the legal services commission
3873259 bereaved people who do not have access to a lawyer are likely to be seriously disadvantaged in such circumstances
3873260 even where families do manage to secure funding the levels can be inadequate and grossly disparate when set against the lawyers representing the other side
3873261 in many cases a lay family is simply unable to ask the necessary questions to represent their or the deceaseds interests at the emotionally difficult time of an inquest and the absence of available funding must mean that important questions go unasked
3873262 funding is only available if you can show a significant public interest and that is very very difficult to show you may have banks of solicitors and barristers paid for for instance by the ministry of defence which are all paid for by the taxpayer and the families of those who have died have no funding whatever
3873263 but on the continent the system is inquisitorial and everyone gets legal aid
3873264 we face real financial and regulatory challenges as we consider building a new nursing home
3873265 this purchase essentially buys us the time to carefully consider the financial feasibility of constructing and sustaining these services in the area
3873266 many of our elderly have lived in this town all their lives
3873267 they are part of the fabric of our community im glad the effort to bring nursing home beds back to the area is being investigated and considered by a local organization that cares about our community
3873268 to be successful we will need the support of corporate community state and municipal partners

3873282 this should send a strong warning to those who would undermine market integrity and undercut investor confidence for their own personal gain
3873283 while weve been favoring a dollar rebound in our view this has come a little bit too far too fast there are still significant headwinds for the u s economy and therefore some headwinds for the dollar
3873284 theres been a sell off in the yen crosses it has weighed on the euro and its certainly weighed on sterling
3873285 this decision was made as part of an ongoing strategic review of our portfolio and enables us to maintain our strong and stable financial performance by further paying down debt
3873286 i think of bela lugosi everyone said that he was creepy and that he slept in a coffin we become the image that others project on us
3873287 no one is going to buy a car company like this in the market that its in
3873288 one could argue is it worth as much as they paid for it initially based on todays market
3873289 so the bottom line is theyre holding on for the long term and well see what happens
3873290 i dont know what happens in three years or what he says in five years or whatever but those discussions we dont get involved in
3873291 were definitely in fear mode in the market this is a classic correction
3873292 youre going to get this sort of fear activity when theres very little conviction
3873293 this is a very difficult market in terms of processing news and trying to guess what is positive and what is negative
3873294 the way through this is to try to look at everything a little bit further down the road and just buckle up because its going to be a pretty wild ride
3873295 all these areas we controlled since 2003 but now they are coming and attacking and now they are in the control of the government
3873296 they are readying to move to other places the government is cheating us and cheating the international community they are going to destroy all the places to control them
3873297 government soldiers are shooting randomly in the area civilians have been killed and are missing some have fled
3873298 government forces and arab militia are moving north the government is conducting the second round of ethnic cleansing in northern darfur i call on the international community to stop the killing of civilians
3873299 the movement is still in pursuit of enemy forces at various locations
3873300 we took abby and shes been with us since said contreras
3873301 satellite images dating back to 1973 and old maps earlier than that show some 1 000 square kilometres of land have risen from the sea
3873302 a rise in sea level will offset this and slow the gains made by new territories but there will still be an increase in land we think that in the next 50 years we may get another 1 000 square kilometres of land
3873303 for almost a decade we have heard experts saying bangladesh will be under water but so far our data has shown nothing like this
3873304 natural accretion has been going on here for hundreds of years along the estuaries and all our models show it will go on for decades or centuries into the future
3873305 the land bangladesh has lost so far has been caused by river erosion which has always happened in this country natural accretion due to sedimentation and dams have more than compensated this loss
3873306 the truth be told there is no mole that means one thing

3873308 were happy that now were going to start seeing family reunions happen
3873309 it allows the children to be returned safely to their families and caregivers in a prompt and orderly manner
3873310 second the courts order ensures that the states investigation of abuse and neglect continues with strong provisions in place to prevent interference and ensure compliance by the parents the safety of these children remains our only goal in this case
3873311 what is not arguable is the fact that this court has failed to grapple with the questions of exceptional importance raised in this appeal
3873312 in the hope that the supreme court will resolve the issues of great significance raised by the case
3873313 no matter what the outcome of this case on its legal merits the judges call for full judicial review in a responsible and transparent manner has done much to help restore my clients and the publics confidence in the courts
3873314 it raises complicated difficult issues that really have not yet been answered by any settled body of existing legal precedent
3873315 my guess is if youve got a business where youre dealing with dynamite or nitro theyre going to hold you to a reckless standard if you do anything remotely off the protocol
3873316 but for something like a pool people drown in pools every day
3873317 it puts other people involved in commercial activities on notice that they could be held criminally liable in the conduct of their business
3873318 this is the first time ive ever heard of this rising to the level of criminal responsibility theres a lot of gray area in criminal law but these are things we wouldve never thought
3873319 i could imagine it would make people in the service industry whatever they do much more concerned about what their obligations and responsibilities are
3873320 there are going to be a lot of dueling experts its going to be a very difficult case to litigate depending on lionettis track record
3873321 theyre going to have to show actual knowledge on his part of the failure to take measures and i would be surprised without knowing all of the facts if this goes all the way
3873322 this is just a show trial to accomplish the purpose by scaring people
3873323 prevent another horrific incident like this from happening to someone else
3873324 those who knowingly violate pool safety codes designed to protect children should be held accountable for their actions
3873325 i know first hand how state implemented gun laws hurt legal gun owners not the criminals
3873326 i opened up my gun shop against the advice of a lot of people selling guns isnt a lucrative business because of the countrys feelings toward guns
3873327 ill bet somebody brings suit against the state of connecticut as a result of the courts ruling
3873328 as far as the supreme courts decision we dont expect any impact for connecticut
3873329 what this ruling means is that connecticut can continue to do what it needs to do to prevent unnecessary gun violence
3873330 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
3873331 undoubtedly some think that the second amendment is outmoded in a society where our standing army is the pride of our nation where well trained police forces provide personal security and where gun violence is a serious problem that is perhaps debatable but what is not debatable is that it is not the role of this court to pronounce the second amendment extinct
3873332 we cannot put a price on public safety but these resources will go a long way to help ensure the security and peace of mind of the citizens of connecticut

3873342 you can negotiate better prices for raw materials which are prohibitively expensive you get a better bargaining position relative to your customers and you have greater financial strength to invest in new tooling new products

3873435 the tree so far out stripped all competitors in the manner of growth that it might fairly be said to represent a new type of vegetation on this account and in recognition of the sundry other anomalies i named them

3873439 if you cant stand how someone smells you cannot become intimate
3873440 a womans response to a mans natural body odor will be colored by her feelings for him
3873441 so if you fell in love with a man online it would be hard to be repelled by his smell

3873452 we do not need nor do we intend to take over any air or seaports in order to deliver humanitarian assistance to those caught in this conflict

3873503 bowling is something that most people see as an activity they can do in their hometown
3873504 when you think about the pro football hall of fame in canton or the national baseball hall of fame in cooperstown you think of heroes to be admired and a sport that is not something you can aspire to

3873515 i am looking forward to working with john macfarlane and returning to the
3873516 you can argue that it was the highlight of his career he had been treading water for eight or 10 years
3873517 he said he was fearful of doing television because aside from the ed sullivan exposure television had been a fiasco for him
3873518 he said television is not my turf im not comfortable in a

3873520 i was amazed by all the energy enthusiasm and fun going on after a hard days work
3873521 there was no plan at all i mean absolutely nothing
3873522 he didnt know what he was going to do i knew he was going to pull out some of the old songs wed done that kind of thing but that was it
3873523 this is supposed to be like an informal section of the show where we faint or do whatever we want to do especially me
3873524 he was in control swapping his acoustic guitar for moores electric and stomping his feet through bluesman
3873525 because he hadnt been touring he had gotten into the movie thing i know his feeling was im getting back before the public this way

3873542 of singular importance in these discussions is the rich cosmological worldview of confucianism which promotes harmony amidst change this is an invaluable perspective for seeing nature as intrinsically valuable and for understanding the role of the human in relation to natural processes as critical
3873543 confucian ethics in its most comprehensive form relies on a cosmological context of the entire triad of heaven earth and humans
3873544 heaven earth and humans are the basis of all creatures heaven gives them birth earth nourishes them and humans bring them to completion heaven provides them at birth with a sense of filial and brotherly love earth nourishes them with clothing and food and humans complete them with rites and music the three act together as hands and feet join to complete the body and none can be dispensed with
3873545 what do you say to killing unprincipled people for the sake of principled people
3873546 sir in carrying on your government why should you use killing at all let your evinced desires be for what is good and the people will be good the relation between superiors ch n tzu and inferiors is like that between the wind and the grass the grass must bend when the wind blows across it
3873547 what do you say concerning the principle that injury should be recompensed with kindness
3873548 with what then will you recompense kindness recompense injury with justice and recompense kindness with kindness
3873549 virtue is not left to stand alone he who practices it will have neighbors
3873550 let the will be set on the path of duty let every attainment in what is good be firmly grasped let perfect virtue be accorded with let relaxation and enjoyment be found in the polite arts
3873551 the superior man is modest in his speech but exceeds in his actions
3873552 the superior man is distressed by his want of ability he is not distressed by men not knowing of him

3873554 a scholar whose mind is set on truth and who is ashamed of bad clothes and bad food is not fit to be discoursed with

3873574 youll never see politics or information on any of these networks
3873575 if we had no news division it would be important to show that speech
3873576 theres no telling when it will happen again it certainly hasnt happened before
3873577 its important for our viewers to be able to see both sides
3873578 hes been pretty courageous about going into places where he wouldnt expect to have a lot of support
3873579 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
3873580 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
3873581 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
3873582 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
3873583 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
3873584 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
3873585 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender

3873588 were concentrating right now on making it as big as possible and getting the service used
3873589 here the proposed draft was provided we politely reviewed it said thanks but no thanks and ultimately decided to go another way
3873590 this is a good old boy system that is killing the rights of consumers
3873591 to say we have been in collusion with someone over this brief is not correct and unfair
3873592 we are not taking a side the governor hopes that the people deserving of medical monitoring receive the medical monitoring that they need
3873593 governor manchin just showed us hes more concerned with big business in west virginia than with the health and well being of our families and children
3873594 maybe governor manchin should come here and try to explain his actions
3873595 just the simplest things bother me allergies a runny nose on a daily basis it worries and bothers me
3873596 might feel different maybe if his own family members were involved
3873597 the governor made his own judgment based on the issues
3873598 and his office wrote and filed their own brief with the west virginia supreme court
3873599 this is a high profile high dollar case so i can imagine that feelings and tempers may be fairly high
3873600 but from our point of view it is not unusual for this governor or other governors to participate in matters that are before the courts that have a direct impact on west virginia it is certainly not indicative of corruption
3873601 we let her stay here and now shes blaming everything on us
3873602 they smile at you while they dig a grave for you behind your back
3873603 he controlled what they ate what they did he controlled pretty much everything
3873604 i asked did you go to help and they looked at me like it was the strangest question dad pretty much did whatever he wanted to do
3873605 the victims of this type of abuse theyre made to believe theyre not worthy of anything that this is what they deserve
3873606 its amazing they were not allowed outside they were simply not allowed to go near the door it all goes back to the control thing
3873607 i think its just hitting her what she is going through
3873608 he came in and went into this office and started shooting
3873609 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3873610 our thoughts and prayers go out to chairman gwatney and his family and we pray for his full and speedy recovery
3873611 while the investigation of this shooting continues and our primary concern remains with bill and his family we commend the courageous and speedy action of law enforcement officials in apprehending the suspect
3873612 hes in very critical condition the family is doing the best they can theyre shocked like the rest of us
3873613 you never think of something like this happening here in arkansas
3873614 this is like something you would see in new york or pennsylvania or california but not here
3873615 were aware of it were helping the state police right now
3873616 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3873617 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well

3873623 youd better hold on to the headboard because i think this could be a real rough ride
3873624 youd do bondage with any woman whod let you get away with it
3873625 they didnt love me theyd have adored any woman you brought home theyd have groveled at my feet even if i showed up in a rhinestone cowboy hat and hooker heels and had kin in jail
3873626 exactly three weeks hardly a lifetime yet we fell right back in bed together as if we were well as if we were a couple when there are still dozens and dozens of unsettled things between us my life is here yours has been in europe im a practicing catholic youve got an allergy to religion you come from money and you have money im beyond broke im into guilt and thats not a small thing i could wear you down over the long run you could find me exhausting tedious im trying to say honest to pete will we really dont know enough about each other to be sure weve got anything long term going on we dont have to be in a rush
3873627 im afraid youre all mixed up its the guy whos supposed to say why be in a rush im supposed to be the one who talks you out of using sucky words like commitment and long term and all that
3873628 youre in sex with me and im definitely in sex with you too but im not positive weve got the scary four letter word going for the long run
3873629 maybe it isnt but i think sex is damned important
3873630 so do i with you and actually that means that a little stretch of abstinence could be a lot of fun
3873631 abstinence is never fun and it could never be fun with you assuming its even possible
3873632 this was the plan remember when we were on the boat and you wanted to seduce me in broad daylight
3873633 close enough and because i thought it was such an excellent idea i thought i should enable you i mean if you want to get into this sin and fantasy thing you should have a willing accomplice its the guys job in a relationship to help the woman achieve her dreams my sisters read that to me from a womans magazine so i know it must be true
3873634 im finding two hard things one is harder than the other but one definitely seems to feel like a small square box
3873635 yeah thats the one i was trying to tell you about the other things for you too but i think wed better go inside first dont you
3873636 will you be my bride my wife share life and love with me
3873637 i will if youll be my husband my mate my love through life
3873638 we can but we dont have to travel to do that
3873639 with comparable performance to gpus on the market at that time
3873640 it is needless to say my social life is practically nil and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life
3873641 she got to the point where she could joke about it
3873642 ill never forget the old japanese man who couldnt speak english so he decided to feel for himself if i was real
3873643 at guinness there were days when i felt like i was doing a freak show
3873644 when that feeling came too often i knew i had to come back home

3873650 since the website is essentially the gateway to the new film pirates ii stagnettis revenge it was imperative to create a site which conveys the sexiness and immense budget of the film
3873651 it was also important for the website to allow easy access to all things pirates pirates ii stagnettis revenge is more than just a movie its an experience and we want everyone to be able to participate
3873652 its amazing how easy it is for stores to get a hold of pirates banners and wallpapers for their website homepages
3873653 even better stores can contact me or craig and request us to add a link to the banner so that when a customer clicks on the banner it takes them directly to the sales page
3873654 theres even a countdown clock on the webpage so stores should start to get their orders in as soon as possible this is the biggest adult film in history and copies will fly off the shelves on september 27
3873655 my favorite part of the site is the video section well be updating the page every week with a new behind the scenes featurette the film is phenomenal and so i believe that people will be really excited to see how we reached the finished product the cast and crew had so much fun with each other constantly laughing and playing jokes

3873727 coveted assignments for presidential debate moderators were handed out last week and guess who was left off the list again after suffering the bitter and unprecedented blow during the democratic primary season of having candidates refuse twice to appear in fox news sponsored forums when bloggers raised hell about the news organizations lack of legitimacy rupert murdochs news channel was again left off the list of news anchors tapped to moderate the must see tv events in the fall instead the questions during the three presidential forums and one vice presidential debate will be posed by pbs jim lehrer and gwen ifill as well as nbcs tom brokaw and cbs bob schieffer unlike the primaries fox news this time wont be locked out entirely all the networks will be able to broadcast the debates but the snub means that once again fox news will be denied the chance to leave its imprint on the all important debates it wont be able to build its brand on the back of democrats who have injected extraordinary passion and interest into the white house run that passion and interest has helped boost ratings for fox news cable competitors while foxs numbers have remained stagnant meaning the unfolding presidential campaign has been a ratings dud so far for fox news and its unofficial year of woe

3873757 forget the fact that developers pay all road costs within their subdivision and most times are saddled with impact fees outside their projects
3873758 must reasonably reflect the expected impacts directly attributable to the subdivision
3873759 may not exceed a proportionate share of the costs incurred or to be incurred by the governmental entity in accommodating the development
3873760 developers then turn the road over to the appropriate government agency what a deal a free road
3873761 i will use ota long before i go back to twc
3873762 i guess i couldve phrased my response better im glad that you and others have great pq and are happy with uverse but my experience has been terrible
3873763 i turned around to my dad and said thats exactly what i want to do
3873764 he goes its not how many times you get knocked down but its how many times you get back up and go forward carl latz said his son told him
3873765 and i told him thats exactly what this is all about and if nothing else this letter just taught you a life lesson
3873766 well the law prohibits it and the legislature enacted the laws to protect the health safety and welfare of all children
3873767 it seems totally unbelievable that somebody would even go to that extreme to send a letter to somebody let alone looking to find something about child labor laws
3873768 if my doors close and i never open again and this boy becomes successful then i will be the happiest person in the world
3873769 its strange that a kid at this age would glean onto this particular kind of music and show the intensity and kind of the ability to function as kind of 8 year old blues guy
3873770 it would be unusual to find an 8 year old who can play joe satriani licks
3873771 ive had more people tell me they say its a kids body but it has a 70 year old dude inside
3873772 i think its so much you can do on the guitar
3873773 any regulation of carbon dioxide is going to be controversial because its going to raise energy costs
3873774 with permits you can trade with a wide variety of entities to achieve the lowest cost solution
3873775 some people say taxes are better because an uncertain price hurts firms
3873776 their argument is that if a firm doesnt know what the price is going to be its harder for the firm to make decisions regarding capital investments and r amp d
3873777 firms deal with uncertainty all the time they buy inputs that have volatile prices
3873778 electric utilities for example face uncertain coal prices they use financial instruments to deal with that uncertainty
3873779 initially the permits may be thinly traded because people are trying to figure out what the right price is
3873780 power plants participating in the program reduced sulfur dioxide emissions 22 percent 7 3 million tons below mandated levels
3873781 probably the greatest green success story of the last decade
3873782 you couldnt just take the sulfur dioxide program and plop it down for greenhouses gases but i thought it would work well for a variety of reasons
3873783 something like 70 percent of the sulfur dioxide emissions came from electric utilities
3873784 there were other sources too but congress decided that itd get a big chunk of the emissions from regulating the utilities and that it was going to let the other 30 percent go thatll happen with carbon dioxide well look for the big chunks that we can get in the lowest cost way
3873785 so theres a great legal environment to enforce the property rights associated with tradable permits and there are enforcement bodies that can litigate to ensure compliance
3873786 so to solve the issue you need a global program and theres no uniform regulatory body that governs the world
3873787 the thing to keep in mind is that you can create a demand for products that cost more but have environmental benefits attached to them
3873788 kun manageri vaihtui tottenhamissa vastuuni v heni huomattavasti viel enemm n p t kseen vaikutti ett en p ssyt oikeastaan lainkaan pelaamaan omalla paikallani keskikent ll jouduin aika paljon t ytemiehen rooliin pelasin siell miss milloinkin tarvittiin

3873842 i probably wont remember what you say to me i may not even remember what you do for me but ill never forget how you make me feel
3873843 yes we lost but i think in the last two rounds the judges based their decisions on the dominance of batshegis opponent in the first two rounds i still feel that batshegi could have been given more points especially in the last two rounds
3873844 they are very good technically batshegis opponent was technically good in that he took the lead in the early rounds and then decided to protect the lead until the end
3873845 we want to stick to our latest deadline of closing all temporary shelters on friday we will clear everything and we dont expect that there will still be people there after the closure
3873846 we dont want to see women and children sleeping on the side of the road we do anticipate that one or two people might refuse to cooperate but we have a contingency plan in place
3873847 a team comprising of community development workers cdws councillors and mecs visited the different shelters to inform the displaced people about the closure of shelters

3873853 it is bound to be the case there will be a quarter or two of negative growth
3873854 oil prices are at the highest level in real terms at any point in the post war period apart from the late 1970s and weve also seen the biggest financial dislocation since the second world war
3873855 what is unique about the present set of circumstances is that both shocks have happened at the same time and the combination has meant that life is extremely difficult and will be for the uk economy over the next year
3873856 as both the government and the bank of england have recognised the uk like other economies is seeing the consequences of globally high energy and food prices we know the impact that this is having on people here and will continue to support families and business through these tougher times
3873857 this report gives added authority to other forecasts which suggest next year will be truly dreadful with no growth and inflation running higher than at present levels we can expect to see a squeeze on living standards and rising unemployment
3873858 the bank of england is undoubtedly right to hold out the prospect of improved conditions in two years time providing that interest rate discipline is maintained
3873859 however it is very difficult to see how a weakening government with minimal political authority is going to stagger though next year when economic conditions are deteriorating this report reads like an obituary for gordon browns economic credibility
3873860 i dont think were facing anything like the sorts of circumstances which led households back then to find it very difficult to service their mortgage payments

3873894 please order me a course of iv roids im willing to do anything so i can feel better and be stronger for work
3873895 for 63 years i had no reason to believe i would ever find out what happened to my father
3873896 i virtually had no hope of ever knowing what happened to my dad
3873897 i wouldnt say ive processed it i think im still a little shell shocked by it all
3873898 i think they kind of grasp what is going on
3873899 i dont know that the military even looked for him

3873901 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3873902 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3873903 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3873904 there are confused reports and varying reports that are coming in
3873905 were doing our best to keep up with them and to best understand the situation its not the easiest thing in the world given the geography and the cutoff of information
3873906 russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century the united states has supported those efforts
3873907 now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3873908 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project

3873921 it seems unlikely that wild birds have carried the strain to africa since the last migration of wild birds from europe and central asia to africa occurred in september 2007 and this years southerly migration into africa has not really started yet
3873922 this increases the risk of an avian influenza spread to other countries in western africa
3873923 many countries have succeeded in getting the virus under control but as long as avian influenza remains endemic in some countries the international community needs to be on alert

3873925 the georgian leadership is a special project for the united states
3873926 at some time it will be necessary to choose between the prestige of this relatively virtual project and partnership on questions that require collective action
3873927 all of these years georgia has been armed notably by the united states
3873928 russia has warned many times that our american partners and other countries are playing a dangerous game that the potential built with the help of the united states and other countries could be used in dangerous adventures

3873931 we believe in allowing nature to take its due course
3873932 i know our customers wouldnt support us if they knew we were knowingly accepting products from clones or their offspring
3873933 the lack of effective governmental oversight and tracking could mean consumers will lose the ability to choose clone free products
3873934 that would help ensure changes to federal policy are done in a manner that maintains consumer confidence and informed decision making
3873935 meanwhile the federal government should exercise its authority and expertise to determine an appropriate regulatory framework including traceability and labeling

3873952 many people were familiar with king or sockeye salmon but did not know a lot about coho that changed after they tasted it coho has a delicious taste profile and many of our guests said it was one of the best tasting salmon they ever had theyve been asking about it since then
3873953 we are very excited about the opportunity for the oceanaires guests to try alaska coho salmon this year
3873954 many diners may not be aware that alaska is home to five different species of wild salmon all of which have their own unique flavor profile color and texture
3873955 after seventeen years in the landscaping business i am ready to explore new ventures and i am confident im leaving the company in good hands
3873956 gw equity worked closely with me to secure an appropriate buyer and establish an exceptional deal for myself and my employees
3873957 from the first meeting we were confident that the buyer was a good match
3873958 we are pleased that we have a deal that benefits both parties and serves the business so well
3873959 dispatchers should not be subject to discipline for using their judgment to help the captain determine the appropriate fuel load for a given flight
3873960 any attempt by airline management to inappropriately influence or intimidate the dispatchers is extremely misguided
3873961 we are concerned about what appears to be a drive toward minimum standards by our airline and others
3873962 until now american airlines has never been an airline that has been satisfied with meeting only federally mandated minimums
3873963 its hard to imagine that our airlines management would consider doing anything that further compromises our operational reliability they should instead be focused on finding ways to serve our customers better
3873964 you can argue that it was the highlight of his career he had been treading water for eight or 10 years
3873965 he said he was fearful of doing television because aside from the television had been a fiasco for him
3873966 wed start shooting at 9 or 10 in the morning and go until we were done then hed go into his living quarters and invite friends and theyd jam to all hours of the morning
3873967 i was amazed by all the energy enthusiasm and fun going on after a hard days work
3873968 there was no plan at all i mean absolutely nothing
3873969 he didnt know what he was going to do i knew he was going to pull out some of the old songs wed done that kind of thing but that was it
3873970 this is supposed to be like an informal section of the show where we faint or do whatever we want to do especially me

3873976 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
3873977 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
3873978 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
3873979 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
3873980 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
3873981 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
3873982 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
3873983 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
3873984 autism may frighten people because so little is known about the disorder
3873985 the cause has not been scientifically proven and the victims often act in ways society doesnt understand
3873986 im an advocate for my child but we all have to play on the same playground
3873987 its not about clearing the playground so my child can be on it
3873988 were talking 50 to 60 oreos he didnt understand the effect it had on the entire class
3873989 certainly there are cranky people in this world if a mother glares at your child for something thats really pretty harmless quite honestly thats her problem
3873990 but if your child is going to have a meltdown i dont think its in anybodys best interest to bring the child along
3873991 they usually really do care but they have to weigh the considerations of others
3873992 but i would disagree with anybody who thinks they did that casually or it wasnt important to them
3873993 i have to be careful because sometimes hell do a fast movement or run

3873998 the counterfeit games designed to look good from every angle
3873999 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
3874000 our president may have gone there just to watch the games the chinese leadership does not take that view
3874001 they want to send a message the message of flawless execution
3874002 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
3874003 this is pretty unfair for the girl who was not picked to perform live
3874004 this girl has a great voice and they should recognize that she deserves to be seen she should definitely perform at the closing ceremonies
3874005 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
3874006 the right information has to be given to the people
3874007 i saw two people park a motorcycle next to this building there was a package about this big on the back of the bike
3874008 i thought this was strange and went over to check it out the people who parked the motorcycle suddenly jumped into a red volkswagen and sped off
3874009 the police shot and killed eight terrorists they captured two and two others blew themselves up
3874010 the police rescued 13 trapped residents and seized 10 homemade bombs three suspects remain at large
3874011 but one thing we know about terrorists is that while they may be few in number and primitive in their means they can often achieve sensational results
3874012 this is an ethnic minority region our customs should be respected we should be trusted

3874028 we were able to accomplish this level of internal improvement despite the softness in the u s economy and the sharp rise in commodity prices

3874036 i told him if you go over there now your heart has to be in it i felt davids best chance to play at the next level was at defensive back davids a big strong physical guy with good hands and feet just seeing him over there at cornerback his first year you could tell he had the potential to be an nfl defensive back

3874040 hes got the tools one thing hes worked on is overcoming bad plays were all going to get beat but youve got to shake it off and get ready to play the next play hes a senior now a veteran guy and i think hes better equipped to be able to do that than he was as a freshman
3874041 shortly after leaving xprime defendent frost attempted to convert jardins inventions to his own by filing with the uspto patent applications in the distributed database architecture field the same subject matter as jardins intellectual property
3874042 at datallegro defendant frost used and incorporated jardins intellectual property into datallegros products
3874043 this is a very small industry and we all know each other turbochef has had a relationship with middleby for a long time
3874044 the benefit with convertible debt is that you dont have to price the deal usually for an angel the company is too new for the angel to put a valuation on the company
3874045 a lot of the best returns on angel investments historically have been made in downturns
3874046 they all ask the same question how long were you married and when you tell them 52 years they say isnt that wonderful but i tell them no it isnt i was just getting to know her

3874051 our teenagers should be sitting in on adult conversations bible study classes congregational prayer and church meetings they should be learning about theology and church life they wont be able to handle all of it but theyll be able handle much of it the church is not responsible to make cute churchgoers but to make disciples our largest mission field is our own children teenagers whom we must teach to obey all that jesus taught
3874052 so have your midnight bowling trips and laser tag nights but make sure your teenagers know thats not church even if you mention jesus at snack time make sure they can distinguish the fleeting excitement of pizza night and the eternal excitement of the churchs worship the greatest threat to our children teenagers is not boredom for which entertainment is the remedy their greatest threat is their sin for which the gospel is the remedy they need rescue from their narcissism to life in community they dont need a christian alternative to the worlds entertainment they need the alternative to hell and where else will they find it but in christs church

3874076 it is important that investors understand that this use of cash in no way reflects a changed view around the many opportunities for growth that we see in front of us we continue to believe we are exceptionally well positioned to execute on our growth strategies while moving forward to benefit from our advantageous stock price
3874077 we have overcome significant difficulties from permitting issues last year and water problems this spring to bring the mcwatters mine into production soon we will be able to extract development ore from the mine and will work diligently throughout the fall to prepare for full production in late 2008 or early 2009 although the current price of nickel is a concern for all producers our cost to produce a pound of nickel will be approximately us 3 50 less metal credits as we hit our production targets we anticipate the hart mine to come on stream in the second half of 2009 and we do have the option to increase the production rate at mcwatters this could significantly increase cash flow in 2009 even if nickel prices remain at current levels

3874079 i did the mathematics the frequencies and the fiction i imagined the discovery but i never built the machine
3874080 do you believe in other dimensions spirits angels because your idea is very plausible you know you see the catholic church has real hands on experience with this kind of activity and the machine that you described in your book it just might work
3874081 well thats sci fi go where no man has gone before
3874082 yes go where no man has gone before thats not exactly accurate you see we take spiritual activity very seriously in the catholic church have you had a signature tour for your book yet
3874083 no not that famous but there may be a chance just before christmas according to the publisher
3874084 i see there is actually some concern by some of my colleagues about some readers response to your ideas since you described your pyramid machine in such detail there can be a lot of young people who might decide to try and copy it
3874085 well i dont think itll work at all just a figment of my imagination shouldnt cause too much of a stir in the spirit realm
3874086 andrew do you know the scriptures christs words about his victory over satan
3874087 those scriptures were written somewhere between forty and seventy ad do you remember what happened about three centuries later with the roman emperor constantine
3874088 constantine had a vision a vision of the cross of christ and because of that he was eventually baptized into the church it was then that the spirit realm became very important to the church you see the spirit realm is real and it exerts a great influence over humanity over all the affairs of men unless theyre christians of course little by little the rebellious realm was mostly conquered over a period of time it took great effort and organization and this was possible because of the power that christ gave to the church over the forces of darkness so as various christian nations continued to conquer pagan peoples or explorers discovered new peoples the church baptized more and more people into the church and the spirit realms were pretty much put under our control
3874089 what are you saying father frank you mean the spirit realm was somehow tamed by the catholic church
3874090 yes mostly but the protestant reformation started to open the scriptures to everyone and things started to go out of control again
3874091 oh no religious offense the church either catholic or protestant isnt the problem but during the middle ages people began to experiment and they used the scriptures to explore the spirit realm that has been a problem ever since and now that your book has come out we are anticipating some possible new activities from adventurous minds
3874092 a private burial service for our children ben and catherine was held earlier today

3874104 it appears that these rewards did not affect students motivation to prepare good postings

3874173 its important for our viewers to be able to see both sides
3874174 these allegations of election fraud are paranoid fantasies the republicans and their friends in the voting machine industry wouldnt dare fix a national election such a conspiracy would be too massive to keep secret and once it came to light it would destroy the gop
3874175 and resolve to take big steps one at a time in humble and small way in unison to put our mother land pakistan on the path envisioned and charted by quaid e azam mohammed ali jinah
3874176 england became power with only a population of 35 million pakistan could become one of the most powerful states economically
3874177 equitable taxation levied in a manner consistent with social justice
3874178 allow us to have a state as good as any in the world and better than many sovereign countries on the map of the world today
3874179 an opposition party or parties are good correctives for any party which is in power
3874180 it is with feelings of greatest happiness and emotion that i send you my greetings august 15 is the birthday of the independent and sovereign state of pakistan it marks the fulfillment of the destiny of the muslim nation which made great sacrifices in the past few years to have its homeland
3874181 at this supreme moment my thoughts are with those valiant fighters in our cause pakistan will remain grateful to them and cherish the memory of those who are no more
3874182 the creation of the new state has placed a tremendous responsibility on the citizens of pakistan
3874183 muslims of india have shown to the world that they are a united nation their cause is just and righteous which cannot be denied let us on this day humbly thank god for his bounty and pray that we might be able to prove that we are worthy of it
3874184 this day marks the end of a poignant phase in our national history and it should also be the beginning of a new and a noble era
3874185 to the freedom loving tribes on our borders and the states beyond our borders we send our greetings and assure that pakistan will respect their status and will extend to them its most friendly co operation in preserving peace
3874186 today is jummat ul wida last friday of the holy month of ramazan a day of rejoicing for all of us wherever we may be in this vast sub continent and for the matter of that throughout the world
3874187 finally let me tell you fellow citizens pakistan is a land of great potential resources but to build it up into a country worthy of the muslim nation we shall require every ounce of energy that we possess and i am confident that it will come from all whole heartedly
3874188 i know there are people who do not quite agree with the division of india and the partition of the punjab and bengal
3874189 pakistan has lapsed into languor a spiritless lassitude a sense of guilt shame danger and anxiety hangs over the country like a pall it appears as if we are on a phantom train that is gathering momentum and we cannot get off today pakistan is a silent mournful land where few people talk of the distant future and most live from day to day they see themselves as ordinary and unimportant their suffering too common to be noted and prefer to bury their pain pakistan is in a deep deep hole when will it follow the first rule of holes when you are in a hole stop digging unfortunately the hole pakistan has dug itself into is really really deep the problem for us is that you feel you are in a hole and you want to get out and you hear all those noises and all that activity but you feel very much alone with no one out there really wanting to stretch back to you and help you out the country suffers from a malignant disease but people think it is just a cold so they continue taking small does of medicine and wonder why it still hurts
3874190 to all who care about pakistan our country has come a long way since its independence

3874232 they shot the shopkeepers who dealt with them so it was rare to see iranian chocolate or anything else with the partial government control by the shia especially in the last six months shopkeepers are now allowed to deal in iranian goods

3874302 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3874303 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3874304 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3874305 i have heard the russian president say that his military operations are over i am saying it is time for the russian president to be true to his word
3874306 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3874307 we understand that the united states is worried about its project
3874308 either support for a virtual project or real partnership on issues that really demand collective action
3874309 not only those who commit atrocities are responsible but so are those who fail to react in a way russians are fighting a proxy war with the west through us
3874310 the border has been along this river for 1 000 years
3874311 there are issues related to taking full advantage of the speed of a flash drive
3874312 the more interesting way is to have it built into the operating system
3874313 i dont think it gains much traction because i dont think users want to sit there and start selecting what goes where
3874314 it was a valiant effort by intel to accelerate the move toward solid state on pc
3874315 use storage space on some removable media devices such as usb flash drives to speed up your computer
3874316 when you insert a compatible device the autoplay dialog box will offer you the option to speed up your system using windows readyboost
3874317 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3874318 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3874319 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3874320 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3874321 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3874322 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3874323 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3874324 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3874325 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3874327 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3874328 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3874329 just follow each of these steps and you the democratic party establishment can help elect john sidney mccain iii to a four year extension of the bush era
3874330 michael moore has endorsed you but he recently said fill in the blank with some outrageously offensive line taken out of context will you still accept his endorsement or do you denounce him
3874331 youd come out here to the wall and pretty much like i said it looked like a chalkboard
3874332 i guess it was working for a good three months and we got this order to comply notice and we cant fight with the city
3874333 my standpoint is that theses kids taggers gang members they respect the local artist that we hired and it was working
3874334 were going to be researching some of my resources in our district to see how we can provide resources for the antonios and put up a mural that both the establishment the actual store and the neighborhood could feel good about
3874335 were in that part of the summer where volume tends to be light conviction tends to be minimal

3874340 we all want this movie to go into production as soon as possible
3874341 its a fast tracked movie lionsgate felt the process was enhanced by having a second team come in and do a script
3874342 fans expect these types of movies to be more true to the source material
3874343 theres no reason there couldnt be a conan movie every two years hes almost like batman hes a dark hero hes a hard hero he has to be badass but we also have to like him
3874344 this stan dubin guy does provide a lot of really helpful information im sure his ebook will be a great value as well
3874345 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
3874346 battle for the heart and soul of the republican party
3874347 the palestinian side will only accept a palestinian state with territorial continuity with holy jerusalem as its capital without settlements and on the june 4 1967 boundaries
3874348 you know the guy who built the multi million dollar equniox amp ams empire
3874349 we do not mention mr gouldds name in this business unless you are already in even then this business is all about his wife not him we do not want the focus to be about bill gouldd infact i can already tell that you are a avid follower of bill gouldd so because of this ill have to tell you that this business isnt for you
3874350 let me see if we can do that on the iphone
3874351 i will have to check and see if the iphone can have unlimited text messages
3874352 1 o qual no voc pode ouvir algumas m sicas
3874353 estive at muito tarde a trabalhar num ensaio um texto longo que vou enviar em breve para um jornal ingl s
3874354 we decided earlier in the year that given the current ad climate this wasnt the time to roll out a second issue
3874355 no es comprensible que a m s de tres a os de ocurridos los lamentables hechos el estado mantenga en el abandono a stos muchachos que como muy pocos en chile optaron por hacer su servicio militar proceso en el cual vieron en tr gicas circunstancias morir a sus compa eros y amigos
3874356 la misma presidenta bachelet se comprometi a apoyarlos no s lo con ayuda sicol gica sino que adem s con viviendas y trabajo
3874357 el 95 por ciento de los 77 sobrevivientes siguen con secuelas sicol gicas sin la debida atenci n y el 50 por ciento est desempleado y sin oportunidad de salir adelante
3874358 esto parece demostrar que las autoridades se acuerdan de ellos s lo para la conmemoraci n de la tragedia y para salir en los medios de comunicaci n alabando su valent a
3874359 no puede ser que la respuesta del gobierno a sus demandas sea la formaci n de una mesa de trabajo y nuevas promesas de ayuda cuando a lo que requieren son soluciones en el corto plazo
3874360 what i was hoping for with him and what i got is that he didnt use anything as an excuse
3874361 he put it all upon himself he didnt use the way the coach used him or injuries or being young when he came in the league none of that
3874362 he took responsibility for himself and really once he did that for me it was easy thats one of the biggest things to get athletes to hold themselves accountable whether he did that when he was 18 or 19 im pretty sure i was mature at 18 or 19 but i wouldnt have been ready to be thrown into a no 1 pick or right into the nba and handle that kind of responsibility whether he acknowledged responsibility at that time didnt really matter to me the fact that now he does is the only thing i want to judge him on
3874363 we praise god for the glorious grace he has poured out on us
3874364 the grace of god was poured out on me abundantly along with the faith and love that are in christ jesus
3874365 im proud that i am georgian and they hate us because we are georgian
3874366 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
3874367 join our european partners in direct high level diplomact with both georgia and russia
3874368 che un giorno il mio cuore la smetter di cercare di uscirmi dal petto ogni volta che mi sfiori
3874369 a esa se ora le vamos a dar una casa
3874370 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
3874371 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
3874372 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
3874373 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
3874374 probably the biggest lie told in schools though is that the way to succeed is through following the rules
3874375 y por qu no trasladas esos ficheros a otro lugar que te lo permita
3874376 be sure that your host machines date and time are set correctly
3874377 the issue was caused by a piece of code that was mistakenly left enabled for the final release of update 2
3874378 very serious side affects sic that could impact production environments any virtual machines that sync time with the esx host and server time sensitive applications would be broken these include but are not limited to database servers mail servers amp domain administration systems
3874379 except of course in the very unlikely event that the software determines it has expired
3874380 and then regardless of where your license server is youre screwed
3874381 we belief that our results imply that in contrast to what has been previously suggested increased ger is not secondary to cough
3874382 patients with cystic fibrosis have a high risk for ger and gastric aspiration
3874383 and this seems to be associated with more cough and poorer lung function which suggests a deleterious role of reflux on cystic fibrosis lung disease
3874384 this was proof of principle in patients who had failed the standard therapies and had few if any remaining options
3874385 while these data suggest the development of more favorable patterns of alcohol consumption over the latter part of the 20th century they also show that at the same time the cumulative incidence of alcohol use disorders has not shown a decrease and continuing efforts at preventing them are warranted
3874386 io credo che da qualche parte vaghino le anime irrequiete
3874387 los dos presidentes han ordenado a sus ministros de asuntos exteriores que tomen las medidas necesarias al respecto empezando desde hoy
3874388 its good to be heading home and taking on the broncos again
3874389 ill be looking to come out of the game better than i did earlier this year but im definitely looking forward to it
3874390 im excited and more than ready to play this friday night
3874391 i knew when i came to the dragons i needed to be patient and ill be giving it my all on friday night
3874392 being able to rejoin wayne next year will be great
3874393 ive got a lot of respect for him so it will be good to be back together at the dragons
3874394 i really do feel part of the defensive group and i really do enjoy playing down there
3874395 this year unfortunately through a few injuries ive had to be thrown all over the ground that hasnt been a bad thing
3874396 hopefully ive been able to add a little bit to the team and a little bit of versatility to my game im happy to be playing in the team in any sort of role
3874397 leo is such a fantastic player it is difficult to cover someone like that but weve adjusted quite well
3874398 theres a few different players shouldering a bit more of the load and being given a bit more responsibility to some of the younger players like heath grundy
3874399 they are very versatile in their forward line with leading players who can take a pack mark theres players who are great on the ground
3874400 theres not one player that you can actually concentrate on because they are all very dangerous
3874401 the overall spread of goalkickers makes it hard for opposition teams to match up on them
3874402 i look at shane crawford and theres no doubt he was ready to finish a few years ago but now he just plays his part in the side but he can see theres a premiership not far away
3874403 they are things that would make you want to keep playing
3874404 i always thought you know at 28 that i had the chance to come back but the last few years theres been some trying times
3874405 but i always felt that if i didnt have another injury id get there but i sort of look back as a whole at my career and wouldnt change anything form injuries wins and losses its just been a fantastic journey since 1995
3874406 i might have said no earlier in the year but this time next year if its going like it is now id say yeah im ready to go again
3874407 yes apart from a lingering ache you dont tend to move on until you get a chance to perform again
3874408 it was a very good performance by the all blacks and there were elements that we werent proud of or happy with but its not the end its not terminal
3874409 theres likely to be some adjustments i dont know what they are fully yet myself
3874410 he is quite a positive person and i think its rubbing off on the boys it was a pretty positive camp this morning and we put it behind us
3874411 it was a bit of a freak accident it was supposed to be an eight week injury but it has turned into a four week injury with surgery
3874412 i will only miss one game so im pretty fortunate
3874413 troy university has always been interested in providing opportunities for young people to better themselves and this is a situation where a young man who has made some mistakes is looking for a second chance
3874414 i have met with josh and i am convinced that he is ready and willing to do the things we need for him to do to be a productive member of both this football team and the troy university community

3874498 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3874499 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3874500 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3874501 cautious and uncertain consumers are watching their wallets and with the back to school shopping season under way that does not bode well for retailers
3874502 i think there are too many negatives and the negatives are too large for a gasoline price decline to change the story significantly
3874503 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3874504 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3874505 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

3874507 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3874508 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3874509 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3874510 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3874543 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3874544 i joined the unit more or less agnostic on drugs policy being personally opposed to drug use but open minded about the best way to deal with the problem he wrote on the blog i was certainly not inclined to decriminalise however during my time in the unit as i saw more and more evidence of what works to quote new labours mantra of the time it became apparent to me that enforcement and supply side interventions were largely pointless they have no significant lasting impact on the availability affordability or use of drugs

3874549 were talking about senator domenici representatives pearce and wilson here in albuquerque and we want to make sure that theyre held accountable as well
3874550 held sen pete domenici accountable for rubberstamping bushs failed policies 92 percent of the time as well as reps steve pearce and heather wilson who voted in lockstep with bush 91 percent and 66 percent of the time respectively according to congressional quarterly
3874551 they want to distance themselves from him and our point is you cant distance yourself if you voted for his policies and they need to be held accountable as well
3874552 wished it would be in a more prominent place where more albuquerqueans could see it
3874553 the negotiations are good negotiations and that is going to continue

3874556 its not surprising that tom suozzi is trying to defend david patersons tax gimmick after all it was suozzis idea but suozzi is dead wrong to say the governor has been personally attacked david paterson has been around long enough to know whats personal and whats about policy
3874557 heres whats personal the impact on 3 million kids around the state if the governor and the legislature enact a property tax cap that devastates public education it will be personal for the families whose children go to school in overcrowded classrooms it will be personal for the teachers who are fired it will be personal for the homeowners whose property values will go down with the quality of their local schools
3874558 in bearing with imperfections of life we ought to be far more considerate for here the descent is very slippery and satan ambushes us with no ordinary devices for there have always been those who imbued with a false conviction of their own perfect sanctity as if they have already become a sort of airy spirit spurned association with all men in whom they discerned any remnant of human nature
3874559 there are others who sin more out of ill advised zeal for righteousness than out of that insane pride like cathari donatists and anabaptists when they do not see a quality of life corresponding to the doctrine of the gospel among those to whom it is announced they immediately judge that no church exists in that place this is a very legitimate complaint and we give all too much occasion for it in this most miserable age and our cursed sloth is not to be excused for the lord will not allow it to go unpunished seeing that he has already begun to chastise it with heavy stripes woe to us then who act with such dissolute and criminal license that weak consciences are wounded because of us for where the lord requires kindness they neglect it and give themselves over completely to immoderate severity indeed because they think no church exists where there are not perfect purity and integrity of life they depart out of hatred of wickedness from the lawful church while they fancy themselves turning aside from the faction of the wicked
3874560 what does the holy apostle the instrument of the heavenly spirit by whose testimony the church stands or falls do about this
3874561 no one is going to buy a car company like this in the market that its in
3874562 one could argue is it worth as much as they paid for it initially based on todays market

3874659 there was some interest in converting syngas into ethanol during the first oil crisis back in the 70s
3874660 the problem was that catalysis technology at that time didnt allow selectivity in the byproducts they could produce ethanol but youd also get methane aldehydes and a number of other undesirable products
3874661 if we can increase this activated co adsorption on the surface of the catalyst it improves the opportunity for the formation of ethanol molecules
3874662 and if we can increase the amount of surface area for the catalyst we can increase the amount of ethanol produced
3874663 gasification to ethanol has received increasing attention as an attractive approach to reaching the federal renewable fuel standard of 36 billion gallons of biofuel
3874664 lockheed martin is already a leader in the research development and application of nanotechnology to future military and intelligence applications

3874667 we are very pleased to join lockheed martin and look forward to applying our carbon nanotube technologies to a broader array of programs and customer requirements this will enhance capabilities for our customers and provide exciting opportunities for our exceptionally talented employees
3874668 the problem we have faced in the past is producing enough of these coiled carbon nanotubes at a reasonable cost to make a difference
3874669 because our current method produces coiled nanotubes quickly in high yield it can be readily scaled up to industrial levels after formation the coiled nanotubes can be peeled off in one piece and placed on other surfaces to form instant cushioning coatings

3874684 redefining certain forms of birth control as abortion is an unreasonable interpretation of basic contraception and family planning

3874691 princess cruises has long stood for romance and reconnection and so were delighted to have trista and ryan christen ruby princess as they celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary
3874692 while slightly unconventional their courtship and marriage was exciting to watch as it unfolded and we think their fascinating love story epitomizes our inaugural theme of celebrating romantic moments and milestones
3874693 were incredibly honored to be invited to be the godparents of ruby princess
3874694 its hard to believe that its been five years since we got married this is a wonderful way to celebrate our wedding anniversary and also to remind people about the importance of marking not only the key milestones in a relationship but also making time to incorporate romance into our everyday lives we are so excited to be part of this once in a lifetime opportunity

3874698 i think its going to be one of the great conspiracy theories like whether we landed on the moon or whether lee harvey oswald acted alone
3874699 there are a lot of people in science who are weird or unstable
3874700 i dont consider myself among the hardcore conspiracy theorists that this is a total cover up it looks more like bungled investigation
3874701 these are people with what appears to be a potential significant motive
3874702 were i an fbi agent i would be investigating them to see whether they actually had means and opportunity to carry out an attack like this
3874703 they didnt decide to pin the job on bruce ivins after they sent out the anthrax letters they had already decided on using him beforehand
3874704 as dangerous as it could possibly be and also deeply mysterious
3874705 its almost a generic aspect of conspiracy theories that some of the most important witnesses or the fall guy for that matter think lee harvey oswald is now dead because they cant contradict or complicate a conspiracy theory

3874708 ive kind of given that up now and i just play along

3874711 lance lives a life im not at all familiar with

3874713 i had started having some pain in my hips for a few months but im kind of a self confident person and thought i could diagnose myself
3874714 i would ice my joints and take anti inflammatories and just push through
3874715 my doctor said i needed to stop running and quit doing impact sports and i handled it real well
3874716 i went home and told my husband my life was over my husband is a funny guy too he suggested my life wasnt over i was just going to have to join the real world and get myself a job
3874717 i could win a gold medal and people on the street would still ask me about lance
3874718 i know that these countries they need help all kinds of help and when you come to a developed country i had the chance to train in good universities like mcgill universitys surgery ive been working in an excellent hospital here in sherbrooke and i feel it is my obligation to give some time and expertise to these poor populations

3874721 the lhc is a particle accelerator which has been built deep underground in a 27 km tunnel under switzerland and france

3874724 i believe there is less control in truth in advertising in the spanish media than the english media because ive seen these outrageous claims being made about vitamins and other products
3874725 but i am actually very impressed with the spanish media in terms of their news coverage they have a built in commitment to getting out a lot of information on health issues especially with diabetes
3874726 when asked about why they lack a usual provider 41 percent say the principal reason is that they are seldom sick
3874727 the pool of individuals who are u s born and have insurance still make up a huge number

3874743 the arguments were fairly convincing regarding the need to reconsider the specific versus general abilities conclusions

3874750 the territory must be proactive and enact legislation which would increase the territorys regulatory authority and demonstrate our commitment to establish a sustainable brownfields program in the virgin islands
3874751 the economic development authority recognizes the importance of the enactment of the brownfield revitalization and environmental act
3874752 the authority stands ready to establish a stated policy with regard to eliminating public health and environmental hazards on existing commercial and industrial land in the v i for use and reuse of sources of employment housing recreation and open space areas
3874753 we are mindful of the rising costs of fuel and the impact it is having on wapas cash flow and by extension on each of us in terms of our monthly electricity bills
3874754 i am also mindful of the need to balance wapas financial survival with the financial constraints we face as a community in terms of supporting our many critical needs
3874755 what we want to achieve is a higher standard of living
3874756 the development proposed by the applicant would epitomize the new urbanism principle of walkable neighborhoods
3874757 when you look at the islands a big issue is watershed maintenance projects like this help maintain water quality
3874758 looks like its going to be an interesting party race
3874759 it is truly an honor for us to be doing this again
3874760 we look forward to continuing to support the club and its children
3874761 the boys and girls club is much more than just the territory
3874762 the club is open to all children in the community and the price is very affordable
3874763 this is to protest the irresponsibility and neglect of reparations by the usvi government and to demand that appropriate attention be given to the issue of denmark slavery and repair
3874764 other groups have gotten their appropriations either in part or in full and we have gotten nothing
3874765 this is hampering the local efforts to advocate and seek repair and continue reparations dialogue
3874766 some appropriations have been funded partially but we certainly cannot release any funds unless we realize supporting revenues
3874767 acrra has chosen to fast instead of to fight and to pray rather than to provoke
3874768 there is just no money there to support the release at this time
3874769 there were sit down talks with accra and the governor in june that the money will be released when it is available and since then nothing has changed
3874770 i have lived life to the fullest and encourage you to do the same
3874771 you have made a wonderful choice in coming to the university of the virgin islands
3874772 the change you will see in yourself and that your parents will see in you will be tremendous
3874773 we want the local people to continue to monitor it as they should with every system this time of year
3874774 sometimes the switch just goes on and all these systems start developing
3874775 we do see in general there are signs its getting busier
3874776 even though we dont expect this to develop very much its a good time to make those preparations for the rest of the hurricane season

3874781 i think there is still a strong stigma against hiv
3874782 and there is still an unwillingness to accept the seriousness of our hiv problem here in the virgin islands
3874783 i thought it was one of the first times that we probably really and truly addressed some of the concerns of the clients
3874784 i think since that point we really havent had major major problems with the adap program for our clients
3874785 this is not just a vicare issue its not just a hope issue its not just a department of health issue
3874786 its really a collective issue that impacts the entire community
3874787 if youre not using a condom in an area with one of the highest concentrations of hiv in the country the risk is high
3874788 we potentially will see a lot higher numbers in the future
3874789 this finding builds on existing research that reports a link between childrens sensitivity to rhythm in the spoken word and their reading ability
3874790 my experience in higher education has equipped me with an understanding of curriculum development student and client services and the importance of attaining high standards of quality
3874791 many of the programs that we offer through cell are targeted to individuals who wish to enter the work force secure a better position or who seek professional designations
3874792 one of my goals is to assist our families by sharing with them new concepts of how to get their young people interested in career paths and how to keep that interest through the duration of their grade school learning
3874793 if you give us just a fraction of what you have been doing on this board then we are well on our way
3874794 if there werent a problem there wouldnt be anything for me to solve and if there is nothing for me to solve i wouldnt have volunteered to serve
3874795 once i get into the studio im going to rip off all of my clothes sit down and starting playing the violin
3874796 i have been studying the instrument for the past 10 years and its very exciting to play before a live tv audience tonight though i am a little nervous
3874797 propane is highly flammable and with that amount of propane it presented a very serious situation
3874798 the battery backup lasts only so long so the whole network went down
3874799 all islands were affected because the network is controlled over on st thomas
3874800 ever since i got here i have just been wowed because being in an environment with all these great athletes you see what its really all about what it takes to get here and the kind of performances that will happen
3874801 the way everything is set up athletes dont have to worry about anything everything has been thought about down to the last detail the olympic village has just been calming and also exciting at the same time
3874802 its very spacious and never crowded there are ample implements to use at your pleasure
3874803 the people are out there watching and cheering us as we warm up and practice they are in awe because we came from so far to compete in their country
3874804 its bringing me back to a phase where ive been as a junior just happy to compete hungry for it again
3874805 there were no hammer or javelin throwers there and they said the ring was open and i was about to start throwing
3874806 then this lady on a futuristic scooter came and told us i couldnt practice because it was time for another event
3874807 ive had a decent season and i cant take anything away from it after coming off a year of rest and injuries
3874808 i spoke to my coach mike maynard in the states and he said dont try to go out there and win it just go out there and try for a personal best i intend to stay loose and go for that personal best
3874809 ive been to a lot of regattas where there have been a lot of people from different countries but the camp is more diverse because theres only two from each country there are a lot of people who dont speak english or understand what youre saying but its fun
3874810 a lot of the things we thought were electronic were people coming out of the ground it was crazy all of the stuff they did without electronics
3874811 i think it would be really really cool to be in the parade and not just watching it from the crowd
3874812 i like the whole feeling of the olympic village and everything is there the food court is nice the facilities are there and the people are nice
3874813 this has motivated me especially coming here and seeing all these athletes and seeing the type of treatment they get versus what other people get it inspires me to come and participate in these sports
3874814 to come as one of the athletes this experience inspires me to want to do more in my training and my competitions instead of just focusing on bigger meets
3874815 everything that had to do with the opening ceremonies was impressive
3874816 weve done some fun activities and went to the olympic games opening ceremonies which was the most incredible thing ive ever experienced in my life
3874817 at the camp ive played football and done different sports
3874818 there are a lot of people out there that all have similar dreams of coming to the olympics and youve to work harder to get where you want to go
3874819 i never knew of places like the cook islands or the solomon islands and im learning about them now so its exciting
3874820 ive been playing tennis basketball netball and doing hula hoops
3874821 no no i give you special price just for you
3874822 look it has the great wall on it i give your for 100 you so nice
3874823 youre selling me and want me to put my price
3874824 lawd it was 3 400 now it down to 1 500
3874825 you are a special customer you purchased over 200 rmb
3874826 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
3874827 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
3874828 co operation ireland has been very successful in a conflict situation for the last 30 years but the context has changed out there and the challenge will be to be as equally successful in the next 30 years of co operation ireland in a different context
3874829 youre in a peace building context people have this view that the peace is done and its all over and to some extent that part of the conflict is over but its by no means stable yet yes a lot of the engagement has been at the top political level but actually the grassroots hasnt been engaged in it
3874830 all of that political agreement needs stabilised and needs underpinned at the grassroots level which is what peacebuildings about in some ways the peace making is a pragmatic enterprise whereas peace building is much more vision oriented its not about single events its about process and a process that will take years and so the context becomes more difficult
3874831 international land border here which no other police force in the uk has
3874832 no one has gone public to say the army council has gone away
3874833 what i can say with absolute certainty is that in terms of pira activity that is to say terrorist activity its not happening
3874834 does it mean all the provos have gone into nine to five jobs of course it doesnt there are some involved in organised crime without a doubt but operating as individuals not operating as an organisation and i think thats the key distinguishing factor
3874835 on the other side of course it must be hugely frustrating to those who dont have that confidence
3874836 so i can understand i think the unionist community are going to look for a lot more than just a statement that pira have gone away before they are satisfied but we are not seeing activity
3874837 it pira has reduced in size but it is there
3874838 the organisation is dedicated to following a political path but it will not disband to the point where it could not carry out an operation if it needed to
3874839 anyone who can help us prevent this type of activity should come forward to the police
3874840 those responsible for planting these devices show a callous disregard for human life
3874841 those responsible seem intent on following their own selfish agenda and the only way for communities to be free from such activity is to help officers bring these criminals before the courts
3874842 there was no claim of responsibility but dissident republicans were suspected of being responsible the devices were being examined
3874843 formal consultation on equality impact assessment eqia of northside urban village draft regeneration framework
3874844 the dup was relentlessly trying to interfere in the uup tory talks and would not be ditching its support and links with the order
3874845 party policy for the rest of the uk has to reflect different situations in other regions unlike northern ireland most parts of gb do not have a selection based post primary system therefore party policy has to reflect different local circumstances
3874846 enceladus has got warmth water and organic chemicals some of the essential building blocks needed for life
3874847 we have quite a recipe for life on our hands but we have yet to find the final ingredient liquid water but enceladus is only whetting our appetites for more
3874848 unfortunately from a republican perspective there are two different jurisdictions and two different economies and two different realities on the island
3874849 the major question historians will ask is not why the republicans surrendered but why they fought such a futile long war
3874850 it has not been unconditional surrender and it has been infinitely better than continuing to fight a futile war for the sake of honouring irelands dead yet producing only more of them but let us not labour under any illusions that the conditions were good
3874851 residents have to use it and make sure that illegal activities dont come and take over
3874852 i love la valle i am going to die here
3874853 when we grew up we were taught about hard work and that is what has paid off today
3874854 it was a long nagging trip and i didnt receive my luggage so im hoping to get it tonight
3874855 im fine though i feel no aches or pains i slept a bit on the plane and i dont feel bad because im used to traveling and having delays not like this though but ive got to stay calm be patient and hope for the best
3874856 i got the work done and im confident going into my races
3874857 in 2004 i had just gotten out of college with no experience and went into the olympics blind not knowing who my competitors were
3874858 but this time ive competed with all of the best competitors in track so i wouldnt be as nervous and ill be more confident in myself my races and my coaching i know what i have to do
3874859 i have to execute properly and thats what ive been training to do over the last couple months
3874860 she needed a lot of rest because these olympics are her second time around so records have to be broken
3874861 whether its leeward islands records u s virgin islands records something has to be broken and finals have to be made thats the sacrifice she has made
3874862 they didnt give me a lot of scores because i threw a lot of body punches
3874863 his head wasnt really open for me to hit my scores should have been a little higher but thank god for the victory this is a big motivator a big boost my confidence level is higher so i expect to do better in my next fight its going to be good really good
3874864 i wanted to get my points boom boom boom and move and i did that but i did not get my points like i wanted
3874865 but i still was an inch ahead it was very hard for him to score against me because i wasnt there for him it was bam bam bam and id move i just stuck with my strategy for the whole fight and came out with a good win
3874866 im just glad he was able to take it out because his opponent was very mature and hes a longtime fighter while john is only 19 years old
3874867 this is his first big international fight like this so i think he did a great job and we are looking forward to his fight on thursday night
3874868 the european boxers box with a lot of force a lot of strength and last night he couldnt get through
3874869 i actually felt they were underscoring us i had the match at at least 9 or 10 2 in our favor but of course they have been underscoring the caribbean countries and the african countries john had to really box tonight or else they would have taken it away from us
3874870 im going to spar with a boxer from the bahamas who has a similar style to the korean and im going to help him out because the guy hes fighting has a style like me so we are helping each other out
3874871 he came in and went into this office and started shooting
3874872 theres not much enemy left in iraq but theres plenty of enemy here to be dealt with
3874873 theres a discussion underway only if the decision is made to replace them what we will insist on is that it be a full up capacity
3874874 we dont want another force in there that isnt fully adaptive for what we think were going to face
3874875 say this draw down in iraq works and marines are made free then weve got to train marines for afghanistan as opposed to going to iraq that takes time that takes four or five months
3874876 great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds
3874877 as far as im concerned reality can go take a flying f at a rolling doughnut
3874878 i am very glad to announce our second quarter financial results during the olympic games period and i am pleased to declare telestones net income continued to grow with an increase of 28 6 in the second quarter which is resulting from the promotion of our new products
3874879 in light of the restructuring currently under way and the promotion plan for telestones new products we believe that our revenues and profits in the year 2008 will continue to improve and eventually eclipse fiscal year 2007s revenue totals with the continued development and application of our new products solutions and the contribution of our newly developing markets

3874917 in europe the view that america is part of what has gone wrong in our world rather than a force to help make it right has become all too common
3874918 in america there are voices that deride and deny the importance of europes role in our security and our future both views miss the truth that europeans today are bearing new burdens and taking more responsibility in critical parts of the world and that just as american bases built in the last century still help to defend the security of this continent so does our country still sacrifice greatly for freedom around the globe

3874936 the decision to migrate is probably influenced by both genetics and environment
3874937 in this study we wanted to determine if changing migratory habits were due to changes in genetic composition in urban populations or were environmental induced
3874938 the personality trait can be an important predictor of how individuals will respond to predictable and unpredictable changes in their environment and how well they cope with these changes
3874939 if we want to understand the ecological and evolutionary importance of variation in personality in natural free living animal populations it would help a lot to know the molecular genetic mechanisms behind the trait

3874974 this new research is tremendously exciting as firstly the biological brain controls its own moving robot body and secondly it will enable us to investigate how the brain learns and memorises its experiences this research will move our understanding forward of how brains work and could have a profound effect on many areas of science and medicine

3875007 solutions can never come from myths they must be based on facts
3875008 the u s governments slavish support of israel brands us as a hypocrite and is responsible for most of the hostility toward the u s americans have been brainwashed into believing that its the arabs and the palestinians in particular who dont want peace that is a big lie israels goal is and always has been to take all of palestine and to get rid of the palestinians
3875009 t heres no group of people in the world who are more clearly victims of ethnic cleansing than the palestinian refugees who have been rotting in refugee camps for 50 years palestinians were ethnically cleansed in 1948 and again in 1967
3875010 the zionists in america are the biggest enemy of freedom of speech and freedom of the press there is

3875071 se a r ssia est violando o cessar fogo e tenho relatos que n o s o muito animadores sobre isso ent o isto servir para aprofundar o isolamento internacional no qual r ssia est se movimentando
3875072 o melhor agora deixar nas m os dos franceses os esfor os de media o

3875082 these three gentlemen will enable us to continue and grow our fundraising efforts in the mac
3875083 its a nice compliment to be chosen first and earn the respect of our big east peers
3875084 however we know there is a lot of work to do for us to end the season atop the standings it is important to stay focused and work hard in our pursuit of ending the season in first place
3875085 sell into the big rallies and buy in the fear

3875091 wi fi helps make the internet more accessible to people
3875092 once you get to the internet then you can go look at your e mail you can go to websites you can pretty much do anything
3875093 certainly on the consumer side theres terrific growth because people have reached the point where they are familiar with wi fi they have it on their laptops and connect when they are travelling
3875094 voice over wi fi is still a cutting edge technology
3875095 people in the future will have more and more devices that are wi fi enabled
3875096 one of the earliest municipalities to embrace it and develop it was fredericton in new brunswick

3875098 it was sold as we will put it in and it will be free

3875103 they have some of the highest teacher salary schedules some of the highest per pupil spending
3875104 its not a matter of lack of school resources its a function of poverty
3875105 it means many of the colleges and universities that may be serving american indians have a lot more work to do
3875106 those students who are not prepared are certainly at greater risk of not completing college if we dont intervene very actively at the outset

3875112 very rarely referred for alcohol treatment and infrequently followed up if referred
3875113 one likely reason is that using these treatment services even when a soldier self refers is not confidential under present military policies accessing alcohol treatment triggers automatic involvement of a soldiers commander and can have negative career ramifications
3875114 the trip to ipoh was nothing but happiness to me
3875115 i went into the post office and i handed them my change of address card
3875116 the guy tells me its going to be at least a couple of weeks before you get your mail and i said why
3875117 that would explain why postage prices are going up because theyre paying for all that extra gas by making all of these unnecessary trips
3875118 it actually goes through another form of processing where the address is looked up and they actually put a sticker on it with the new address
3875119 the mail is then redirected and sent back to tyler to be processed and delivered
3875120 its called pars and thats an automatic redirecting system that we have
3875121 so once our customers change addresses that mail will automatically be forwarded to the new address
3875122 well then that must be your jeep just round the bend nice ride
3875123 in an area with low residential density and high rolling hills it makes all the sense
3875124 if we dont get it right then there could be big consequences
3875125 i think its a mistake to do this without a written roads agreement
3875126 i think its wise to postpone the conditional use permits when we try to do things in the 11th hour like weve done before thats when we get burned to protect the county we have to have the agreement in writing before going ahead
3875127 on my part too once we get this immediate project finalized i think we should immediately begin looking at additional locations for further wind power
3875128 we have an opportunity to take great advantage of our towns natural resources in a way that will simultaneously lower our energy costs and do so in the right non carbon footprint fashion
3875129 the reality is you see it yourself your electric bill isnt going down
3875130 its not much more than whisper at the property line
3875131 the nearby residences to the east of the treatment plant will likely have a largely obscured view of the turbine given the tall trees in the heavily wooded area
3875132 this will also be true for many houses in scituate as most inland lots are wooded or surrounded by wooded terrain
3875133 we had to put an arrow to show where it was
3875134 it ends up for the most part when you look at it you only see a part of the tower and the blades
3875135 our overall goal here is to take this to town meeting ideally at a special town meeting this autumn for approval so we can get cracking right away
3875136 in essence every day we dont take advantage of what we have before us is costing us money
3875137 we want to thank all landowners who have and continue to meet and work with us
3875138 matl wouldnt be too bright to start putting poles in the ground until the appeal is done
3875139 it is increasingly difficult to demonstrate that buying a renewable electricity tariff is offering additional carbon emissions reductions
3875140 businesses signed up to green tariffs based on the evidence available at the time but their choices have been producing only limited additional renewable generation capacity
3875141 many companies bought these tariffs in good faith but there are no guarantees that they actually save carbon they didnt pay much of a premium for the carbon savings they could claim in their marketing statements so they have basically been given a free ride
3875142 theyre worried about being ranked badly nobody wants to come bottom of a table of their peers
3875143 this is a serious problem for a number of companies who have followed the governments guidelines and gone out and purchased green electricity and are now being told that green source is no longer valid
3875144 they say not much fishing goes on at the site itself but thats not true
3875145 and there is also a big worry about the fact they can ban all boats from the site which means the fishermen who work the other side of the site will have to go round which will add to their fuel costs and time
3875146 we have been in close discussions with the developer for many months and its directors are keen to ensure that the north norfolk economy gains maximum benefit from this 830m project
3875147 as well as the offshore work associated with the erection of the turbines a cable will be laid underground from weybourne to salle where the electricity generated by the wind farm will enter the grid
3875148 this consent is a major progression for the project and shows that the government is committed to its target of producing 15pc of its energy from renewables by 2020
3875149 i think thats going to be our biggest area that were going to have to shore up pretty quickly
3875150 i think im going to be spending a lot of time with this group
3875151 with a younger group you may have to give them the problem give them the answer and tell them how to get to it and i think well have to do that with this group not because theyre not intelligent enough to figure it out we just dont have the luxury of waiting for them to figure it out
3875152 one of the things we did due to this year was recruit heavily in the back
3875153 we brought in a number of guys who are going to be competitive i think we have the quality in there to be able to come up with the back four the question is as it is with any other position on the field when you have freshmen there is how good is it going to be right away
3875154 it was two years ago that i saw ray at the olympic development program in a regional in orlando florida which is where all the different regional teams come from across the country the best under 17 kids in the country and ray was clearly the best player down there
3875155 he played in the back they played him at midfield they played him everywhere he was just so competitive and refused to lose with that type of mindset that kind of thing is contagious across your team
3875156 hes a humble kid who really doesnt care about accolades he just wants to win thats a fantastic quality to have in a young man
3875157 konas another one whos athletic and fast and i think hes going to be another project
3875158 hes another one of these kids whos way undervalued but is going to be competitive
3875159 cada vez te veo menos adonde vas donde te metes creo que te escondes siempre espero que tu vida espere un sitio mejor que este las cosas de antes ya no suceden y no quiero presionarte y no quiero obligarte la gente aqu no es como antes vienen van y desaparecen hecho de menos a los de siempre s lo quiero que tu tengas suerte t ya sabes te lo mereces un beso muy fuerte y hasta siempre
3875160 shes going to come out here for the kids birthdays
3875161 it will be the first time the cousins meet im sure the boys will be like big brothers to maddie
3875162 really really good i went through a stage when i was in high school when it wasnt so good but now im at a stage where i really appreciate her a lot more
3875163 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby
3875164 its not just music for the united states its world music
3875165 im touching so many different kinds of people on this album as well as keeping my core fan base at the same time
3875166 its totally given me a new energy a new everything
3875167 when you have a lot of stress and negativity around you when you cut that away you cleanse im starting over basically
3875168 i want people to say its breath of fresh air from everything thats out there
3875169 its still going to be me and what they know me for but its still going to be newer
3875170 with my fan base being broader and larger now im looking to somewhere where somebody can really take advantage of that and take it to the next level
3875171 best present for the president for the people for the country and for myself
3875172 is just one more way that china now exploiting the business dimension of the games is supporting the legitimacy of a nation whose leaders are genocidal and whose president has just been indicted by the icc international criminal court for genocide war crimes and crimes against humanity
3875173 these sports are also highly watched events among the chinese population and we felt it was a great opportunity to have an entire countrys athletes wear our products to compete and hence raise the awareness of our brand among our consumers located mainly in the second and third tier cities
3875174 a new race to the bottom using the pretext of competition to engage in what is morally wrong
3875175 be careful when you fight the monsters lest you become one
3875176 talking much about oneself can also be a means to conceal oneself
3875177 what else is love but understanding and rejoicing in the fact that another person lives acts and experiences otherwise than we do
3875178 when you stare into the abyss the abyss stares back at you
3875179 you need chaos in your soul to give birth to a dancing star
3875180 what is done out of love always takes place beyond good and evil
3875181 for believe me the secret for harvesting from existence the greatest fruitfulness and greatest enjoyment is to live dangerously
3875182 a thinker sees his own actions as experiments and questions as attempts to find out something
3875183 out of lifes school of war what does not destroy me makes me stronger
3875184 im gonna be extra nice to her for a few days cause she might go roid rage on me
3875185 hier heb je iets meer de illusie van vrijheid iets meer dan buiten honderd man samen moet je het rooien en iedereen heeft hetzelfde stemrecht dus iedereen is gelijk
3875186 dan doe je dat maar hier kan iedereen zijn eigen ding doen voor kinderen is het geweldig voor ouderen trouwens ook
3875187 het is maar net op welk moment je in het leven hier binnenstapt
3875188 het was spektakel maar ook vooral theater theater zonder agressie want je wist toch wel hoe het afliep
3875189 onder de brug met de bocht mee naar rechts en dan de tweede links daar wonen de chte bedreigden
3875190 als je hier de radio aanzet hoor je constant het gelul van piloten
3875191 je hebt hier ruimte en vrijheid geen parkeervergunningen geen wachtlijsten geen gemeentebelastingen geen reclamefolders en niemand die je op de vingers tikt als je de vuilnis te vroeg buiten zet
3875192 je bent ltijd met je huis bezig en moet je alles zelf doen zelf gasflessen halen en zorgen dat je genoeg hout hebt voor de winter toen ik hier kwam wonen gierde de wind door het huis
3875193 we hebben weinig contact met de gemeente en dat willen we natuurlijk graag zo houden
3875194 je hebt gelijk op dit moment is het misschien wel de saaiste plek op aarde
3875195 lactrol has been in the ethanol industry globally for 30 years
3875196 we believe there can be harmony and we have three businesses that address the needs of the ethanol industry and the animal health and nutrition industry
3875197 we see the whole picture the value of not just the ethanol but the co products that come out of there and end up in the animal feed and nutrition business
3875198 now they need to get to know the people and the company behind it and we think tom will help us accomplish that
3875199 all the mawassi people used to work in the settlements and make good money now there is nothing to do even our own agricultural land is barren
3875200 i have no fuel now for my car where can i go freedom is a slogan even for a donkey you need money which i dont have
3875201 we are all now unemployed and depend on charity for food
3875202 my sons were farmers in the greenhouses we worked in the settlements and had resources now i dont think i could survive without the un before was better
3875203 working is not everything the checkpoints made our city a prison we cant say the occupation days were better than today
3875204 neither hamas nor fatah knocked on the doors to ask what we need people are fed up we have become beggars
3875205 at 9 a m in every other country everyone is at his desk doing his work
3875206 here people are by the side of the road with their arms crossed together
3875207 well there was no showoffy jumping around the stage like some bands
3875208 the least expensive way to own a cell phone in america
3875209 you break your stick on the back of the players neck you cross check him in the back of the head and he ends up with his face in the glass enclosure or in the ice
3875210 schiet nou maar op homo ik sta hier niet om wortel te schieten en als je deel bent van die nepautomaat blijf er dan inzitten
3875211 do such things what they are yet he knows not but they shall be the terrors of the earth
3875212 after recently hearing of the burden the military reimbursement process put on soliders traveling to war zones the choice for us to forego payment for a third check bag from the department of defense was clear
3875213 plus they fought against the government over censorship love or hate what the deregulation of what can be said on recorded music has led to that event deserves to be honored

3875216 has nothing to do with the kind of islam that is violent aggressive and so on
3875217 weve signed my new contract today wednesday lampard told chelsea tv
3875218 im personally very happy and i hope ive made the chelsea fans happy ive had seven great seasons here and now i can have many more
3875219 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of the frustrating things a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
3875220 my world got turned upside down and i dont think it is anything anyone appreciates until you go through it lampard said
3875221 the club gave me time and i appreciate that i feel for sure ive made 100 percent the right decision for myself for my family and for chelsea football club
3875222 these are big issues for the club for frank and any other player kenyon said
3875223 whatever has gone on i think there is that underlying desire that we get there its taken both frank and the club longer than we originally thought
3875224 it is continuing hopefully not for as long as the speculation about frank he said
3875225 theyre back and theyre willing to stand up for their interests and the west doesnt have a lot of options
3875226 if you give the russians a chance they will take advantage of it they will play their own game and by their own rules
3875227 its hard to see how russia will pull out of south ossetia and abkhazia now georgia now will have a big hole in it
3875228 probably believed rather naively he might get more support from the united states
3875229 you could probably say georgia triggered it but russia was clearly ready to respond
3875230 the straw that broke the camels back was saakashvili and georgia moving into south ossetia
3875231 the west does not have a whole lot of leverage over russia right now
3875232 very much shows that russia calls the shots in the region
3875233 theres going to be a serious debate in the west now about how we deal with russia
3875234 it is not business as usual anymore with the russians and there are consequences for doing what they are doing
3875235 russia has one foot integrated into the international economy and community of states and one foot that is not quite in it
3875236 whether they havent achieved some tactical objectives at the expense of some strategic objectives
3875237 i wanted to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and people and are reviewing options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia
3875238 but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop
3875239 we are not happy with the way the united states has been behaving especially the way the united states has been propping up mr saakashvili over the past few years
3875240 i hope we continue normal relations with the united states and the rest of the international community
3875241 we have equal interests between the russian federation and the united states we should look and try to resolve this international crisis
3875242 the conduct then was in the defendants scope of employment regardless of whether it was unlawful or contrary to the national security of the united states
3875243 were considering all of our options including appeal which i think is likely
3875244 we assess that intent to attack the u s homeland remains undiminished
3875245 now has many of the operational and organizational advantages it once enjoyed across the border in afghanistan
3875246 they were retreating it wasnt panic but they were trying to leave one by one not in groups
3875247 we dont have anything we dont have food we left when the shelling started with very few things
3875248 we dont know whats going on and why the russians did this to us they said they were defending ossetians who are they defending here
3875249 if the russians say theyre defending the civilian population why dont they care about kodori gorge
3875250 they dont know where theyll go we have no idea theres so much confusion
3875251 georgias ill wishers are well aware that georgia is impossible to defeat when it is united and when it has world support
3875252 wanneer je een magnetisch deeltje aan de biomarkers hecht zijn deze moleculen relatief snel en eenvoudig te verplaatsen naar het sensoroppervlak

3875254 por qu google maps no muestra ninguna ciudad o carretera en georgia o en sus vecinos armenia y azerbaiy n nunca lanzamos cobertura de estos pa ses porque no est bamos satisfechos con los datos disponibles

3875256 we know you and we do not like what you are doing
3875257 we expect to make a recommendation to the town council in early september if a viable solution presents itself and all goes well the town of barrington could begin to reap the benefits of enough renewable energy to power its high school by 2010
3875258 but warren buffett and midamerican energy are making most of the money
3875259 were getting more and more economies of scale with the bigger turbines and larger wind farms
3875260 if youre a farmer and used to a quiet environment a wind turbine changes everything
3875261 its dirty tiles will break were not going to promise a lot of new jobs most of the jobs are very technical and require specialized skills that most communities dont have
3875262 frankly the local person who gains the most economically from the wind farm is probably the guy who owns the local rock quarry
3875263 we dont know where this is all going to be in the next three years or more
3875264 we really dont know where technology is going to be
3875265 i am informed that the contractor has refused to sign the contract in this case and the project is now defunct
3875266 mr pitney has not responded to an e mail sent last week he has not said he will not sign it
3875267 needs to discuss in executive session whether to discuss it with mr pitney or consider it dead
3875268 prominent political economic and infrastructure targets designed to produce mass casualties visually dramatic destruction and significant economic and political aftershocks
3875269 has replenished its bench of skilled mid level lieutenants capable of directing its global operations
3875270 i heard the shots and then the alarm went off in the judges house
3875271 its such a quiet neighborhood thank god my neighbors werent home at the time
3875272 me and my husband were awakened by the gunshots it was four shots and the judges alarm went off everybody in the neighborhood was up
3875273 while weve been favoring a dollar rebound in our view this has come a little bit too far too fast there are still significant headwinds for the u s economy and therefore some headwinds for the dollar
3875274 theres been a sell off in the yen crosses it has weighed on the euro and its certainly weighed on sterling
3875275 in may 2007 she invested in t boone pickens clean energy fuels corp clne which is the sole sponsor of a proposal in california to funnel 5 billion in state funds and 5 billion in federal funs to this corporation which will indirectly help them create a giant wind farm in the texas panhandle
3875276 there was a creditor meeting and council was concerned that the properties may be broken up
3875277 who gave you the right the permission the clearance the verification and insinuation that you are free who did this who taught you to read it was against the law and you are too obtuse to understand the meaning of these words yet you insist on speaking them yet you insist on looking me in the eye and demanding that i address you by your name who do you think you are and who let you in here i said who let you in here where the sign said niggers and women need not apply
3875278 aim to offer more hand holding for sellers and charge lower fees than the behemoth ebay
3875279 the july numbers were essentially in line with estimates so the initial reaction to them was understandably muted the report overall though is on the soft side
3875280 the georgian leadership is a special project for the united states
3875281 at some time it will be necessary to choose between the prestige of this relatively virtual project and partnership on questions that require collective action
3875282 all of these years georgia has been armed notably by the united states
3875283 russia has warned many times that our american partners and other countries are playing a dangerous game that the potential built with the help of the united states and other countries could be used in dangerous adventures
3875284 the georgian leadership is a special project for the united states
3875285 at some time it will be necessary to choose between the prestige of this relatively virtual project and partnership on questions that require collective action
3875286 if we want to put our economy on the right track and fight terrorism then we need political stability unless we bring political stability i think we cant fight them properly
3875287 we have something like this come up and were always putting roadblocks in the way
3875288 its very difficult to grow when we put up these roadblocks the drainage problem should be the landowners responsibility
3875289 you may lose money now but gain it back many times over
3875290 my personal view is that this isnt a random attack
3875291 there is a reason for these two people to come to this address there is a motive behind it and over the next few days we will find out firstly the motive and the identity
3875292 we just asked the neighbours people in the general area to search their sections and if they find any weapons handguns or hammers to notify police straight away
3875293 we will be talking to parents friends and family to get a clearer picture of what this 14 year old boy was really like
3875294 they would have told someone what has happened and we really need those people to come forward
3875295 national simply thinks that spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on advertising agencies to develop a new brand and then to spend millions to change all the signs in the department is not the way in which we are going to protect that which is special and unique to new zealand
3875296 but im not going to give you a figure because were out to tender
3875297 we dont think that message has got out and all were doing here is making sure that we get it out
3875298 two companies have put forward bids for the 17 skyhawks and 17 aermacchi trainer aircraft with both bids valuing the aircraft at us110 nz162 million
3875299 if one or other of the companies is successful in securing a contract for training from the us defence department a contract could be signed with a successful bidder within the next few months
3875300 water is seeping in and pooling under the white latex coating that was supposed to protect these aircraft from the elements and preserve them in a saleable condition
3875301 the current market value of the skyhawks will be dropping daily especially given the further damage that will have inevitably occurred in the recent bad weather experienced by the marlborough region
3875302 im afraid the team gold medal is already decided we wanted to beat the germans but today we see that this is going to be a very tough job its over we will be lucky to get a medal at all now i am afraid
3875303 if one horse from any team makes a big mistake then it is going to be wide open
3875304 the trot was good and the passage was very good but i made a mistake in the canter when i did seven strides instead of six
3875305 before i went in she was a little tense but in the ring she was totally fine she did not seem to be aware of either the video screen or the cameras
3875306 the test was definitely not my best the horse didnt make any glaring mistakes but he made some minor ones
3875307 the other riders will have to get their best score ever to pull me out of the mud
3875308 he has had some down days since he got here but today i couldnt have asked for more
3875309 i have ridden in two world cup finals and you hear names like kyra and anky and you wonder what you are doing here but now i am at the olympic games with them and im hoping i can perform well
3875310 but i think my horse was not enjoying the heat because she was not as strong as normal she was coming back behind the bit and then she got her tongue over but i could still ride her through the canter half pass then her tongue came right again but it cost me too many points i had no big mistakes except when she had the tongue over the bit the pirouettes felt really good although she could maybe have been stronger in passage
3875311 this has been a wonderful month getting to know the people on the british team and the olympic experience has been very special
3875312 when i am riding on a team i always like to do a
3875313 i was in athens with another horse but it was an absolute disaster for me
3875314 i ride the best test i can ride on any single day and today this was the best i could have done
3875315 then the fei world equestrian games in kentucky and its all about building up a good team for the london olympics in 2012
3875316 and that really helped him to produce good flying changes
3875317 im used to it they often send me in first because they know i have strong nerves
3875318 thats why we are here we are here to go for it
3875319 if bonnie takes a deep breath after the halt and then lets it out again i know it is going to be good i just have to wait for him to breathe out and then we go
3875320 he could have gone with more pressure in the half pass but he had a super relaxed walk
3875321 even before the olympics but i can tell you that since the start of the games the numbers of customers coming here is simply amazing
3875322 the foreigners mostly buy portable electronic items like cameras camera lenses memory sticks mp3 players and mobile phones
3875323 giving them room for negotiation over some of the items makes them happy that way they are likely to come again the following day and even bring a few friends along
3875324 say goodbye to the myth that oil demand and gas demand will soar regardless of the price the evidence is more than clear that oil demand is on the wane demand destruction is the word of the day as the evidence of that destruction permeates all around us
3875325 demand destruction is a pretty significant fact in the us and oecd
3875326 so i think it looks as though you are starting to see the impact of higher prices
3875327 in the 1950s jobs were offered in canteens and offices we have a goal of hiring 3 000 teachers over the next three years we have decided to reach out to 50 000 engineers researchers all over the world even if 500 come it would be fine
3875328 fueron much simos los que me escribieron pidi ndome rezar por ellos me manifestaban sus alegr as sus preocupaciones sus proyectos de vida as como sus problemas familiares y de trabajo sus esperanzas que portan en el coraz n junto a las angustias relacionadas con las incertidumbres que la humanidad vive en este momento
3875329 puedo asegurar que para todos y cada uno tengo un recuerdo especialmente en la cotidiana celebraci n de la santa s bien que el primer servicio que puedo dar a la iglesia y la humanidad es el de la oraci n porque rezando pongo en las manos del se or con confianza el ministerio que l mismo me ha confiado junto a la suerte de toda la comunidad eclesial y civil
3875330 aparentemente sus existencias podr an ser consideradas como una derrota pero es justamente
3875331 la oraci n fue el secreto de esta santa co patrona de europa

3875336 isp is truly excited to establish this new relationship with the university of arkansas one of the great athletic programs in the country
3875337 we also are excited about being able to work with katv and building on the 40 year tradition katv has established in bringing the passion of razorback athletics to the state of arkansas
3875338 we are pleased that through our new agreement with isp katv will remain at the forefront of razorback coverage for many years to come
3875339 we have enjoyed our four decade partnership with the university of arkansas and are looking forward to maintaining that relationship moving forward via our partnership with isp as the continuing
3875340 from the beginning of our discussions with katv and isp i was excited about what the partnership would mean for razorback athletics
3875341 i have worked with a number of other multi media rightsholders but in my opinion isp is the best and is clearly the leader in college sports
3875342 our agreement with isp not only helps protect us from uncertain financial times but also guarantees revenue at a significantly higher level than what we have generated in the past
3875343 as our budget continues to reflect the increasing costs associated with operating a 19 sport program the increased revenue generated from this partnership will help us secure the essential funding to support our more than 450 student athletes and provide them the resources to succeed in the southeastern conference and nationally

3875351 i can tell you that what we are doing at the moment is sending a signal that the u n is back the u n is back to stay
3875352 we have to be able to move a lot of the investment to the private sector
3875353 our biggest way of improving security is to make sure that young people are employed
3875354 the iraqi people are not ready to take over for themselves
3875355 iraqis do not yet know how to run a government and it is going to take some time to make this government function
3875356 it brings the whole u n organization together in partnership with iraq and its people to reduce poverty foster growth and consolidate democracy in our country
3875357 the two presidents decided to establish diplomatic relations at the level of ambassadors in line with the treaty of the united nations and international law
3875358 instructed their foreign ministries to take the necessary measures in this regard to conform with the laws of the two countries
3875359 assad has instructed all concerned syrian officials that he wants this visit to be successful and fruitful
3875360 the visit is a starting point for future relations we hope it will yield good relations in the interests
3875361 in the face of all those who are manipulating its security and stability
3875362 syria wants a stable united and arab lebanon which does not serve as a trampoline for hostile activities
3875363 april is the cruellest month breeding lilacs out of the dead land mixing memory and desire stirring dull roots with spring rain winter kept us warm covering earth in forgetful snow feeding a little life with dried tubers

3875392 good but seriously youre traveling in the past there are certain rules were dealing with a well known event a fixed point in history there were no witnesses to the crash and when youre dealing with an event like this you cant trust people to keep quiet twenty or forty years down the line
3875393 not a problem i just want one night of 1940s fun
3875394 im glad to hear it ive found you some spending money
3875395 certainly theyre not as valuable elsewhere in the universe you know ive been to one world where the pressure was so high that diamonds were everywhere but you could live like king on a lump of coal all those diamonds no fossil fuel
3875396 well leave the gold dust though might be a little hard to explain to a jewelers why do you even have gold dust in the first place
3875397 its not as if the video will change history for starters no one will
3875398 look i dont have the exact time all i know is
3875399 that beam it was disruptor technology but thats impossible you dont invent them for centuries
3875400 maybe it was alien of origin groups have been reverse engineering alien technology for years im sure of it
3875401 no i know my tech disruptor technology was very human in design you lot are good with weapons but theres no way a 1940s installation should have one it would be like horatio nelson attacking the french with a cruise missile and trust me he didnt
3875402 haze would you like to accompany me in breaking into a top secret military installation
3875403 new york has a proud tradition of having one of the strongest reporters shield laws in the country i was shocked to discover that in 2008 our law does not provide protections to journalist bloggers one of the fastest growing mediums for obtaining news this glaring omission must not be allowed to continue
3875404 this is just one example of journalist bloggers threatened with civil and criminal penalties based solely on the content of their blog if we do not enact my legislation i can guarantee that we will witness more cases of journalist bloggers facing contempt charges and jail time this will have a chilling effect on free speech and a bloggers ability to aggressively report the news it is time new yorks shield law reflected the reality of 2008

3875439 im proud that i am georgian and they hate us because we are georgian
3875440 abba give me a word that i may be saved
3875441 you know how you insulted them and they did not reply and how you praised them and they did not speak so you too if you wish to be saved must do the same and become a dead man like the dead take no account of either the scorn of men or their praises and you can be saved
3875442 among other things youll find that youre not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior youre by no means alone on that score youll be excited and stimulated to know many many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritally as you are right now happily some of them kept records of their troubles youll learn from them if you want to just as someday if you have something to offer someone will learn something from you its a beautiful reciprocal arrangement and it isnt education its history its poetry

3875453 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
3875454 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class
3875455 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
3875456 t he option should exist to invest in the benchmark as an alternative to the portfolio under consideration

3875458 if theres one truism in economics i believe its that recessions always kill inflation every time without a doubt theres no way around it even in stagflation once youre stuck in a recession your prices are going to plunge
3875459 so which is the better measure of inflationary expectations the spread between tips and treasuries or a spread between tips and a risk adjusted rate for all long bonds

3875463 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
3875464 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
3875465 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

3875475 we have the physical system were taking flow measurements of actual swimmers and were getting more information than anyone has ever had before about swimming and how the swimmer interacts with the water and so far these techniques have contributed to some very significant improvements in the lap times of olympic swimmers
3875476 this project moved the swimming world beyond the observational into scientific fact
3875477 the knowledge gained gave me the foundation for which every technical stroke change in preparation for the beijing olympics was based
3875478 to see how a swimmers motion affects the flow you need to know how much force the swimmer is producing and how that force impacts the water
3875479 swimming research has strived to understand water flow around a swimmer for decades because how a swimmers body moves the surrounding water is everything
3875480 the ability to measure flow and forces in a natural and unimpeded environment hasnt been available until recently and dr weis technology and methods presented usa swimming with a unique opportunity that united states swimmers and coaches could learn a lot from
3875481 how often does a researcher get to do something like this

3875640 they are playing to the gallery while we are trying to create a harmonious community of farmers
3875641 the cfu and its british sponsors should not believe their own propaganda that they can defy the government

3875692 reminded of his mandate and that it was time to see the coachs initial thinking being realised on the field
3875693 it was ricky who helped make history in the house of pain
3875694 personally i think ricky has proved himself as south africas leading scrum half is it fouries world cup status that now elevates him above ricky
3875695 in my view fourie has done nothing to justify a place in the starting line up
3875696 conrad jantjes is on present form the number one full back it is worrying that people make decisions with their heart to give someone his 100th test cap
3875697 i know peter wants to win the tri nations but he must realise he will be measured according to his ability to transform the team and to make it representative of the countrys population for the 2011 world cup
3875698 we have also seen nothing of the new type of rugby that peter has spoken of it is interesting that people of mixed race and blacks traditionally support the all blacks when they play at newlands

3875702 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
3875703 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
3875704 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
3875705 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
3875706 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
3875707 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
3875708 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
3875709 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
3875710 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
3875711 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
3875712 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
3875713 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
3875714 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
3875715 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
3875716 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
3875717 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
3875718 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
3875719 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
3875720 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
3875721 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
3875722 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
3875723 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
3875724 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
3875725 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
3875726 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
3875727 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
3875728 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
3875729 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
3875730 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
3875731 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
3875732 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
3875733 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
3875734 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
3875735 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
3875736 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that
3875737 thats baloney man thats whats wrong with america now every time somebody screws up we tell them its all right you dont pay your bills you can file bankruptcy you kill somebody spend 10 years in jail and well let you out thats whats wrong with society now man if you do the crime do the time if you had the guts to do it have the guts to take your punishment
3875738 a bullish bias is warranted against 158 60 but with 5 waves up from there the eurjpy is susceptible to a correction back to at least 165 31
3875739 hopefully by the time we get to september well be able to pick up again where we left off on just solar power
3875740 as far as we can tell these are the best conditions weve seen on earth
3875741 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama
3875742 i think evans real strength is you get someone on the ticket who has a record of being strong on national security and that is a very important quality to have
3875743 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3875744 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3875745 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3875746 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3875747 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3875748 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3875749 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3875750 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3875751 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3875752 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3875753 its a process the law says they have to go through if they intend to raise taxes
3875754 it says they can raise taxes but they dont have to do it
3875755 were just using surrounding counties tax rates as a comparison and were less than the average of those counties
3875756 as soon as we have those the public will have them
3875757 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3875758 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3875759 they did pay attention they listened learned read and re evaluated their opinion
3875760 it does make you have faith in the justice system
3875761 this is a victory for californias students parents and education community
3875762 i hope the ruling settles this matter for parents and home schooled children once and for all in california but assure them that we as elected officials will continue to defend parents rights
3875763 california impliedly allows parents to home school as a private school but has provided no enforcement mechanism given the states compelling interest in educating all of its children and the absence of an express statutory and regulatory framework for home schooling in california additional clarity in this area of the law would be helpful
3875764 we want parents to have the freedom to home school but we dont want children to become captives in a home school that doesnt prepare them for work or civic engagement as a functioning adult
3875765 son of man with one blow i am about to take away from you the delight of your eyes

3875767 delight ourselves in the lord and he will give us the desires of our hearts
3875768 if they wanted to book a four hour window we could certainly go later in the evening
3875769 if the theatre manager has the staffing they could go till two in the morning
3875770 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3875771 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3875772 what we find is modest sun exposure gives enormous vitamin d benefits
3875773 the current data provide a further indication of the beneficial role of sun induced vitamin d for cancer prognosis
3875774 its a dynamic time for our organization and our art form
3875775 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems
3875776 but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odor perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3875777 when women are pregnant theres no selection pressure evolutionarily speaking for having a preference for genetically dissimilar odors
3875778 and if there is any pressure at all it would be towards relatives who would be more genetically similar because the relatives would help those individuals rear the baby

3875960 we cant be overcritical of american publishers for cowering under terrorist threats after all the guardian like every other british newspaper lacked the gumption to publish the danish cartoons but all who care about free speech have a duty to make this sort of censorship counterproductive random house should pay this author substantial compensation and the book should be placed on a website so everyone can read it

3875967 my portrayal of muhammad is extremely respectful and of the origins of islam is very accurate and respectful
3875968 muhammad says in the koran that he was a mortal i assume he did all the things a man does he had 12 wives im sure he had sex with them
3875969 im glad the story has come out because now any publisher who takes it on will do so with eyes wide open im hoping to find someone who is as passionate as i am and my agent is
3875970 they behaved as any publisher in the west should do and upheld freedom of publication and freedom of speech they stuck by their guns at not inconsiderable risk to their senior executives these are the principles we should live and die by

3875981 moving to a regional support model benefits each of the nine companies by creating a larger support system that would previously have been unattainable on its own
3875982 nrt has successfully deployed a regional support model in its coldwell banker operations in northern california new england and the mid atlantic as well as other parts of the company as we monitored the market we recognized that we had an opportunity to capitalize on the close geographic proximity of these nine nrt companies as well as an already established culture of sharing best practices by adopting this model now by strengthening the back office support of these individual companies we are greater than the sum of our parts and ultimately better positioned to service our sales associates and their clients

3875986 new jersey also requires lenders and brokers to register their loan officers and solicitors however the solicitors did not have to pass a test
3875987 mortgage referral agents think twice about having consumers accept or buy into predatory loans
3875988 even before the crisis occurred but harrisburg failed to act
3875989 there were some bad mortgage brokers just as there are some bad people in every industry
3875990 becoming a mortgage originator was too easy pay the fee fill out the paperwork and you could start originating loans
3875991 the law is a welcome change that will weed out many of the bad originators
3875992 i think it is about time that licensing has been addressed
3875993 every loan officer should need to comply with certain standards to conduct business
3875994 with the changes in the law the brokers association is changing membership levels
3875995 there will now be brokers and originators with originators paying a reduced fee but have the same services from the association as the broker
3875996 put your pride aside and get help a lot of people are not taking steps needed to avert foreclosure until it is too late its more difficult to overturn a foreclosure than avert one

3876000 you can listen to the original tape in many places and hear exactly what i said
3876001 the media edited and distorted it to hassle me i have no intention of apologizing i already apologized last year
3876002 this is a war waged by the israelists against the jewish people in order to eradicate and desecrate it and the result is the expulsion of the jewish people from the promised land like the torah says
3876003 there are israelists who have taken over what is called the state
3876004 every day they propagate blood libels against settlers courts are ephemeral whereas the torah is everlasting
3876005 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
3876006 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3876007 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3876008 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3876009 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
3876010 that they all may be one even as thou father are in me and i in thee
3876011 in those days there was no king in israel every man did what was right in his own eyes
3876012 what was not possible twenty years ago may be possible today
3876013 its not how many times you get knocked down but its how many times you get back up and go forward

3876018 the show would follow harry caul played on film by gene hackman on surveillance assignments that are self contained meaning one per show but also with a longer plot arc tying them together about the people who are following caul because hes hearing things he shouldnt be hearing
3876019 phenomenon known as singing or musical sand has been found in about 30 sets of dunes in the world and each has its own accent
3876020 if the common run of contemporary art risks triviality in the pursuit of seduction the new kind incurs hysteria as a toll of earnest intensity emotional reach exceeds formal grasp throughout the show and certain melodramatic lurches fail entirely i dont care what robert kusmirowski intends by his painstaking reconstruction of the una bomber ted kaczynskis cabin its dumb existentialist standards of authenticity may be back in force however fleetingly how much can we bear of art that like sebalds writing glories in bottomless malaise i expect well find out
3876021 the horse with its head in the wall maurizio cattelan untitled 2007 was the most arresting work on display i imagined that the horse wasnt dead as much as escaping the pretentious curatorial premise
3876022 retelling of a midsummer nights dream set in buena vista park in san francisco
3876023 for too long wielded a dogmatic veto over any discussion of limiting abortions
3876024 not because of your position on abortion but despite it
3876025 wars of choice capital punishment hunger homelessness health care and refugees
3876026 because they think you not only defend partial birth abortion but also are against lifesaving therapy for newborns surviving an abortion attempt
3876027 can you just simply affirm your conviction that any newborn even after an abortion attempt should be given effective life sustaining treatment
3876028 you may find that the position of most american men and women is quite different from narals
3876029 with your commitment to reasoned evidence based and respectful discourse are you able to challenge your party to welcome pro life catholics into its supposed big tent
3876030 i think since 2004 weve really been talking to the democratic leadership about the importance of trying to expand the big tent of the democratic party
3876031 there will be a place for pro life democrats at the democratic convention as well
3876032 i cant see him getting up there and not talking about being pro life it just wouldnt make much sense for him to speak
3876033 casey symbolizes the pro life cause his name is associated with the issue that would be the whole point of having him speak
3876034 we need to provide more support and options for women to carry to term instead of treating abortion as only option
3876035 our role is very specific we are here to help systematically eliminate the reasons that drive women to abortion well talk to anybody who has been elected to this office to further this goal
3876036 not to have war between naral and national right to life but to listen to stories of women who felt they had no choice but abortion to hear stories of parents who struggle in the workplace and at home and at school trying to make it for themselves and their kids to listen to birth mothers of adopted children
3876037 women dont want another 35 years of this abortion is a reflection that we have not met the needs of women women have settled for less
3876038 twenty five years have passed since the promulgation of the code of canon law of 1983 and there is still much to be done in applying it knowing canon law well and faithfully applying it is essential for the church to be a mirror of justice speculum iustitiae as paul vi said
3876039 it is undeniable that we living in a new phase in the church as the beloved john paul ii said
3876040 the answer canon law gives to these new challenges is a necessary complement on the one hand it does not limit charisms but makes them more beautiful conferring upon them stability and continuity which are necessary on the other hand the legal canonical perspective allows for the rights of persons who participate in these associative realities as well as of the communities themselves to be protected
3876041 have the courage to limit themselves and the clarity to set their priorities
3876042 the time a priest spends with the lord and therefore having time for prayer
3876043 to learn what is truly essential to learn where my presence is truly needed as a priest and where i cannot delegate to anybody and at the same time i should humbly accept that there are many things and moments that require my presence but that cannot be done because i recognise my own limitations i think that such humility will be understood by people
3876044 and with this there is something else i should understand how to delegate and call others to collaborate
3876045 a true community of brothers who should sustain and help one another
3876046 isolation in loneliness and sadness and therefore it is important we get together regularly
3876047 no priest is a priest all by himself we are a presbyterate and only in this communion with the bishop can each one carry out his service
3876048 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3876049 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3876050 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3876051 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3876052 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3876053 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3876054 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3876055 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3876056 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3876057 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3876058 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3876059 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3876060 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3876061 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3876062 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3876063 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3876064 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3876065 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3876066 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3876067 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3876068 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3876069 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3876070 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

3876081 i felt id lived before as some kind of royalty
3876082 i first heard african drum rhythms and chants at the movies
3876083 then when i had the opportunity to go to africa and visit the villages i heard the real raw true rhythms and realised the origins of the old negro spirituals i grew up with in the south
3876084 guys in slavery sang praises to the lord to deliver them from bondage that was one of the few things we were allowed to do praise pray worship and sing spirituals and theyd let us sing the blues as well
3876085 blues evolved into gospel a cry for deliverance or the hereafter and the relief and celebration of passing over from this life to another
3876086 wed sit on the porch at night and sing those negro spirituals
3876087 when i recorded black moses in 1971 my marriage was breaking up and i was broken hearted
3876088 most of the titles were about relationships ending it was sad i used to stand in front of the mic and cry i had to have my secretary hold my hand while i was singing tunes like help me love which portishead sampled on their dummy album the record company named it black moses because of the influence id gained but the subject matter reflected a man mourning a relationship that had hit the rocks
3876089 i thought it a bit sacrilegious but when i realised the relevance it had to black people i wore it with pride
3876090 we had just come through the civil rights struggle with dr king and black people needed unity a bald headed black guy wearing the chains that once represented bondage and slavery now made them represent power it meant something
3876091 theres one more thing i want to tell you when i was black moses wearing those chains across my bare chest and when i had the chrome on my cadillac thats now in the stax museum of american soul music dipped in gold like a chariot i never thought of the parallels with pharaohs in ancient egypt then in 1992 i was crowned a king in ghana the home of my ancestors it was like history repeating itself because id always felt id lived before as some kind of royalty i feel i have a responsibility i influence people hopefully on the positive side thats why i started the isaac hayes foundation to teach literacy and music in american schools and built a school in ghana
3876092 at all times st john has the best interests of patients communities and staff in mind
3876093 immediate clinical care was provided by the ambulance officers to the injured pedestrian at the scene before he was transported to hospital by another ambulance
3876094 the ambulance crew involved have been stood down for now and usual support services are being provided

3876101 its an emotional moment because swimming has been my life
3876102 the phone was a disappointment from the standpoint that it couldnt maintain a consistent connection with the 3g network all the other features were fantastic
3876103 frankly if i knew it was going to be like this i wouldnt have paid the extra 10 a month
3876104 what were seeing is that the iphone 3g is performing very well
3876105 im not denying that people are having problems but we have to deal with these on a case by case basis
3876106 my belief is that because at amp ts network is not built out to every cell site people are getting frustrated because theyre finding places where the 3g signal isnt available or is weak
3876107 that doesnt mean you cant get a good experience on 1900mhz
3876108 typically the more you pack into a phone the tougher it is to build a really good one

3876110 sometimes customers may want to pin a problem on the device
3876111 or they want to pin it on the operator but really it doesnt matter how well they work separately they need to work together
3876112 i think the biggest disappointment was the service of both at amp t and apple i expected a lot more from both organizations
3876113 they should admit that there is an issue and that they are working through it
3876114 since the programs inception nasa has been working an aggressive plan to achieve flight capability before our march 2015 target

3876132 thank you so much for the awesomely complete coverage you are providing on all of the equestrian activities at the 2008 olympic games we horse people are fanatics just like many other sports followers and have felt a little left out in years past but we understand that most americans dont care about equestrian and that it air time is precious and that it doesnt make good business sense to spend much air time on a mostly unknown or little understood sport

3876149 seattles gang problem is small compared to other cities but it definitely holds its own
3876150 its a bunch of teenagers i would call them delinquents that have adopted a gang name or identity and that identity automatically falls into a structure of rivalries that those members must participate in to these young people their identity as a sure o or a crip or a blood is as serious as someone elses identity conflict over religion like the shiites and the sunnis thats an identity conflict the irony is theyre all the same theyre all muslims youre all young people from seattle

3876153 the republican base was ready for somebody to stand up and say to the democrats were not going to take it anymore
3876154 jim marshall and john barrow can go back to their districts and talk about how conservative they are but their first vote in the new 111th congress will be to turn the keys of the country back to someone from that liberal san francisco mentality

3876158 unified synthesis product global climate change in the united states
3876159 scientists and researchers in climate and related fields economists policymakers and busin the polar bears are all right
3876160 take the famous ice core data this was the jewel in the crown of global warming theory al gore said it proved a link between carbon dioxide and temperature he failed to mention that in the data the connection was clearly the wrong way round temperature driving co2 levels not the other way round
3876161 but if you take all the chemistry thermal dymanics and theiries about carbon etc and take them down to basic priciples and back them up by the last hundred years of research and scientific findings then you update them with the mass of evidence from all of the recent studies if you do all this and you link to the studies the scientists and all of this is backed by facts the global warming hoax people
3876162 i dont see how dying polarbears has to do with politics or even america

3876185 theres a fair amount of risk and harm that results from testing mistakes and slips
3876186 one of the most striking and disturbing findings was that minority patients were nearly three times more likely to experience adverse consequences
3876187 while significant physical harm was rare adverse consequences for patients were common
3876188 this study strongly supports the need for office by office improvements in the overall testing process within primary care
3876189 since many errors are undetected or unreported we can assume this is an extreme lower bound

3876196 estamos m s tranquilos esta victoria era clave nos deja un sabor distinto espero que esto sirva para que el equipo siga creciendo pero m s importante para ganarle a croacia
3876197 croacia preocupa por c mo viene jugando est n en buena forma pero lo que me preocupa es que nosotros estemos bien no importa quien est por delante croacia o quien sea cuando uno est bien cuando va entrando en forma se va sintiendo mejor
3876198 s que ganaron y est n bien que est n metiendo mucho que no tienen grandes individualidades pero que est n en un momento b rbaro as que tenemos que mirarlos bien y hacer un gran partido porque nos estamos jugando la clasificaci n
3876199 croacia la est rompiendo la est metiendo much simo si le ganamos a croacia ah si estamos seguros
3876200 pero soy de la teor a de que a lo largo de un campeonato las estad sticas tienden a normalizarse as que no hay que confiarse s lo en ese dato pero s respetarlos
3876201 lo importante es seguir marcando como lo hicimos ante australia y tratar de que esos momentos buenos sean prolongados poder hacer buenos parciales como el del primer tiempo que nos dio comodidad para el resto del juego
3876202 con ee uu o como est espa a ahora no llegamos nunca como uno de los favoritos nunca lo hemos sido pero creo que al equipo le queda c modo venir desde atr s
3876203 estamos conscientes de que cuando entramos a la cancha venimos a defender una medalla de oro pero estamos conscientes tambi n de que hay otros equipos que est n viviendo un presente mucho mejor que el nuestro de que tenemos que seguir trabajando muy duro como lo hicimos ante australia para ganar todos los partidos dej ndolo todo en la cancha
3876204 en el mundial te puedes topar con equipos m s d biles pero hay que ser humilde hay que saber que ning n partido va a ser f cil y hay que salir a matarse dentro de la cancha
3876205 i would be inclined to be quite transparent about it
3876206 you dont hate one bug mom you hate all bugs thats why you dont go outside
3876207 you do hate hobo spiders mom and flying ants too
3876208 you never want to squish them yourself you always want me and dad to come and do it for you i think its because your a girl
3876209 yes we all know what bug you hate the most mom its an earwig
3876210 i dont know why you hate them and there is no funny story to tell its just funny that you hate them at all
3876211 oh yes i have always known that you hate earwigs
3876212 i remember when i was out on a date with louis and i got a call from you and you were practically screaming into the phone about how something was trying to get you i was scared at first until i realized that you were talking about a bug
3876213 then you got mad when i started laughing at you
3876214 i asked if i needed to come home to take care of it for you but you said that you haid put an empty soup can over the top of it and asked if i would just kill it when i got home
3876215 heck no i picked him up and took him outside and set him free
3876216 i have no use for the palestine liberation organization it is not a political organization it is a criminal organization and a very wealthy one at that any government which recognizes the plo is condoning murder and extortion
3876217 the notion of homeless palestinians is a myth some people who consider themselves palestinians are in fact homeless but a majority are not those arabs who lived in and continue to live in that part of palestine now called jordan are obviously neither homeless nor without a country those arabs who chose to remain in the area that became israel are not homeless and never have been
3876218 solutions can never come from myths they must be based on facts
3876219 the u s governments slavish support of israel brands us as a hypocrite and is responsible for most of the hostility toward the u s americans have been brainwashed into believing that its the arabs and the palestinians in particular who dont want peace that is a big lie israels goal is and always has been to take all of palestine and to get rid of the palestinians
3876220 t heres no group of people in the world who are more clearly victims of ethnic cleansing than the palestinian refugees who have been rotting in refugee camps for 50 years palestinians were ethnically cleansed in 1948 and again in 1967
3876221 the zionists in america are the biggest enemy of freedom of speech and freedom of the press there is
3876222 the israelis are to the palestinians like a 250 pound wrestler assaulting a 4 year old child without pressure from the u s the israeli government will go right on killing palestinians taking their land and expanding israeli settlements
3876223 who would have thought that we would become the rogue nation committing acts of aggression around the globe

3876242 cbs has a done a good job i think in terms of getting the blood system back on track they have a lot of infrastructure capability that we can leverage
3876243 i expect them to work very co operatively with their provincial partners and its going to be good for everybody
3876244 we have for some time been sharing organs across the country even internationally
3876245 we have understandings that if theres a high status liver recipient waiting in edmonton and we have a donor in ontario that the liver from our donor goes there on a priority basis
3876246 i think cbs will be in a better position to make those agreements standard but more important weve been operating till now with rather rudimentary information systems we get information by fax we get it by telephone
3876247 it refers to the situation where i need a kidney transplant i have a family member or a friend whos prepared to give me their kidney but they cant do it because their blood types dont match
3876248 so our thought here is can i trade with somebody else maybe you need a kidney too youve got a family member whos prepared to give a kidney to you but your blood types dont match but when we look at your donor and me and my donor and you the blood types do match so you can do a swap or an exchange
3876249 for every province its better to be doing this nationally because we all share in a bigger pool well all get more matches its an excellent program
3876250 destined to fail because it has no cost control whatsoever
3876251 many u s residents wrongly equate higher spending with better care
3876252 the notion that the more you spend the better you are in health care is a giant urban myth
3876253 the answer is allowing consumers to choose a consumer driven plan that meets their needs is better than forcing people into expensive plans with low cost sharing which the commonwealth connector board favors said herrick referring to the organization responsible for overseeing massachusettss government based health insurance program

3876259 pfuel was one of those hopeless opinionated arrogant men who would go to the stake for their own ideas self assured as only a german can be because only a german could be self assured on the basis of an abstract idea science the supposed knowledge of absolute truth
3876260 a russian is self assured because he knows nothing and doesnt want to know anything because he doesnt believe you can know anything completely a self assured german is the worst of the lot the most stolid and the most disgusting because he imagines he knows the truth through a branch of science that is entirely his invention pfuel was one of those theorists who love their theory so dearly they lost sight of the aim of all theory which is work out in practice he positively rejoiced in failure because failure was due to practical infringements of his theory which went to show how right the theory was
3876261 this was eloquently confirmed by the uncombed tufts of hair sticking up on the back of his head and the hurriedly brushed locks at his temples

3876268 the remaining residents of these destroyed ethnic georgian villages are facing desperate conditions with no means of survival no help no protection and nowhere to go
3876269 of course they are entitled to take things from georgians now because they lost their own property in tskhinvali and other places
3876270 isnt that what they georgians have been doing to us these old people shouldnt be complaining they should be happy they werent killed
3876271 acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population
3876272 the russian government should be held to this promise to punish looters but much more needs to be done to ensure that all sides protect civilians

3876274 our fourth quarter results reflect both progress and continuing challenges
3876275 we had a good revenue quarter reaching the upper end of our guidance and recording the highest quarterly revenues in the history of our company but we believe the market continues to show signs of softness and so we have taken decisive restructuring actions to resize the company in both of our business groups to enable the sustainable profitability and cash flows that investors expect from our combined ip businesses these restructuring actions along with the restructuring of our debt facility accomplished in the fourth quarter will when completed reduce our quarterly spending by approximately 5 million the write down reflects current market realities but our belief in the long term growth and strategic value of the chipidea analog business remains strong
3876276 republicans are coming together in support of senator obama to bring change to washington
3876277 with obama every answer is more than a little off
3876278 then what what is obama going to do for america and why is turning everything upside down a good thing
3876279 democratic party is growing in republican leaning benton county and county democrats will help presidential candidate barack obama carry arkansas and the nation said bill gwatney the arkansas democratic party chairman
3876280 you despite your enormous and historic achievements during the primary are to be shunted aside michelle obamas brother is given as much weight as you michelles brother what in gods name has he ever done to deserve such an honor
3876281 dishonorable people are not fit to give her honor the honor she has she earned and no one can take that away from her

3876288 indeed some of israels best friends and most articulate defenders can be found in the blogosphere little green footballs atlas shrugs hugh hewitt and debbie schlussel all provide a refreshing alternative to the moral relativism and politically correct anti israel blather of the media
3876289 we are perishing for want of wonder not for want of wonders
3876290 if you can become aware of the miraculousness which i symbolise you can help save the freedom mankind is unhappily losing
3876291 my films are misinterpreted all the time i dont mind that everybodys films are misinterpreted but theres no malice or stupidity in the people that misinterpret them
3876292 of course you have memories of such a big tournament and losing
3876293 hes a good player so im very happy with this win because i think this was the first true test in this tournament
3876294 if hes too good for me hes too good for me
3876295 every time at the beginning of each match ive felt like i could come out on top
3876296 its looking great for the americans the past couple of days
3876297 it would be great if we could finish up strong here and walk away with a few medals
3876298 i dont understand why we dont play such a big tournament over 10 days maybe i think this is asking just a little bit too much
3876299 you can lead a horse to water but you cant make him drink
3876300 you can put a toddler in bed beside you but there is no way on earth that you can make him take a nap
3876301 its quiet time you need to lay there quietly and be still
3876302 i was shocked and saddened to hear about the tragedy in arkansas were all grateful for the quick action of law enforcement and quick thinking by chairman gwatneys staff and michelle and i are keeping him and his family in our prayers
3876303 we are stunned and shaken by todays shooting at the arkansas democratic party where our good friend and fellow democrat bill gwatney was critically wounded bill is not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but he is also a cherished friend and confidante our thoughts and prayers are with bill and his family today and we wish him a quick recovery
3876304 you know if it were any other time of the year and you were watching televised swimming competition i would say you were gay but its the olympics so its ok
3876305 cancun exudes everything that ive never wanted in a vacation destination
3876306 rejection of the applications by placing undue reliance on the fact that the applicants are not living in japan is an abuse of discretion and is illegal
3876307 e c una cosa che io non ti ho detto mai
3876308 what i was hoping for with him and what i got is that he didnt use anything as an excuse
3876309 he put it all upon himself he didnt use the way the coach used him or injuries or being young when he came in the league none of that
3876310 he took responsibility for himself and really once he did that for me it was easy thats one of the biggest things to get athletes to hold themselves accountable whether he did that when he was 18 or 19 im pretty sure i was mature at 18 or 19 but i wouldnt have been ready to be thrown into a no 1 pick or right into the nba and handle that kind of responsibility whether he acknowledged responsibility at that time didnt really matter to me the fact that now he does is the only thing i want to judge him on
3876311 japan has been in an economic downturn since the end of last year and the downturn may last 12 to 18 months
3876312 i want you to swiftly study ways including taxation to encourage a shift from savings to investment
3876313 we will do everything the financial services agency can do
3876314 i thrust through the water quite well i cannot lose my tension from the warmup this morning my body was moving smoothly
3876315 after this race i thought i can do well in the 200 meter breaststroke final as well
3876316 my coach norimasa hirai said to me paolo bossini is fast in the last part
3876317 so i was asked by my coach to check out the surroundings for the first half but i said no i just want to do my own race but the last 50 meters i could swim by checking the surroundings
3876318 after i woke up this morning i thought i was tired
3876319 but my body is moving well better than i thought my condition is not too bad so tomorrow all i have to do is just go out there and perform without thinking about anything
3876320 i knew that i was having a close race with cseh i knew that i was racing him for the silver medal
3876321 i guess the color of the medal describes my effort for four years
3876322 i pursued phelps better than i thought i would he is a great swimmer and so i swam this race hoping to learn something from him
3876323 its like riding a bicycle its like i never left
3876324 i just wanted to go out and gauge how i feel
3876325 i felt ok i just got some new stuff orthotics in my shoes and this is the first day i ran in them my feet are a little sore right now so its something i have to get used to once i get used to it and get the soreness out ill be back out here
3876326 he felt better and decided to do a few things
3876327 according to ai nagai an nntt director who attended the selection meeting the meeting was first told by an nntt official that uyama didnt want to continue in his post
3876328 however as some directors were anxious for him to stay nagai sought confirmation that uyama didnt want to continue from nntt officials present at the meeting she only received an ambiguous answer
3876329 i am not afraid to say quite clearly that this situation is wrong and i would like to win back our public theater from bureaucrats and hand it back to artists
3876330 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3876331 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3876332 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3876333 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3876334 the panic and credit crunch caused by the u s subprime mortgage crisis hit the global financial market and led to a rapid deterioration in the japanese real estate investment market
3876335 it could have been a different result if we had won one more point
3876336 but were happy that we will play one more match here and i want to play in a way that we wont regret regardless of the result
3876337 we did have a good chance to win the game but they had better concentration than we did when it mattered most
3876338 i had a lot of japanese art and it made me happy so i decided to share it with people
3876339 i wanted to show how much japanese culture has influenced our society with anime animation
3876340 i read a lot of manga comics and watch anime so i really wanted to come check it out
3876341 its very interesting i came for the coffee but i can definitely see myself coming back
3876342 i get to meet tons of people and we have a lot of interesting customers because royal t brings in really creative individuals its different from other waitress jobs because you have to be in the know
3876343 i like the idea of a gallery and food space
3876344 i love murakamis work especially and i think the art space is absolutely beautiful
3876345 it makes my heart ache to see his arm bleeding after finishing his parallel routine
3876346 mate ive been living with that other blokes name for years it doesnt worry me at all
3876347 the u s market is certainly expecting mitsubishi ufj to increase the price
3876348 its certainly conceivable that mitsubishi ufj will have to raise its bid
3876349 attempts to commence negotiations over the past several months have been unsuccessful
3876350 cast significant doubt on our ability to continue as a going concern
3876351 north korea will set up a reinvestigation committee that will have authority
3876352 this committee will carry out the investigation in a quick manner and will as much as possible finish it by this fall
3876353 we discussed and confirmed the specifics of the reinvestigation including the form method and time
3876354 should there be any betrayal of the agreement or should the agreed contents not move in the determined direction the dialogue will break down
3876355 we did talk about these issues and we will continue to do so in the future
3876356 we failed to get any points from our first game and that meant we had to go on the offensive and i have no regrets about that
3876357 its just that we still lack composure around the penalty area
3876358 i just hope at least one player from this group will go on to establish himself in the senior national team
3876359 we have come all the way from the netherlands to hong kong qinhuangdao and shenyang and we are going to shanghai for the quarterfinals but we hope to end up in beijing in the final
3876360 its such a shame that having played so well the penalty decision by the referee has led to this result
3876361 coloque em ordem de import ncia os fatores que voc acredita ter influenciado sua longevidade
3876362 am i not a man and is not a man stupid im a man so i married wife children house everything the full catastrophe
3876363 where there is population and economic growth there are business opportunities for insurers and thats mainly in asia
3876364 its a given that japanese insurers wont have growth opportunities just looking at the domestic market
3876365 we expect the larger nonlife insurers to seek overseas opportunities
3876366 diversification of the business portfolio strengthens earnings and is important from a risk management perspective
3876367 the biggest challenge we face right now is to come up with a growth strategy at a time when the domestic market is stagnating
3876368 demutualization is preferable when it comes to expanding your business and raising funds
3876369 now is the time to plant the seed in order to survive
3876370 i dont think tokio marines purchase will be the last one
3876371 i dont feel any aches or any twitching or anything like that ive been staying hydrated and treating my body very well so im really confident that its going to hold up
3876372 id rather be 100 percent coming to the olympics than racing at 85 percent going to another meet
3876373 i dont really mind if people say im the underdog
3876374 coming off the hamstring injury that was pretty scary for me
3876375 they started this track thing i definitely understand what they did and what they stood for
3876376 i think the start will be very crucial but i dont necessarily consider it the no 1 key
3876377 the environments going to be difficult therell be a lot of pressure
3876378 asafa powell and usain bolt are looking good right now and running phenomenal times
3876379 so it has the possibility to be one of the fastest finals
3876380 with three guys that can run 9 7s anythings possible
3876381 i met him in new york he asked me to help him with his start
3876382 im pretty sure he has a little bit of pressure as well
3876383 we were in the gym and i asked him if i could take a picture with him so i could have it for memories
3876384 he said hows your leg im going to check you out ill keep you in my heart
3876385 he said he was going to come and check out the track meet that was crazy i text messaged my mother and told her it was just amazing this is the best experience ive ever had in my life
3876386 in order to beat him i have to run 9 6 most likely
3876387 thats kind of what i train my mind to do to run a 9 6
3876388 people can tell that we have a classic rock influence but they say it sounds modern at the same time
3876389 thats really the best spot for us to be in
3876390 the whole movie thing started with a co write i did with vocalist sammy james jr
3876391 we were touring with them at the time and i was filling in on guitar so i got invited to go out and do the filming with them
3876392 there is more production value more groove in the songs more confidence we werent going to try anything without thinking were the biggest band in the world
3876393 we got done with the record in mid june but were going back to record a couple more songs and mix the whole thing
3876394 we dont have a projected date for it to come out yet but it will probably be early next year
3876395 what really helps us is getting out on the road
3876396 myspace facebook the usual online outlets thats where we are connecting with people the music business doesnt really affect us right now we have taken our time with everything and done whats right for us
3876397 we really get into his music because hes a southern boy and his story is really a grassroots one the way he came up and worked really hard
3876398 hes had a career just by continuing to write good songs hes an inspiration to us in that way
3876399 boohoo i didnt get enough of an insurance settlement because i was too fucking lazy to go to the doctors and submit the paperwork boohoo i deserve to sit on my ass for 6 months on someone elses dime because i am special poor me
3876400 if you live for man then you can not live for god
3876401 we would like both russia and georgia to be participants in democracy with world powers and allies
3876402 scusi ma io ho bisogno di un biglietto o una ricevuta
3876403 deve andare a chiedere all information desk ma ora no
3876404 only one of the more than 100 research papers submitted in my classes on nanjing expressed anything but condemnation and contrition
3876405 im going to ask you to stop calling me black and im going to stop calling you a white man
3876406 but it remains legal in japan to possess child pornography for individual use
3876407 i am very proud to be able to do a small part to add to the great work chieko akiyama has done to bring the story of the faithful elephants to the world
3876408 it was an honor to take part i look forward to meeting chieko in person when my tour brings me to japan this september
3876409 i was happier with my win in athens this time however i feel that i really exerted myself to the fullest extent i feel relieved and filled with satisfaction
3876410 i wasnt able to perform well in any way today
3876411 if investigations will be done with the presumption that the abductees are alive and not dead then we will be entering a new phase
3876412 with that as leverage north korea is due to move
3876413 of course that was progress we are now moving toward action for action although we are still not there yet
3876414 north korea pledged to deliver results in its reinvestigation of its abduction of japanese nationals by this fall which is a very short time span this reflects their strong determination to make progress on the issue
3876415 if any of the abducted japanese are still alive it could happen between now and autumn
3876416 on the other hand if no progress is made despite the agreement it could be a crucial blow against forging diplomatic relations
3876417 based on the principle of action for action japan will have to lift part of its sanctions if north korea takes a step forward
3876418 the thing to watch now is how japan will react when north korea sets up its special investigative committee
3876419 severe conditions are likely to continue through the first half of next year
3876420 because the gdp growth rate was high in the previous two quarters it looks like the economy is growing moderately
3876421 but the nominal gdp shows the economy has been shrinking since the first quarter of 2007
3876422 the revenue of everybody is dropping the government businesses and individuals
3876423 with tax revenue likely to decline worries about social welfare costs will rise if the government debt balloons due to an increase in government bond issuance
3876424 im not sure if consumers will be motivated to increase spending under such circumstances
3876425 i used to drive to my hometown every year but have chosen to ride the shinkansen this year because gasoline prices are high
3876426 my salary stays flat but prices of various goods are rising i actually wanted to go overseas for my holiday
3876427 the gas prices are so high that i can understand why people are staying away from cars
3876428 at first the suits sold twice as fast as we expected now were running out of stock
3876429 due to the recent surge in crude oil prices and rising concerns about the environment electric bikes are attracting attention
3876430 but when the battery dies it suddenly becomes heavy probably heavier than a normal bicycle
3876431 by using electric bikes we have better communications with the people living here
3876432 the only thing humans rats and crows have in common is garbage
3876433 some of us were working as aidas assistants ellie modeled for some of his paintings and basically wed all just go out drinking together
3876434 got a gripe got no friends here is the contraption for you
3876435 when we found the rat in shibuyas senta gai the crow came from a
3876436 it was decided by the group while we were drinking one night
3876437 weve given him an emergency toilet which he can use without dirtying the room
3876438 when crows hear that sound and see the crow they think one of their mates has been caught by the humans
3876439 g3 is looking for the emergence of a new kind of baller for social responsibility and it all starts with this year leading up to the olympics in the basketball boom capital beijing
3876440 i felt that if youth in japan and china had the same dream to play in the nba and the same love for the game of basketball they could learn to interact with each other through fun sports based activities
3876441 the golden rule of street ball is this anyone can play regardless of race ethnicity gender skill level height and weight
3876442 it was going to be something like an all star team of street ballers and we would represent japan as youth sports ambassadors at the olympics in beijing
3876443 i was a little discouraged by the lack of support and sponsorship in the beginning but my close friends and family stayed behind me and a few professors at international christian university were really supportive throughout the whole process
3876444 the lack of support made things difficult for our recycle project and olympic trip mainly in terms of promotion and visibility
3876445 real street ball is playing with anyone whether you are 10 people or three people whether you know them or not
3876446 its not a package tour sort of trip that we are going on here its the real thing
3876447 we need to go there with the mind set that we are going to reach out and meet new people through the game we love to play it just takes a little courage
3876448 its not basketball to win its basketball to make friends
3876449 my dream is to play in the nba or anywhere as a pro
3876450 with young japanese people struggling to find their career path g3 provides community service experience for these individuals and hopefully in effect this serves to help japan better deal with global concerns such as poverty climate change and hiv
3876451 on the one hand we are helping young people develop leadership skills here at home and at the same time we are addressing global issues across borders
3876452 i think the media was like stumped that i was friends with the whole family
3876453 like mostly that demis ex husband and i were friends but bruce is a cool guy he loved demi thats the point i never subscribed to that unquestioned idea that when a marriage ends the wife and the husband are automatically some kind of enemies and never see each other again except like where their kids are concerned
3876454 its a real friendship its not necessarily what people expect like im not like some surrogate dad or stepdad cos for one thing were not so far apart in ages
3876455 i dont think most people really believed the whole thing was on the level till we did really get married
3876456 just fine like marriage is the most ordinary thing we all know that weve all seen our parents marriages and stuff like that once youre married it doesnt change very much maybe the thing it changes the most isnt about the two people in the marriage but how outsiders look at the marriage at the two people involved cos then they know theres a certain level of commitment
3876457 it does get boring just being on display theres not much creativity in stuff like that but its a great living and it beats the hell out of working in a factory or really most anywhere else
3876458 just producing like being an executive producer being really involved in putting on interesting stuff on tv thats great even if i wasnt acting besides i mean thats a whole career itself but i like acting too i think acting was like a natural extension from modeling cos its partly about your looks but you also get to use your voice and talent and body language and everything
3876459 cameron likes to have fun and shes a pro she knows a lot more about cameras and angles and scripts than youd ever think she started out as a model too and she told me some really wild stories stuff like how naive she was when she started out cos models dont get taken very seriously and theres so little to do in modeling so doing a movie is a whole different ball game we had a great time and it was fun to see the change that the script called for from rivals to lovers cos it changed for us too as the costars went from strangers to good friends and it was like a natural transition
3876460 the thing with scripts is unless like its from some famous play or shakespeare or whatever its not something you cant change the script was good from the get go but a movies not just about a blueprint which is all most scripts are i know that by now the director can improve things and the writer can be on set and be improving his own work and you have to like factor in what the actors bring to it not just the chemistry which i think is really terrific between cam and me but all the little touches and moves and the backgrounds and other actors and characters plus the action and the effects the jokes the whole atmosphere like vegas is fun city you know so this movie had a lot going for it from the get go
3876461 no way course not demis the biggest pro there is she was acting since she was a kid ive learned so much from her and from bruce too
3876462 if i succeed then demi succeeds and if she succeeds then i succeed cos thats what marriage is really supposed to mean
3876463 and my character hes someone everybody can identify with and you dont have to be young to identify hes like an everyman and if its a big hit we can have the two of us going on moving on from vegas to like anywhere you pick the location you get the same team to do a terrific script and gags and romance and sexy stuff and it could become a franchise and sure id work with cam again any time man
3876464 but critics and your peers rate you higher when you do more serious or moody stuff
3876465 one thing i liked right away about new york was how you get all kinds of uh environments
3876466 when i was modeling it was like so amazing to me what models made even more with the top ones and the most even with the top female models cos for sure they earn more than the male models do even the top guys
3876467 but i also want to give back you know return something cos like you said ive been lucky damn lucky i dont deny it
3876468 shes like always on a kind of diet and i can lose the weight real easy when it comes time to shoot but i love good food and when im with friends and were partying what am i gonna do watch everybody else eat im not that good of a host
3876469 i think homelessness is one of the big curses of our time
3876470 sometimes you ask yourself how can it even exist in a rich country but its there and theres so much of it and it seems to be increasing and chrysalis is one group thats really doing something about it i wish politicians would say more about homelessness and do more about it but i guess they figure homeless people dont vote very much
3876471 i got punkd i guess maybe i sort of had it coming
3876472 you know i never minded much being a teenybopper idol like that was as good a fan base as any only i wanted to move on and i did but yeah in my 30s i should be playing husbands and even dads more often and fewer kids college guys all that sort of stuff
3876473 these magazines take peoples lives and create mini soap operas out of them operating off not very good reporting
3876474 look at us its been reported that im adopting a baby or that im not that demi and i have issues in our marriage that were either pregnant or were not a kajillion things and its all a game of commerce
3876475 if a contributor lies to campaigns thats outside the control of the campaign

3876480 canadians can therefore expect to bear costs under the regulatory framework that are not trivial
3876481 at the same time these costs strike an appropriate balance between environmental results and manageable economic impacts
3876482 to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird i am speechless it started to sink in a little after the butterfly i was trying to focus on my next race but i kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty neat title and im definitely honoured when you have an olympic gold medal it stays with you forever it never gets old listening to your national anthem with a gold medal around your neck
3876483 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3876484 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3876485 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3876486 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3876487 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3876488 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3876489 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3876490 john tierney poses the question in the new york times before you dismiss the notion consider what were stuck with today a system designed to create a level playing field protect athletes health and set an example for children that fails on all counts the journal nature in an editorial in the current issue complains that antidoping authorities have fostered a sporting culture of suspicion secrecy and fear by relying on unscientifically calibrated tests like the unreliable test for synthetic testosterone that cost floyd landis his 2006 tour de france victory and even if the authorities manage to correct their tests they cant possibly keep up with the accelerating advances in biology

3876493 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3876494 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3876495 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3876496 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3876497 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3876498 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3876499 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3876529 this is obviously an outrage a terribly brutal act which i think should remind everybody of the brutality of the taliban and the danger that everybody there faces not just military people but all those who are there trying to help rebuild this country

3876560 but if you take all the chemistry thermal dymanics and theiries about carbon etc and take them down to basic priciples and back them up by the last hundred years of research and scientific findings then you update them with the mass of evidence from all of the recent studies if you do all this and you link to the studies the scientists and all of this is backed by facts the global warming hoax people

3876596 dear mr singer i dont think it had anything to do with my delightful luncheon with you yesterday but i must hurry to tell you in all seriousness that at about 1 00 last night i woke up to find a poltergeist in my bedroom the last one i saw was about 20 years ago it was not the same old chap i had seen three times before this was a new one not very scary not as flowing and gaseous as the first one i simply cocked a mean eye and dared him to move toward me fortunately he simply faded out and i was pleased i thought you would be interested to know about it

3876602 its a violation of the standards but it doesnt present a public health issue
3876603 its possible we dont know thats the detective work weve got to undertake
3876604 its a little bit too early for us to tell because they have 60 days to come up with a cleanup plan and as far as were concerned were going to go business as usual
3876605 were going to trust the health department to come in and i know theyre going to keep monitoring the whole situation
3876606 im concerned that when contamination is found the state seems to respond and cotter that those wells arent used but if they werent contaminated someone might use them that isnt a reason to feel ok about this
3876607 they said they could 25 years ago and everyone agreed they could and now look where we are
3876608 if they gamble everyone will be gambling if they can do it right this time i dont think its worth the gamble they are too close to a population

3876612 we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation
3876613 both in territory snatching outside and bureaucratic tyranny inside its chauvinism was beyond all bounds
3876614 the reason lado did this is because he knew the enormous pr value that georgia would gain by going to the money people and analysts particularly since georgia is clearly the aggressor this time
3876615 lado is a former banker himself so he knew that by framing the conflict for the most influential bankers and analysts in new york that these power bankers would then write up reports and go on cnbc and argue lado gurgenidzes talking points it was brilliant and now youre starting to see the american media shift its coverage from calling it georgia invading ossetian territory to the new spin that its russian imperial aggression against tiny little georgia
3876616 when violence broke out in the caucasus on friday morning john mccain quickly issued a statement that was far more strident toward the russians than that of president bush barack obama and much of the west but as russian warplanes pounded georgian targets far beyond south ossetia this weekend bush obama and others have moved closer to mccains initial position
3876617 obama accused russia of escalating the crisis through its clear and continued violation of georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
3876618 that russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
3876619 clearly there have been incidents on both sides but this is obviously a planned georgian operation a contingency plan they have had for some time to retake south ossetias capital tskhinvali
3876620 possibly the georgians calculated that with putin in beijing they could recapture the capital in two days and then defend it over the next two months because the russians wont take this lying down
3876621 russia should not be blamed for the fighting but russia should now be pressured not to go beyond its peacekeeping mandate and to ensure that armed militia do not cross the border into south ossetia
3876622 this pushed georgia into a philosophy of self reliance the idea that georgia will be able to regain breakaway entities only by its own means
3876623 the elephant in the room behind this whole story is georgias nato prospects
3876624 it might be a signal to the russians saying that the sochi olympics will not go the way russia wants if there is no progress on the settlement in abkhazia

3876872 patients with cardiovascular disease shouldnt exercise outside on days with increased air pollution levels on very polluted days they should consider staying inside and during the winter they should limit exposure to fireplace smoke
3876873 of course the real solution is to reduce air pollution

3876889 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
3876890 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
3876891 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
3876892 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

3876906 i dont think whole populations are villainous but americans are just extraordinarily unaware of all kinds of things if you live in the middle of that vast continent with apparently everything your heart could wish for just because you were born there then why worry if people lose knowledge sympathy and understanding of the natural world theyre going to mistreat it and will not ask their politicians to care for it

3876914 to go from a size 10 to a zero took hours of training a day fortunately though as cindy hensley mccain i have more money and more time than hillary so it was achievable
3876915 eight out of the 10 comments i get about cindy start off with well i dont really know her that well and dont know what she sounds like so right there my job is made easier obviously i want the impersonation to be a true as possible but at least at this point in the game it doesnt have to be as spot on to work
3876916 as a longtime vegetarian i dont really love wearing leather but with cindy i am probably going to have to put my morals aside and buy some cow at some point

3876941 it was an awesome experience to be cast in two original plays last winter
3876942 in florida it was a playwright competition but i knew these plays were tailor made for the red barn
3876943 it was an honor to portray evas father in the world premiere of forgotten memories muzzillo said
3876944 im thrilled to include it in eight by ten for local audiences to see
3876945 as soon as bill told me about his plans for eight by ten i polished up final draft and offered it to him
3876946 i eagerly studied the script and set his goals on finding parr for permission to produce the play
3876947 i not only received permission from parr but also discovered that he is originally from sturgis mich
3876948 its like unexpected bolts of lightning on stage a roller coaster ride for the audience and actors

3876954 in one sense its kind of brutal but in another sense its very hopeful

3876958 i personally think that their problem is that they want to control the end result too much and because of that they wont get any of the real advantages of open source
3876959 by choosing to place that code under an open source license a developer surrenders some of those rights to the community in the hopes of a beneficial exchange no open source license surrenders all rights
3876960 weve started getting our costs in line and getting cost competitive but we need to bring this company to the forefront of the industry lets not dribble it out or sit on our hands lets go for it

3876963 if you turned on your tv at 8 oclock the main logo ids for two of the three networks were pdi products
3876964 i figured at one point we had about a 60 share of the high end of that market not including all the local stations
3876965 wed done chrome glass stone plastic wed flown a logo from every possible direction we basically peaked
3876966 we have always held the position in the marketplace as a very high end supplier doing things that no one else can do
3876967 were at the leading edge because we have a combination of markets were working from
3876968 we had a pretty explicit vision of what we wanted and they carried it out exactly they also embellished and improved it they surprised us every step of the way
3876969 youre working on one or two projects at a time that last many many months theres not much opportunity for change
3876970 contrary to what sgi and various software manufacturers and suppliers would have you believe
3876971 you just cant go out and buy an indigo 2 and a suite of products from alias or wavefront plug it in get someone to animate it and voil you have jurassic park you need a ton of tools and a ton of glue to allow tools to talk to each other
3876972 if the only tool you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail
3876973 they havent been involved in many features they do great character animation in commercials but if youre going to do character animation in a feature film chances are there will also be models and creatures and miniatures and compositing and all that other stuff and they dont offer those other services
3876974 an ipo like pixars gets everyones juices flowing ours and investors
3876975 it used to be you had to fight to get the ear of potential clients
3876976 now they want to learn about using computer animation there are also many studios that want to be involved with this but cant because of pixars deal with disney
3876977 a fully computer generated movie but not a computer animated movie when you see it youll see what you perceive as an action packed live action film it just so happens that most if not all of it is computer generated
3876978 we want to do a kick ass effects film and obviously it has to have a great story and it has to be well directed but its going to have effects unlike what youve ever seen before we can do that because we know whats burning in the back room of the lab that no ones ever seen before
3876979 now its starting to make sense for us to do that
3876980 a lot of the animation tools are made so that when youre animating a scene with multiple characters in it multiple animators can work on the same shot at the same time if they laugh and giggle you could call that a multi player game
3876981 i spoke to a potential investor the other day who said is this an exit strategy for you if you get investors youre going to leave i said no its not then i said well yeah its an exit strategy for me from the standpoint that im taking the whole company with me when i go its an exit strategy for me personally because i want to do all this other stuff the company isnt doing right now but the best way for me to do that is for pdi to do that were going to change the whole damn company and were used to doing that its fun its cool and its interesting
3876982 it has taken many years to build confidence in this industry
3876983 more companies are getting into specific kinds of robots its not just about building hardware anymore but developing very intelligent abilities in our machines
3876984 but add them together and theyve made the robot a better performer
3876985 robots can carry bigger and heavier things robots can improve quality and production the microprocessing performance has a ripple effect that is just tremendous
3876986 robots are riding the same wave that took us from dos to windows where now we point and click
3876987 were delivering more in a user interface with more processing power
3876988 companies that have invested in this technology see it as their secret weapon
3876989 we were really surprised at how far they are willing to go to support our system
3876990 were collaborating with intel to produce a great experience on ultra mobile pcs were contributing the really cool software to make these devices really sticky and much more exciting for consumers quite frankly windows is not the most exciting environment
3876991 the best thing about these devices is the touch screen which gives you a tactile experience that your ipod doesnt give you
3876992 we designed glide to be optimized for a touch screen you can actually drag your finger across the screen to move your music and web sites i call it finger painting with media
3876993 cambridge animations immediate strategy is to focus on the professional market and migrate hand animators to ink and paint software and computers for the entire process of animation our products let people who do not know hand animation think about this medium clearly the market wants to integrate 2d and 3d so we need to work on integrating our product with 3d products both pc and sgi based it is not exciting for us to get into the 3d world as our competitive advantage is 2d we think there will always be a 2d world and the need for expertise in it
3876994 we have no plans to move into the interactive area as high resolution work has always been the hook of the company there may be a day when entire films are scanned into digital form to fix a scratch or add or subtract elements or just to achieve a certain look and compositing is another tool to extend the cinematic palette
3876995 our whole company is possible when a few years ago it wasnt because theres a new sheriff in town and his name is macintosh with about 40 000 worth of recently developed hardware and software we can produce work that previously required million dollar quantels black box special effects computers we are the first mac based company to deliver broadcast quality tv spots on an ongoing basis we do design copywrite special effects digital compositing and even music it is unique and a tremendous luxury for clients to have one company that comes up with the concept and executes it in house
3876996 our interest in content may be to bundle titles with ibm pcs or software or to sell them as a stand alone product from an investment point of view we have more interest in the underlying technology such as a 3d rendering engine although there has been far too much hype around the 3d and virtual reality revolution a few players are now beginning to deliver some tangible and exciting products in this area
3876997 brender is a very general purpose 3d engine its strongest advantage is its cross platform compatibility when developers develop on one platform using brender they can then port or transfer their work to other platforms or formats european digital hollywood power players argonaut technologies london u k jez san44181 200 5777 icven ibm europe paris franceandrew knox331 4188 6353 cambridge animation systems cambridge u k carolyn hayman441223 311 231 karzen communications los angeles camarc karzen213 461 5700 computer film company london u k dennis michelson44171 494 4673 rutherford ventures london u k carolyn hayman44171 490 3882 for instance content can be created on an sgi or pc for interactive television and then versions for sony playstation sega saturn mac power mac etc can be made a lot less expensively
3876998 brender also can be used for prototyping motion capture we have developed our own proprietary motion capture system because we have not found a commercially available system that does what we want
3876999 the technology could be souped up to make more sophisticated things you could see kids actually using it to make feature movies or games in their own homes
3877000 great but we dont really need the frame or covers the disk drives or power supply lets just talk about this board and of course all the software that goes with it
3877001 were quitting our jobs were going to go out and make this thing happen and were going to fund it ourselves if we have to
3877002 auspexs product is truly different from the other file servers auspex is the only company tohave efficiently overcome the i o bottleneck for large networks with a unique patented product called fmp this is the first system since the mainframe that an architecture has been specificallydesigned to handle many simultaneous users this revolutionary architecture is one of thefundamental reasons for our positive stance on the company the company further distinguishesitself with a conservative revenue recognition policy that also greatly enhances its overallefficiency and operating performance by avoiding the traditional hockey stick phenomenon whenthe vast majority of business is shipped in the last few weeks of the quarter we anticipaterevenues of 21 7 million for the june quarter up 51 from a year ago earnings of 0 10 pershare over 0 06 cents a year ago and revenues of 73 million for fiscal 1993
3877003 we still get a lot of disbelief but we have this vision for our technology and we want to see it through what is frustrating is that weve had to wait so long
3877004 we didnt realize that the japanese group owned a lot of analog transducer companies and they were only interested in tying up our patents that was very frustrating to us
3877005 they wanted to get us to focus on just one market and one technology whereas we saw very broad opportunities
3877006 and they always wanted to own more than half the company and take control we felt they were short sighted
3877007 eds just a positive thinker always coming up with new ways that the technology can be used in something new
3877008 we think that it could be useful in making a kind of magical experience for our guests
3877009 ed came in and showed it to our engineers and they just sat in silence with their jaws dropped
3877010 we arent sure what we want to do with it yet when i first heard about it i said yeah yeah yeah i got some waterfront property for you it took me a while to realize that this wasnt smoke and mirrors it was real
3877011 i think this has good promise but i think ed has to decide whether to go for the hail mary pass or just get the technology into some industry fast
3877012 i want to see a working antenna for my cars
3877013 it not only has to work and be beautiful it has to fit into the standard antenna technology or we cant use it
3877014 were like the real estate developer waiting for the land boom
3877015 the railroad is going to come through this town someday we just have to wait for it to come
3877016 it was a great privilege to work with the dignity fund and microcredit enterprises to arrange and structure this facility

3877020 our collaboration with unitus and the dignity fund shows the value of combining resources in order to bring more opportunity to the poor
3877021 one of the exciting things about our partnership with unitus is their ability to connect us with important new sources of capital with this investment well be able to bring financial services to tens of thousands more people who yearn to improve their lives if only given the chance were now going to provide that opportunity
3877022 we are looking forward to being able to serve the needs of our growing portfolio of unitus microfinance partners by leveraging his extensive knowledge and experience of debt and equity capital markets across asia
3877023 i am thrilled to be joining such an extraordinary team that is committed to making an impact on todays most pressing issue global poverty im particularly excited to be based in india and working throughout asia where the need for quality financial services is so huge and the effect can be life changing
3877024 this year weve seen an explosion of diverse experiments many of them engineered by onetime wall street heavies that attempt to bring new capital and capital market dynamics to the realm of social good
3877025 through these deals social entrepreneurs and businesses are raising the stakes creating both business and social impact and changing old style capitalism as we know it
3877026 starting in the 1970s experimental programs in bangladesh brazil and a few other countries extended tiny loans to groups of poor women to invest in micro businesses this type of microenterprise credit was based on solidarity group lending in which every member of a group guaranteed the repayment of all members these microenterprise lending programs had an almost exclusive focus on credit for income generating activities in some cases accompanied by forced savings schemes targeting very poor often women borrowers
3877027 microfinance has the power to transform lives families and communities but its just not getting to people quickly enough
3877028 as an industry we must act boldly to create the kind of rapid dramatic results needed to reach the hundreds of millions of families who still lack access through the heroic work of our partners on the ground the unitus acceleration model is helping close this financial services gap faster than ever before we are thrilled that our partners have added more than 2 6 million new microfinance clients over the six short years that weve worked together with them we remain focused on helping them reach millions more who still lack the opportunity to build a better life
3877029 unitus brings innovative thinking and expertise to the field of microfinance providing its partners with the resources necessary to expand the impact of microfinance on global poverty
3877030 the excellent caliber and extensive expertise of unituss microfinance institution mfi partners provided a focused opportunity for us to test our strategies against the realities on the ground so that we can increase our effectiveness and our contributions to the industry
3877031 the unitus leadership summit illuminates the critical issues that microfinance institutions face today creating scale finding talent and building the operational infrastructure to support growing operations
3877032 by engaging industry leaders in collaborative problem solving unitus is driving the evolution of a new breed of sustainable microfinance institutions that are rapidly closing the gap in the supply of financial services for the worlds working poor
3877033 ive observed many ceo summits and this is the most open summit ive seen
3877034 there was a lightness of spirit and a brotherhood among people with a similar vision and mission we learned that even high level practitioners experienced the same challenges which gave us new confidence we will leave with clear lessons in management information systems growth human development and financing we really have a clear path for future growth
3877035 these impressive leaders are raising the bar for growth and innovation for the entire microfinance industry
3877036 during this summit they shared deep insights on what it truly takes at the ground level to rapidly scale up market based solutions to global poverty
3877037 this is one of the most prestigious rankings in the microfinance industry to date
3877038 we congratulate the impressive leadership teams of bandhan grameen koota and sks were proud to see that the incredible work of our partners on the ground is being recognized and promoted to a savvy audience of investors we are honored to work with such dedicated institutions and hope that this ranking serves as a springboard for further growth and recognition for these mfis and others around the globe

3877041 unitus congratulates partners bandhan grameen koota and sks for ranking among forbes top 50 microfinance institutions

3877043 we consider ourselves very fortunate to have an exceptional leader of ed blands caliber joining us ed had a lot of choices about where he could go next and his desire to work at unitus is a powerful statement about his personal commitment to making our world a better place with ed as coo were excited about creating even greater impact in the fight against poverty

3877079 la guerra no terminar hasta que salga el ltimo ocupante
3877080 he tomado la decisi n de suspender las operaciones para obligar al gobierno georgiano a pactar la paz el objetivo de la operaci n para imponer la paz se ha cumplido la seguridad de las tropas de paz y de los ciudadanos rusos est garantizada
3877081 el ltimo punto del acuerdo dec a que el futuro estatuto de abjasia y osetia del sur debe ser discutido en un proceso internacional y esto se retir con nuestro acuerdo de los rusos y franceses porque se prestaba a diferentes interpretaciones
3877082 no queremos dejar planear ninguna duda acerca de que la integridad territorial y la pertenencia de osetia del sur y abjasia a georgia nunca ser puesta en entredicho por ning n tipo de proceso internacional
3877083 es una modificaci n aceptada por el presidente ruso medvedev

3877087 all things being equal right now and given the fact that you differ with the president so strongly on this tax cut and on some of these spending issues would you ever consider challenging him for the republican nomination next year
3877088 no no but look the president and i agree on most issues there was a recent study that showed that i voted with the president over 90 percent of the time higher than a lot of my even republican colleagues
3877089 there should also be a united nations mediator to address this crisis and the united states should fully support this effort we should also convene another international forums to condemn this aggression to call for an immediate halt to the violence and to review multilateral and bilateral arrangements with russia including russias interest in joining the world trade organization

3877091 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
3877092 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
3877093 if it is an underlying problem with the processor that makes repairing it either difficult or impossible if that is the case that could be a disaster for apple
3877094 in any case the 3g performance is obviously a problem
3877095 sitting on your hands and either not discussing the issue publicly or claiming there is no problem when a firestorm of people are online complaining about difficulties means the inferno is just going to get bigger and bigger
3877096 if apple finally does admit there is some sort of systemic issue the result would be disastrous
3877097 apple installing a kill switch and not telling anyone caused a firestorm in the application developer community online
3877098 not a peep that the project is being targeted for cuts
3877099 the minister has told us that this is iarnr d ireanns number one priority because he wants to get it done

3877119 wed have to find a parking spot close because thats hard on us older folks to walk far the 63 year old man said
3877120 its a little bit better for us to ride than to walk
3877121 it just doesnt make sense redskins vice president karl swanson said
3877122 pretty big loophole when it came to drawing the line between public transit services and private companies
3877123 why should taxpayers subsidize for profit organizations like professional sports teams that can well afford to pay for shuttle services fta spokesman david longo wrote in reply to the aps questions
3877124 transit agencies have historically charged less than market rates for its charter services because of the federal subsidy and usually another subsidy from the event sponsor
3877125 open and transparent process he said independent bus owners now have a chance to compete fairly
3877126 if anything this is going to be a win win for game day ridership because you have true market competition delivering the bus service at the best price shosteck said
3877127 the system that theyve set up now what weve seen is it allows a very small distinct portion of the private operators to really skew the industry larusch said
3877128 what were being told by this regulation is we cant do it anymore said barry barker tarcs executive director
3877129 weve got to turn it over what were trying to do is make sure its turned over in as effective a manner as we can would we like to be able to continue to do it absolutely

3877135 we got together in the locker room and gave him a big hug and just told him how we felt about him
3877136 hes too passionate just to give it up like that said villanueva the milwaukee bucks forward
3877137 he loves the game he loves the game so much hes going to ride this thing until the wheels fall off ill tell you that
3877138 hes a relentless personality a relentless coach and he just never allows himself to give in to anything blaney said
3877139 he attacked this the way he attacks the game and the way he attacks life and didnt let anyone feel sorry for him
3877140 on the court hes crazy but off the court hell do anything for you gay said
3877141 all the guys who played at uconn have calhouns voice in there mind somewhere in the back of their head somewhere as they are moving throughout life whether doing something right or wrong allen said
3877142 you know that there is something that he instilled in you that allowed you to be who you are today
3877143 when you get to july 1 terms and dollars you dont want to go there but sometimes you go there
3877144 when you make a trade or draft a player you want guys to have a passion to bring in that player
3877145 if you throw me in the lineup in that series its definitely going to make the difference
3877146 i cant think of a team out there with a bigger window weve made great strides the last couple years and the losing is building up that frustration
3877147 you havent done that yet i really need you to get on it
3877148 you know you and your father are a lot alike
3877149 what will i want to listen to when i finally sit down to write this paper of mine
3877150 two summers ago a contingent of hizbullah soldiers entered israel captured two israeli soldiers and then mission accomplished returned to lebanon
3877151 israel retaliated by land sea and air killing more than a thousand lebanese
3877152 and the bush administrations position on russias response to georgias attack upon south ossetia
3877153 no matter the hundreds of russian citizens reported to have killed by the georgians
3877154 what about the hundreds of georgians who may have been killed by russian troops and aerial bombardments
3877155 a crime against humanity according to the u s government
3877156 which means that two years ago in response to the capture of two idf soldiers it was acceptable for israel to go to war against lebanon but that in response to the murder of hundreds of its citizens this past week its not ok for russia to hit back at georgia for having launched the surprise attack that caused said deaths

3877158 all of the sudden he comes from around the corner two to three feet away and said you need to watch your mouth
3877159 he was dressed like a firefighter and i wasnt about to let somebody i didnt know make me go outside with him
3877160 he tried to talk to her but he didnt have a choice
3877161 there were people standing around kids and parents wondering if he was going to do anything about this
3877162 if she would have said yes sir there would have been no problem and she would have been able to walk off but there was not really much else he could do he has to uphold the law
3877163 i probably wouldnt have acted that way if i knew what was going on
3877164 it happened so fast i didnt know how to react he was being a real smart ass himself
3877165 i told him only when people are treating me wrongly
3877166 i get tired of cops always having an attitude right off the bat
3877167 its not like i robbed anybody to have that attitude with me when all i did was cuss
3877168 you just cant go off swearing and hollering you just cant do it
3877169 the african american community is as american as apple pie
3877170 we are deeply concerned over the deteriorating situation in indian occupied kashmir which is resulting in loss of life and property of the kashmiri people and violation of their human rights

3877181 by showcasing our extensive range of whole house brands in a disruptive setting we believe we can pay a respectful tribute to fashion where it comes to life each season and still offer an aspirational lifestyle that is inclusive the installation will play off our autumn campaign fallforward providing context for the ideal of designing for the future but living in the moment
3877182 certainly the death penalty could be sought in every capital case tried but that would clearly be a decision made without regard to thought of anything other than emotions
3877183 it makes no sense but points out even more so why we must look at case law in our evaluation process
3877184 if we do not i can almost promise you nrg is going to be tired of the city and say were trying to give you some canals
3877185 my soul thirsts for the living god when shall i come and appear before the face of god

3877216 the trick of starting in the middle is extremely useful in fiction by beginning at a point where events are already in motion you involve your reader in the flow of action and get him caught up in your fiction right away then you can back off and let him know what it is hes gone and gotten himself interested in
3877217 april 24 they brought him into the green room and outside all he could see was gray

3877257 the russians could drive up to the gates of the georgian capital tbilisi without encountering anyone in their way
3877258 what we found somewhat to our surprise is that both groups of people whether they were treated with stenting or medical therapy that over one to two months they all had substantial improvement in quality of life
3877259 we also found there was some advantage in being treated with stenting but not over time
3877260 the conclusion is that people are going to get better and there is some advantage to stenting but it is not that large the majority of people can be treated with medical therapy alone
3877261 so the courage trial tells us that in this low risk population we should try medical therapy first and if it fails we should move on to coronary stenting
3877262 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie

3877273 just as i become the manifestation of either my own distorted self image or positive capable confident self image so do people around me take on my projected expectations of them
3877274 but i do think my perception of an interaction is different based on the positive or negative energy with which i enter into it and if im expecting negative thats probably what ill take from it

3877289 vigilante has really grown in stature beyond its theatrical run that would define what a cult movie is on video it got a wider audience than in theaters we could see it continuing to grow on video

3877295 ive never been as excited about cinema as during that period
3877296 catalog movies are not a renewable resource i was doing it for myself if i wanted to see these movies there must be other people out there that want to see them sometimes the most vocal people are the smallest audience so i dont always go by which films are being asked for the most

3877307 as to whether the recent violent attacks have any links with terrorist forces there is evidence to indicate that east turkestan forces may be behind these events
3877308 are not the kind of coordinated terror attacks that are being orchestrated by some kind of organization inside or outside of china

3877320 during an international crisis when bipartisanship is needed most its disappointing that the obama campaign has chosen to launch inflammatory and baseless political attacks
3877321 it is the absolute height of hypocrisy for the mccain campaign to play the victim after launching attack after attack on barack obama for his strong and appropriate response to the conflict in georgia but its characteristic of the old washington tactics that have failed the american people
3877322 hes on third base but so far he cant seem to find a way to get home
3877323 but too many voters are concerned about obamas experience and dont yet have enough confidence in his ability to lead
3877324 when this crisis began barack obama the administration indeed and all of our nato allies took a measured and reasoned approach because we were dealing with the facts as we knew them
3877325 john mccain shot from the hip very aggressive very belligerent statement and he may or may not have complicated the situation
3877326 and thats in part because we have been focused on iraq and our foreign policy has now become monolithic

3877333 the rebel military installations and civilian areas are mixed if the army advances further and confines the rebels into a smaller region then civilian vulnerability will increase
3877334 there are no restrictions and there is no shortage we send food and other essentials as per the request of the senior government official in those areas
3877335 the silence of the international community especially by neighbouring india over the displacement and suffering of tamils is disturbing
3877336 thats the problem with distributed denial of service attacks its really hard to identify the actor
3877337 have experience from the recent attacks of last year that took place against estonia
3877338 the attacks are quite similar in nature there for we have been successful in using some of the lessons learned from april 2007
3877339 as we all know the attribution is what is so unpleasant and dangerous with cyberattacks
3877340 when you take a look at conventional warfare there are no questions or very few questions about attribution but when we look at cyberwarfare attribution is complicated
3877341 he doesnt get it the mere fact that you would have someone compare the circumstances now in the past or in the future of iraq to the ending of world war ii and the ending of the korean war absolutely demonstrates a total fundamental lack of understanding of what the problems america faces
3877342 and the notoriously loquacious biden and his campaign team has been preternaturally quiet over the past few weeks a silence that is fueling rumors that he is the pick
3877343 there is no case for biden while he is on the money with the issues and the realities of the issues he has no problem towing the party line and partisonship wich makes him arrogant and a loser
3877344 obama has reopened the rcp gap to 4 6 with only rasmussen showing less than a 3 lead and seeing as how rasmussen has been about as accurate as a magic 8 ball during this election cycle im not so sure that its worth using

3877355 we are endeavoring to discover the full facts of this incident and if necessary will raise our concerns with the appropriate authority

3877362 we are committed to a solution that recognizes that the people spoke on the 29th of march 2008 a solution that ensures tangible deliverables are put on the table of zimbabweans a solution must thus put the people first not leadership positions and titles
3877363 we are indeed convinced that it is possible to conclude these negotiations quite quickly

3877376 it wasnt working out adrian saw her with shia and that was kind of it the crash their hanging out he obviously didnt appreciate it
3877377 it seems to me that if mr obama wins the presidential election then messrs farrakhan wright ayers and pfleger will gain power for their need to demoralize this country and help create a socialist america
3877378 we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3877379 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
3877380 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3877381 it lets us get deeper into some of the other characters that only have very small stories generally so i always enjoy em i think people like to see whats going on with some of the characters who only get grunts or reactions when michael says something stupid

3877384 the first one is live trapping followed by providing the live animals to rabbit rescue groups or to wildlife shelters the second one is live trapping followed by lethal injection which is akin to putting an animal down in a veterinary facility the third one is the use of an air rifle and the euthanized animals would be provided to wildlife shelters food its a high powered air rifle that i guess is similar to a regular one except for the fact it doesnt make the same noise
3877385 we agree with some of the groups that we would like to try to preserve as many of the animals as we can but we feel there are too many to rescue them all and have them spayed or neutered we understand that tracs has rescued up to 250 animals which is great
3877386 thats a major concern because they can cause major damage in the agricultural community thats already happened at one farm where theyve attacked the young apple trees
3877387 we are working as quickly and as safely as we can to get the unit working but first we need to investigate just what happened we are doing that at this time and as soon as we figure it out and repair whatever needs to be repaired well get that unit producing gas again
3877388 we have dedicated people working to contact alternative suppliers to get more product from elsewhere were stretching out traditional supply boundaries to get more gas in from other areas both in canada and offshore in short we know this stuff is important to people and were doing our best to minimize the situation
3877389 due to unforeseen circumstances the catalytic cracking unit a key part of gasoline production at edmonton refinery had to be shut down last week
3877390 this has limited the supply of gasoline forcing petro canada to temporarily reduce the volume of gasoline delivered to customers and associates as a result customers in alberta and the interior of british columbia may notice outages of gasoline at some petro canada retail sites

3877460 we always understood that soldiers traveling on duty were reimbursed by the military for the fees on required excess baggage

3877462 isp is truly excited to establish this new relationship with the university of arkansas one of the great athletic programs in the country
3877463 we also are excited about being able to work with katv and building on the 40 year tradition katv has established in bringing the passion of razorback athletics to the state of arkansas
3877464 we are pleased that through our new agreement with isp katv will remain at the forefront of razorback coverage for many years to come
3877465 we have enjoyed our four decade partnership with the university of arkansas and are looking forward to maintaining that relationship moving forward via our partnership with isp as the continuing home of the razorbacks
3877466 from the beginning of our discussions with katv and isp i was excited about what the partnership would mean for razorback athletics
3877467 i have worked with a number of other multi media rightsholders but in my opinion isp is the best and is clearly the leader in college sports
3877468 our agreement with isp not only helps protect us from uncertain financial times but also guarantees revenue at a significantly higher level than what we have generated in the past
3877469 as our budget continues to reflect the increasing costs associated with operating a 19 sport program the increased revenue generated from this partnership will help us secure the essential funding to support our more than 450 student athletes and provide them the resources to succeed in the southeastern conference and nationally

3877489 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3877490 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3877492 they seemed like a really nice family they were never fighting when i saw them outside
3877493 theyve always been so good they keep their house perfect

3877522 the massive database that would be created by the real id act containing all manner of private information on citizens is potentially one of the most privacy invasive laws in the history of our country

3877528 a national id system requires a complex integration of social and technical systems including humans to enter and verify data plus hardware software and networks to store and transmit such socio technical systems are always vulnerable to error breakdown sabotage and destruction by natural events or by people with malicious intentions for this reason the creation of a single system of identification could unintentionally result in degrading the overall safety and security of the nation because of the unrealistic trust in the efficacy of the technology we must ask whether there is now a secure data base that consists of 300 million individual records that can be accessed in real time the government agencies which come close are the internal revenue service and the social security administration neither of which are capable of maintaining a network that is widely accessible and responsive to voluminous queries on a 24 hour by 7 days a week basis

3877530 one of the most surveilled people in history were the soviets under communist rule during stalins decades long reign of terror and the kgb era that followed government agents could intercept and read mail listen in on phone calls and plant informants to probe their neighbors political views and assess their loyalty to the state the surveillance was near complete but did the watchful eye of the state keep the soviet people safe hardly it seems no coincidence that historys most watchful regime was also one of its most deadly between 1917 and 1987 the soviet government killed over 60 million of its own citizens more than any other government in the 20th century

3877546 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3877547 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3877548 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3877549 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3877550 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3877551 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3877552 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3877553 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3877554 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3877555 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3877556 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3877557 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3877558 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3877559 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3877571 to have pulled you together very quickly and said that something happened but not be able to say what happened and not be able to say the steps were going to take would have been very fruitless

3877578 if we could just tick a box and move on it would make everyones life easier but now this really is a long term behavioural and educational campaign
3877579 we know theres a bunch of guys that are here that are going to be here and they need to play more
3877580 a guy like derek hagan needs to take more plays in a row ted ginn needs to take more plays in a row right now
3877581 were going to take a long look at it but its going to be something comfortable
3877582 well have to see where he is tomorrow that will be a deciding factor
3877583 we look at this opportunity to start to get the players ready to play that we feel really comfortable with that are going to be on our team
3877584 at the end of this game the picture will be a lot clearer

3877590 its a good feeling for now ive got a lot of things to work on its still a learning experience for me
3877591 ive got to work on my kickoffs and keep going with the field goals
3877592 youve got to like his poise and leadership in the huddle
3877593 no reporters asking why both beck and mccown are getting barely any snaps
3877594 jason taylor was on what show and hes now a redskin
3877595 miami let zach thomas go and now hes with the cowboys
3877596 next thing youll be telling me is brett favre is playing for the lousy stinkin jets now
3877597 hes definitely the future at qb for us right now
3877598 no one bothered to answer my question about ricky in the single back vs ronnie in the i thats ok
3877599 gholston won the last meeting during the buckeyes 14 3 victory against the wolverines he finished with three sacks including the only one long reportedly allowed all season
3877600 theyre going to give john two more weeks to show what he can do but if he continues his awful play hes out of here
3877601 hes been terrible throughout camp and theres no way four quarterbacks are going to make the final roster hes not one of executive vp of football operations bill parcells guys and they have no loyalty to him
3877602 foster will be lucky to make the practice squad and even thats not a given
3877603 wrong you have way more than 53 players on that list

3877607 i have more of a chance of banging jessica alba than brown or dotson making the team
3877608 jahndoh lets be honest theres no trade option for beck what can we get for him
3877609 dont even be surprised if its a team trading up to grab him
3877610 were not even halfway through training camp why would we shelve a young qb who needs development
3877611 while were waiting for updates what does everyone think of the jets shortening tail gate times from 7 hours to 5 hours i like a little warm up as much as the next guy but ive never been at the stadium at 5am those silly jets fans
3877612 jeff ireland the general manager said that they almost took me twice in the sixth and the seventh rounds he said
3877613 noodle arm is going to take ginn out of the long game
3877614 i think soliai will be cut if we find anything better than him which is likely
3877615 or maybe henne should pull his head out of his arse before hes run out of town
3877616 actually jahndoh it was a drop that hagan had not a fumble it was overruled so yes that did show me his normal self
3877617 jahndoh when are you going to admit that you were wrong about beck and i was right the entire time
3877618 the fast turnaround and extra attention they paid to my submissions was well worth the money
3877619 i received calls from people interested in my new business within hours of paying for a submission

3877621 he was very accurate today putting the ball on point thats what you want from your quarterback
3877622 to him the plays are kind of second nature and he just has to look at the coverage
3877623 but he threw a touchdown pass on a fade to davone bess who jumped over chris roberson to get it it was a beautiful catch and throw

3877642 this game will also afford me a chance to see the players in a game situation as i have only just come into the team and need to understand how each player responds
3877643 im personally very happy and i hope ive made the chelsea fans happy ive had seven great seasons here and now i can have many more
3877644 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of the frustrating things a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
3877645 my world got turned upside down and i dont think it is anything anyone appreciates until you go through it
3877646 i feel for sure ive made 100 percent the right decision for myself for my family and for chelsea football club
3877647 this has always been a very important contract for me ive just turned 30 and i see it as my final big contract to see my playing days out at chelsea
3877648 i am delighted that frank has committed his future to the club
3877649 he is a key player for me and vital to chelseas future successes
3877650 frank is one of the best professionals i have worked with everyday he tries to learn something and bring new elements to his game
3877651 these are big issues for the club for frank and any other player
3877652 whatever has gone on i think there is that underlying desire that we get there its taken both frank and the club longer than we originally thought
3877653 it allows us to kill all the speculation of the last 18 months and allows us to concentrate on the really important thing next season
3877654 it is bound to be the case there will be a quarter or two of negative growth
3877655 the committees forecasts for gdp growth now envisage the economy broadly stagnating over the next year or so
3877656 however there is a clear chance that the economy slows even more sharply than this business surveys are already warning of the danger that the economy actually contracts in the second half of the year
3877657 the british economy is going through a difficult and painful adjustment to higher energy and commodity prices and in banking credit and housing markets
3877658 this adjustment to our economy cannot be avoided and as a result inflation is rising and growth is slowing
3877659 while we would not rule out a cut in british rates in november particularly if the economy slows markedly further and oil prices continue to retreat we are maintaining our view that interest rates will stay at 5 00 per cent until early 2009
3877660 however we then expect interest rates to come down markedly in 2009 to 4 25 per cent by mid 2009 and to 3 75 per cent by the fourth quarter of next year
3877661 the two presidents decided to establish diplomatic relations at the level of ambassadors in line with the treaty of the united nations and international law

3877663 assad has instructed all concerned syrian officials that he wants this visit to be successful and fruitful

3877667 what they have done or plan to do about tapping into the knowledge experience of boomers as they approach retirement
3877668 ys when faced with a new challenge tend to function like a heat seeking missile single mindedly pursuing the person in the organization with the most relevant experience in many cases this person is a boomer often in some distant part of the organization or several hierarchical levels removed this approach reflects how ys like to learn from an expert just in time and in response to the specific challenge they need to address and it reflects their comfort in relating to boomers on a peer basis developed over an adolescence of friendly interaction with their parents and parents friends
3877669 boomers are finding they enjoy the questions once they get over the shock of receiving emails or text messages from very junior employees and the obvious recognition of their expertise they are even learning a lot themselves new ways of communicating and thinking about getting things done
3877670 to make knowledge transfer efforts more salient pair up out going workers with promising gen y and xers giving their presentations together will spice up the lesson one way to do it is by having the gen y or xer interview the retiring chieftain about his her legacy and the companys upcoming challenges then have the old guy gal on the block pose a few questions to the fledgling rather than let a perhaps partly loved partly loathed executive get away with self congratulatory rambling for an hour this give and take approach is potentially more substantive whether savior or ogre you thought enough of them to capture their wisdom they shouldnt mind fielding a few questions about their corporate savior ogre methodology

3877733 with less than two weeks to go before the start of the presidential nominating conventions barack obamas lead over john mccain has disappeared pews latest survey finds 46 of registered voters saying they favor or lean to the putative democratic candidate while 43 back his likely republican rival in late june obama held a comfortable 48 to 40 margin over mccain which narrowed in mid july to 47 to 42
3877734 obama born just after alan shepard became the first american in space would have a hard sell to convince a board of directors at a big company that hes not unseasoned mccain would have a tougher sell as someone so seasoned that he was born before pilot amelia earhart vanished trying to circumnavigate the globe

3877738 theyre over there fighting for my freedoms which i enjoy very much and theyre leaving their families and their wives and most of them have smaller children
3877739 theyre over there worrying about their life for one thing but on the other hand theyre worrying about what their children and their wives are going through if i can help them that way then thats a little less worry that they have
3877740 i asked them why they thought they needed to do that and they said it was to ease the pain of us being gone and that it was a small price to pay for what we were doing
3877741 its too bad all employers arent this good to work for and its easy to see how easy it is to work for them for 26 years
3877742 you go to work every morning knowing that you work for good people
3877743 theres no other employer that tops them they deserve the red carpet treatment from the army for what they do
3877744 theyre all pretty humble people anyway but when they come back theyre so appreciative
3877745 with the other people listening to them out there on a daily basis i think it makes the other people better americans and makes them appreciate what they really have here
3877746 its a great honor for me to be selected as one of the recipients
3877747 for my employees to nominate me for that that was an awesome thing im just proud to be a part of it
3877748 i know our show isnt exactly frontline but we definitely tried to weed as much comedy into the situation as possible because these men and women let me know very quickly that when youre dealing with these kinds of injuries you just gotta laugh
3877749 what im proud of with this show is that it shows how people use humor to cope with a traumatic situation
3877750 you always need a couple of ticked off chaplains combined with some laughing soldiers and a couple er nurses
3877751 what really got me involved was when a friend of mine kerri turner from the television series
3877752 she told me that the trip would change my life and she was right it did
3877753 my goal this year with the walter reed episode is to have these men and women seen for the heroes they are and their families for the human beings they are
3877754 this experience shows us what happens to these brave men and women when they come home and deal with the injuries they have sustained while at war i saw the bravery from the moment i walked into fisher house to the rehab facility to the little show i put on that night
3877755 at this point i have basically put the army through hell i believe they call my crew the insurgency but i wont stop
3877756 i visit with returning soldiers before each show i do on the road i am so happy to be involved with performing for the armed forces and meeting them whatever i can do
3877757 we are unbelievably excited to be playing in christl arena
3877758 it will be a great atmosphere fans and teams alike were hoping for a great turnout and i can promise some high quality volleyball for those in attendance
3877759 now i can just have fun and whatever happens happens
3877760 we are extremely pleased with the numbers rolling in but we still want to hit the 10 000 mark in 2008
3877761 im so proud of the entire wright patt team which has been completely behind the success of the marathon for the past 11 years and wants to make 2008 a milestone
3877762 the most recent advancement in this research is the ability to selectively pattern the coating and spatially control the wetting behavior for a desired application
3877763 this allows us to define the pathways along which water droplets will roll
3877764 our concept of a supreme complete entity which used to restrain our passions and our irresponsibility
3877765 the master of this world who bears no evil within himself
3877766 at the heart of liberty is the right to define ones own concept of existence of meaning of the universe and of the mystery of human life

3877768 namibias first church based response to the countrys hiv aids crisis
3877769 many of the children had one or both parents who passed away and were living in incredible poverty
3877770 so much had gone wrong in their lives they were still filled with joy
3877771 instead of putting a band aid on the problem they are trying to fight it at its roots
3877772 if the needs of the mother are met by providing clean bottles and formula as well as education the virus isnt passed to the child
3877773 dont have hope for advancement so they find validation of themselves through the opposite gender
3877774 for too long wielded a dogmatic veto over any discussion of limiting abortions
3877775 not because of your position on abortion but despite it
3877776 wars of choice capital punishment hunger homelessness health care and refugees
3877777 because they think you not only defend partial birth abortion but also are against lifesaving therapy for newborns surviving an abortion attempt
3877778 can you just simply affirm your conviction that any newborn even after an abortion attempt should be given effective life sustaining treatment
3877779 you may find that the position of most american men and women is quite different from narals
3877780 with your commitment to reasoned evidence based and respectful discourse are you able to challenge your party to welcome pro life catholics into its supposed big tent
3877781 i think since 2004 weve really been talking to the democratic leadership about the importance of trying to expand the big tent of the democratic party
3877782 there will be a place for pro life democrats at the democratic convention as well
3877783 i cant see him getting up there and not talking about being pro life it just wouldnt make much sense for him to speak
3877784 casey symbolizes the pro life cause his name is associated with the issue that would be the whole point of having him speak
3877785 we need to provide more support and options for women to carry to term instead of treating abortion as only option
3877786 our role is very specific we are here to help systematically eliminate the reasons that drive women to abortion well talk to anybody who has been elected to this office to further this goal
3877787 not to have war between naral and national right to life but to listen to stories of women who felt they had no choice but abortion to hear stories of parents who struggle in the workplace and at home and at school trying to make it for themselves and their kids to listen to birth mothers of adopted children
3877788 women dont want another 35 years of this abortion is a reflection that we have not met the needs of women women have settled for less
3877789 our strong catholic faith teaches us the importance of treating all of gods children with love and respect it also teaches us that marriage between a man and a woman is the foundation of the family the first school of love peace and justice
3877790 the ruling by the california supreme court nullifying the legal definition of marriage in state law was a shock to catholics and other citizens who are concerned about how this will affect their own childrens understanding of marriage
3877791 the fight to protect marriage is an all encompassing effort that affects everyone in california
3877792 were honored to have catholics for protectmarriage com offer us their assistance and to add them to our diverse list of supporters we expect they will help us motivate a groundswell of support for proposition and were confident that with that support we will restore the definition of marriage in california come november
3877793 at other moments in our history maybe we look back and we think they were more serene but at this moment i think its very very critical for catholics to take very seriously their responsibility to be active citizens and to bring the values and the virtues of our faith into the public square and into the public debate its going to be critical in terms of how the church and other christians other believers are able to operate in this society if we are not vigilant at this moment
3877794 we cant allow ourselves to be intimidated by them and we need to exercise our rights and our freedom of speech
3877795 because those that advocate for the freedom of speech on many many fronts when it comes to the churchs voice they try to silence it
3877796 i think that they either purposely or unintentionally confuse the issues certainly a catholic in public life should not be trying to impose doctrines of belief and faith on others so what we believe about the eucharist or what we believe about the teaching authority of the bishops or the pope these are not things that we should be attempting to enshrine in law thats what is legitimately meant about separation of church and state
3877797 but i think where the confusion comes in the politicians that i think youre referring to they bring these objections up on not issues of doctrine but of moral values which also coincide with fundamental human rights
3877798 when you talk about protecting innocent human life this is something that we need to do as human beings and the fact that the church has a voice on this issue and a position on this issue doesnt mean its an imposing of our beliefs or values anymore than the effort to break down segregation by the church was an effort to impose some kind of religious doctrine on the culture or society but it was us standing up for a fundamental human right
3877799 twenty five years have passed since the promulgation of the code of canon law of 1983 and there is still much to be done in applying it knowing canon law well and faithfully applying it is essential for the church to be a mirror of justice speculum iustitiae as paul vi said
3877800 it is undeniable that we living in a new phase in the church as the beloved john paul ii said
3877801 the answer canon law gives to these new challenges is a necessary complement on the one hand it does not limit charisms but makes them more beautiful conferring upon them stability and continuity which are necessary on the other hand the legal canonical perspective allows for the rights of persons who participate in these associative realities as well as of the communities themselves to be protected
3877802 three pages of isolated and fragmentary extracts from articles dating back as far as 1994 without any context
3877803 these isolated quotes are not meaningful without the contexts of the articles themselves from which they were culled in fact most of them are even out of context from the sentences from which they were taken
3877804 because the material is not likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt based on sexual orientation
3877805 for god to enlighten our spiritual leaders governors and those who will vote in the upcoming referendum
3877806 the respect for the right of cubans exiles to come to cuba on the part of the governments of the countries where they live should not be conditioned on changes in cuba as that would be to double punishment of the same victim
3877807 but cubans themselves who live outside cuba should show solidarity with their fellow countrymen and demand all the rights for us cubans who live here
3877808 if fear has gotten to those who are overseas and they think they must pay with the price of silence if not with that of feigned complacency in order to be allowed to enter their own country as visitors then they are only contributing to the prolonging of the humiliation of all
3877809 let them look at the passport they used to leave cuba and explain why it says definitive departure
3877810 it would also eliminate the humiliating discrimination cubans suffer in our own country
3877811 we will continue here fighting for the rights of all including those of our beloved and inseparable family of cubans in the diaspora who are part of the same cuban family which is one as we are one people
3877812 we think the death penalty deters absolutely nobody from committing a crime the option of life in prison needs to be studied if it is not something that is not an infringement we could accept it
3877813 crime and violence continue to be rampant with 14 year olds murdering their peers
3877814 the death penalty is punishment upon punishment that is we would be falling into vengeance and when will it end if you kill a criminal there will be a sense of hatred and vengeance and it will be a circle that never ends
3877815 i dont think we were in any way going against the type of content we have chosen
3877816 no child should have to go though something like this they are playing with toys they shouldnt be harmed because of it
3877817 there was no way i was going to buy my children a toy again
3877818 this bill represents the most significant improvements to product safety since congress created the cpsc in the 1970s
3877819 congress responded to the wishes of parents and children all across america and passed legislation that will help restore our confidence in the safety of our toys and everyday products
3877820 god has blessed us with our son being ok and now gave me a tool to say we need to have this stopped
3877821 its not ok for lead to be in childrens toys
3877822 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
3877823 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
3877824 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
3877825 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
3877826 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
3877827 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
3877828 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
3877829 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender

3877855 we know oxidants produce free radicals that damage cells our experiments show ruthenium produces a reaction in the cell which destroys its anti oxidant defence glutathione thus destroying the cancer infected cell
3877856 working with colleagues in edinburgh university and oncosense weve proved this could be an effective line of defence against cancer
3877857 if we could just tick a box and move on it would make everyones life easier but now this really is a long term behavioural and educational campaign
3877858 we believe in a balanced approach towards any project for example a fundraiser event where the ticket costs 200 per person for dinner calls for a high quality two color gloss book as opposed to a one color offset book more suited for a high school award function
3877859 the test is uncomfortable not entirely accurate and difficult for the elderly children and people with disabilities
3877860 past the age of 60 every person has to go for this test every two years before renewing their drivers licence
3877861 people tire from it quickly and it reports false information on a large number of people who are unable to sit still in the machine
3877862 these results are the first to prospectively quantify changes in alcohol use in relation to recent combat deployments interventions should focus on at risk groups including reserve guard personnel younger individuals and those with previous or existing mental health disorders further prospective analyses using data from this study group will evaluate timing duration and co existing illnesses of alcohol misuse and other alcohol related problems better defining the long term effect of military combat deployments on these important health outcomes
3877863 what this study shows is that doctors should be doing regular monitoring of these children over time because a one time checkup might not be enough to tell if they are at risk for developing diabetes
3877864 to better treat at risk children we need better ways to monitor beta cell function and visceral fat buildup
3877865 those are tough to measure but are probably the main factors determining who will get type 2 diabetes
3877866 the study provides great insight into the risk factors that lead to the progression towards type 2 diabetes in this population
3877867 only by understanding how this devastating disease develops will be able to begin taking steps to prevent it
3877868 just having a green roof may not mean anything in terms of preventing water from reaching the street level for instance
3877869 green roofs have to be done right and our hope is to help manufacturers understand how to improve their designs
3877870 thats a huge difference to have a 20 or so degree temperature drop
3877871 after you choose a manufacturer tell them what kind of plants and what other features you want
3877872 its up to them to then tailor the green roof to your needs

3877875 contrary to our predictions based on shorter follow up the absolute difference in cumulative incidence of distant metastasis and prostate cancer death did not further increase after 7 years of follow up
3877876 in settings with a large proportion of psa detected tumors the relative reduction in risk of death following radical prostatectomy might be somewhat larger or similar to that in our study but the absolute reduction would be smaller
3877877 these results demonstrate that among men younger than 65 years whose prostate cancer is detected by methods other than psa testing eg due to a digital rectal examination to evaluate uri nary or other symptoms cure with radical prostatectomy is possi ble may be necessary and should generally be recommended
3877878 the global models are good for investigating whats likely to happen on a planetary scale but the resolution is quite coarse when looking at a more localised regional scale
3877879 its a bit like enlarging a digital photograph until it becomes pixellated and all sorts of detail is blurred out
3877880 simulating the climate of the region is a challenge for climate models due in part to the high natural inter annual variability the topography of the region which includes multiple mountain ranges and inland seas and the presence of a slight cooling trend in recent decades despite the global trend being a warming
3877881 we need to confirm this result with other models but a 50 per cent increase in rainfall in such an important agricultural area is a much more hopeful scenario than a 15 per cent decline

3877912 the meeting was set up in order to share information back and forth between us it was not set up as a meeting to come to any final decision
3877913 we certainly implied to wiseman and he agreed that this had to be a high level meeting
3877914 we have to have people present who have the authority to make some very definite decisions

3877917 they have to have a plan in place and the physicians have had offers
3877918 there have been numerous approaches to prevent youth violence none of them before boston contemplated simply telling hard core offenders to knock it off
3877919 none of this is easy it takes focus and coordination which is never in excess supply it takes close working relationships between different and often traditionally opposed enforcement service and community groups it takes sustaining of a very unusual relationship between the authorities and offenders
3877920 if you really want to hurt your parents and you dont have the nerve to be a homosexual the least you can do is go into the arts but do not use semicolons they are transvestite hermaphrodites standing for absolutely nothing all they do is show youve been to college

3877953 the audit wont be released until tomorrow and no one is saying what that audit is going to show however it is known that last year a union township resident named alex lambros filed a series of documents with the auditors office along with a complaint alleging financial improprieties here in union township
3877954 they knew that doug walker had no experience whatsoever as a township administrator yet they gave him a contract that puts him at the highest level pay probably of any administrator in the state of ohio
3877955 a proposal to allow medicare to use its bargaining power to negotiate prescription drug prices with manufacturers
3877956 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
3877957 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
3877958 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
3877959 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
3877960 this is one of many ways well be encouraging our supporters to skip the lines on election day and make sure their vote is cast early
3877961 instructions are being developed and being sent to boards of election across the state to make sure voting is consistent
3877962 there is no question that the huge effort to register and turn out voters at ohio state university is going to have a positive impact on our race
3877963 the army and security forces will not yield to attempts to terrorise them with attacks and crimes
3877964 the investigation has begun and there are many interpretations political interpretations

3877975 theres just no doubt that in terms of longer term infrastructure theres more out there on the right than there is on the left
3877976 this book is nothing but a series of lies that were long ago discredited written by an individual who was discredited after he wrote a similar book to help george bush and dick cheney get re elected four years ago
3877977 the reality is that there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off of a presidential campaign

3877980 there is a natural tendency for most people to do some mental imaging some will see only pictures others will see pictures hear sounds feel movements of the body some people will actually move through the skills
3877981 make that picture of yourself running and see what you would like to change
3877982 then float back into the body and make the correction and then float out of your body and see if you made the correction
3877983 then go out to compete and play and forget about it the fastest way to mess something up is to think about it in detail while you are doing it

3877988 there is the possibility that the demographics of the all volunteer force draw more rape prone men into uniform as compared to civil society
3877989 there are some issues that need to be discussed and talked about but it shouldnt happen in public because it harms workers and our strategy to organize these issues could easily have been discussed and were being discussed internally
3877990 it crippled us by restricting our ability to think outside the narrow parameters of wages hours and working conditions and isolating those whod fought hardest for issues like peace and civil rights
3877991 i believe that there must always be room within organized labor for legitimate and principled dissent
3877992 the public discourse initiated by uhw and sal rosselli may well be kicking up a lot of dust but it has also provoked a closer examination of the direction of our movement
3877993 were just getting to some of the debates we have to have
3877994 one national union deals with one set of employers bargaining one contract
3877995 including unions uhw has every right to raise and put on the table especially in a convention year significant differences with the unions leadership
3877996 hospitals and acute care facilities are moving more elderly and other patients to nursing homes and other off site facilities more quickly
3877997 next they move them home for home based care but it is the same patient we think they should get the same quality care whether they are in the acute care facility in a nursing home or at home we want to build solidarity between all the workers who provide health care we dont want acute care workers to say they are better than nursing home providers and at home providers pulling nursing home and home care workers wages and conditions up to the level of hospital workers will be hard but will build worker solidarity we dont want a shortcut that adds more members but which hurts worker solidarity
3877998 that helped us move to los angeles and leverage a newly forming union and establish standards there
3877999 we use our membership as a fighting force to march picket demonstrate and put pressure on non union buildings you need to establish a base in an industry so you can move out from there
3878000 you have to pull back the teeth of the employers before workers have a fair chance to organize the union
3878001 neutrality and card check agreements are common in exchange the employer is going to want to understand how much its going to cost them thats common in our industry its just a fact of life
3878002 while we all agree we want to organize industries and industry master agreements we also have workers under contract who expect to see tangible results from unionization and a betterment of their lives how far can we go in sacrificing their immediate needs and involvement to the greater end of building density
3878003 we have always had relations with employers but we have approached even cooperation from the standpoint of strength we cant surrender traditional rights like the right to picket strike or bargain
3878004 organizing is organizing whether we can do it from the bottom up or with neutrality i have seen unionizing change workers lives and if we can get neutrality we should take it and bargain a contract seiu including uhw has good contracts because it has industry strength
3878005 bargaining for organizing rights depends on how well educated our members are about the necessity of making some sacrifices in economics to gain that bargaining goal our union has delivered for its members and has a certain rank and file tradition thats still alive people believe they get what they have because theyre in the union but that doesnt translate automatically into a broader social vision or organizing impetus unless youre doing constant education and have a politically conscious leadership you cant win their support
3878006 while its sometimes flawed and needs to be improved seiu national strategy has organized workers in geographic areas where they would never have had a chance to organize otherwise arizona for instance is very important to us because its a red state where seiu wants to build political power
3878007 you stretch them as far as you can and at the same time youre aggressively and militantly organizing the workers leading them in strikes and building power
3878008 power is being much more concentrated at the top with centralized decision making
3878009 in the california nursing home industry seiu started making top down deals without local or rank and file participation its all centered around a drive for growth at all costs without taking into account standards that need to be raised at the same time pre negotiating contracts with corporations to get organizing rights while limiting the collective bargaining rights of workers who are being organized into the union
3878010 rank and file members elect the bargaining committee members go out to buildings and get nominating petitions signed
3878011 in 1996 when andy stern was elected we were part of that team
3878012 we amended the constitution to obligate local unions with a culture of total autonomy in which they often undermined each other to coordinate with other locals instead that represented workers with common employers to collaborate in organizing and collective bargaining we set up a democratic process called unity councils to force that collaboration in the last few months the international dissolved the unity council at catholic healthcare west just as we were going into bargaining to try to assume total control from washington d c thats the fundamental problem were now having
3878013 samuel gompers confused the needs of labor as an institution with the needs of the working class
3878014 cutting deals so you can grow your own institution makes politics into a kind of insider baseball
3878015 theres significantly less room for canada to follow its own strategy
3878016 we already differ with the americans on certain matters such as how to deal with opium production this will give us no room at all to differ from washington

3878060 one should not expect the regulator to change the policies too frequently we do not expect the market to react to this tomorrow
3878061 it is certainly an efficient process and the issues which were held over due to regulatory issues would now see the light of day

3878066 the rupee opened weaker following the stock market losses everywhere and then the local stocks also stayed negative so the rupee continued to be under pressure through the day
3878067 the board decided that in this kind of volatile market the price uncertainty is so much that it will not be practical to have a six month average and issuers will be allowed to make them on the basis of the last two weeks average price the practice in some other markets is to allow the price on the day on which the issue is made we havent gone to that degree of proximity but want to move closer to global practices
3878068 one of the things corporates have been saying was that the rights issue process takes a long time the board had given us a mandate in the march meeting to examine whether the efficiency in the primary market can improve on similar lines as that of the secondary market rights issues can now be completed in 43 days instead of 109 days earlier this will reduce risks for the investor because the price is determined way back and the issue process takes its own time it will also reduce risks for corporates
3878069 we will now see whether the process itself can be changed in a manner that it can be done faster

3878079 one of the more depressing aspects of blogging and the modern world is seeing reams of text on a page the thunder dragons mixture of politics and fun posts with good illustrations and quickly made points makes his blog an accessible and fun place to discuss and think about politics the thunderdragon is one of the rising stars of conservative blogging
3878080 already an a lister technical whiz thunder dragon shows that not all a listers are stuck up stats groupies whod sell their grandmothers for more traffic and hes on iain dales list for a reason hes simply a fine blogger scoring highly on the ten point dale criteria and with his finger always on the political pulse hes also the technical brains behind blogpower along with ian at imagined community
3878081 the thunderdragon consistently provides an interesting and enjoyable read always entertaining and often insightful his writing may even give us a foretaste of our political future stick with him after all time will cure his youth
3878082 this is a parting gift from the bush administration to its timber friends
3878083 it flies in the face of the science that says we need to protect more habitat not less
3878084 after almost 20 years of relying on a static regulatory approach which has led to continual inaction and further decline of the owl it is clear we should be using active management to improve the health of our forests and the spotted owl
3878085 unfortunately this designation doubles down on a patently absurd approach
3878086 but you shall utterly destroy them the hittite and the amorite the canaanite as the lord your god has commanded you

3878088 i wish i had asked for my day in court rather than accepted a police caution
3878089 that way i could have explained that i was trying to do what was right for my daughter
3878090 jess isnt bad but some of the 13 year olds who live here do use drugs and drink and i dont want that path for her
3878091 when an offence is admitted the offender is always liable to receive a caution
3878092 had the offence not been admitted officers would have pursued the matter with the cps
3878093 an allegation of domestic violence was made and gmp officers always take these allegations very seriously
3878094 i did deserve the slapping because of the things id been doing
3878095 i was expecting my dad to come home from the police station and for everything to be the same as before
3878096 all parents can sometimes be pushed to the limit by teenagers who are looking to see how far they can go but smacking wont solve the problem
3878097 it simply tells your child that violence is acceptable and gives the message that its all right for them to hit other people

3878109 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
3878110 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
3878111 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
3878112 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
3878113 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
3878114 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
3878115 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
3878116 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
3878117 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
3878118 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
3878119 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
3878120 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
3878121 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
3878122 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
3878123 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
3878124 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
3878125 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
3878126 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
3878127 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
3878128 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
3878129 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
3878130 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
3878131 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
3878132 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
3878133 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
3878134 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
3878135 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
3878136 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
3878137 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
3878138 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
3878139 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
3878140 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country

3878145 we have increased productivity at the wolverine operation while brule continues to meet all expectations at its higher operating rates once past this phase of waste rock removal at wolverine well see coal production increase and we are confident that we will meet our production and cost goals for the year
3878146 the second quarter is expected to be stronger as we achieve the full benefit of the current high coal price for all of our production expect an improvement in the ratio of clean coal produced to waste removed and lower our mining costs

3878151 rapidly rising health care costs are not simply a federal budget problem
3878152 growth in health related spending is the primary driver of the fiscal challenges facing state and local governments as well unsustainable growth in health care spending also threatens to erode the ability of employers to provide coverage to their workers and undercuts their ability to compete in a global marketplace
3878153 its going to slowly pick up and i think it is picking up now

3878157 theres a softer side to my character in this episode
3878158 as our show does and has done in the past you catch glimpses of time that may or may not actually come to fruition but are possibilities episode nineteen of season one was called five years gone and that whole episode was based on that premise this episode has elements of that and my character is involved in those elements
3878159 there is a little bit of painting that happens in this scene as well
3878160 because i am put in a position to prove something to myself in this scene and i employ my old stand by paint the future power in order to do that

3878164 right now im doing episodes two four eight and nine
3878165 i think that the time we had away from the show really made all of us that much more grateful to come back and that much more excited
3878166 its been so long since weve been on the air all of us are just really a hundred percent committed to what were making this year the response that we got at comic con was so exciting and so enthusiastic that were really excited to carry that into the rest of the season with us

3878192 deploying femtocells requires a good understanding of market segmentation of both mobile consumer and household markets meticulous planning and targeted marketing campaigns which mean operators will have to invest substantial amount of money if they want femtocell services to gain popularity
3878193 if femtocells are sold to customers in sporadic fashion via traditional mobile operators channels then this may induce a huge scattering of femtocell deployment over large areas not only will this make it hard to manage faps femtocell access points and related networks but most importantly this would mean the operator will not be able to make any capex capital expenditure or opex operational expenditure savings
3878194 if and when it changes we will have a wholesale business and our association with tata will give us great experience in india
3878195 we view this as a sensible deal for tesco with a strong partner in tata which has existing retail capability and strong local knowledge of the indian market whilst it will enable tesco to begin the development infrastructure and supply chain which is one of the current constraints of the indian market to modern retail practices

3878201 the presidency thinks right now its better to focus on problem solving rather than trying to go into characterisation of the war who started what who reacted and the eu is united behind the idea
3878202 the presidency wants to preserve as much room for manoeuvre for future mediation as possible
3878203 the situation is still evolving its not black and white of course georgia made some mistakes russia made some mistakes but the idea now is to help mediation to see what we can do from a humanitarian point of view
3878204 the eu should say no to russias subjugation of georgia and push russia out this means tough language sanctions against russia and quick eu humanitarian intervention
3878205 the first lesson of this crisis is that the old policy of eu non engagement has encouraged both parties to escalate their actions from an eu perspective the first casualty is the theory that by getting more involved in georgia the eu will irritate russia and provoke instability

3878217 this study should be enlightening and practice changing for doctors and patients alike
3878218 its a tricky business and it requires a lot of close followup

3878220 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion

3878231 the national assembly of pakistan expresses its deep condolences over the shahadat of sheikh abdul aziz and several other kashmiris by the indian security forces
3878232 we condemn the excessive and brutal use of force by the indian security forces against the innocent civilian population of indian occupied kashmir and valley
3878233 an end to unwarranted use of force and gross human rights violations against the innocent kashmiris
3878234 political moral and diplomatic support of the people and the government of pakistan to the kashmiri people in their struggle to achieve their rights including the right to self determination
3878235 early just durable and peaceful settlement of jammu and kashmir dispute in accordance with relevant u n resolutions and aspirations of kashmiri people
3878236 use their good offices to urge india to stop the atrocities against unarmed civilian kashmiris
3878237 such remarks are factually wrong and bear no relationship to reality
3878238 to call for international involvement in the sovereign internal affairs of india is gratuitous illegal and only reflects reversion to a mindset that has led to no good consequences for pakistan in the past
3878239 i slammed the brakes on spotting the big cat it was just 15 metres away on the 15 foot wide mud road we were driving on
3878240 though i intended to reverse the car i was so shaken that i ended up driving ahead while the panicky srinivas screamed his lungs out for help
3878241 the delimitation exercise requires a resolution to be passed in each state assembly this was not done in jammu and kashmir
3878242 the bjp was in alliance with the nc only at the centre not in the state

3878260 its not just about how you dispose of products and packaging anymore
3878261 its about being conscious about products you buy in the first place thats the idea behind precycling
3878262 it is bound to be the case there will be a quarter or two of negative growth
3878263 the committees forecasts for gdp growth now envisage the economy broadly stagnating over the next year or so
3878264 however there is a clear chance that the economy slows even more sharply than this business surveys are already warning of the danger that the economy actually contracts in the second half of the year
3878265 the british economy is going through a difficult and painful adjustment to higher energy and commodity prices and in banking credit and housing markets
3878266 this adjustment to our economy cannot be avoided and as a result inflation is rising and growth is slowing
3878267 while we would not rule out a cut in british rates in november particularly if the economy slows markedly further and oil prices continue to retreat we are maintaining our view that interest rates will stay at 5 00 per cent until early 2009
3878268 however we then expect interest rates to come down markedly in 2009 to 4 25 per cent by mid 2009 and to 3 75 per cent by the fourth quarter of next year
3878269 minor clipping issue if you stand at point x and view on an axis of 175 degrees issue
3878270 this game will also afford me a chance to see the players in a game situation as i have only just come into the team and need to understand how each player responds
3878271 im personally very happy and i hope ive made the chelsea fans happy ive had seven great seasons here and now i can have many more
3878272 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of the frustrating things a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
3878273 my world got turned upside down and i dont think it is anything anyone appreciates until you go through it
3878274 i feel for sure ive made 100 percent the right decision for myself for my family and for chelsea football club
3878275 this has always been a very important contract for me ive just turned 30 and i see it as my final big contract to see my playing days out at chelsea
3878276 i am delighted that frank has committed his future to the club
3878277 he is a key player for me and vital to chelseas future successes
3878278 frank is one of the best professionals i have worked with everyday he tries to learn something and bring new elements to his game
3878279 these are big issues for the club for frank and any other player
3878280 whatever has gone on i think there is that underlying desire that we get there its taken both frank and the club longer than we originally thought
3878281 it allows us to kill all the speculation of the last 18 months and allows us to concentrate on the really important thing next season
3878282 location is an extra thing that can transform every site on the web
3878283 were concentrating right now on making it as big as possible and getting the service used
3878284 the two presidents decided to establish diplomatic relations at the level of ambassadors in line with the treaty of the united nations and international law

3878286 assad has instructed all concerned syrian officials that he wants this visit to be successful and fruitful

3878525 strategia pentru urmatoarea perioada vizeaza doua componente in primul rand vom urmari consolidarea mecanismelor optimizarea acestora atragerea de noi participanti castigarea increderii opiniei publice in al doilea rand trebuiesc identificate cai de crestere institutionala pe baza unor mecanisme pur bursiere precum lansarea de noi produse sau colaborarea cu alte institutii din afara

3878530 in primele sapte luni ale acestui an piata auto a inregistrat o scadere de 1 in conditiile in care cota de piata a importurilor s a apreciat la 68 pe fondul opririi productiei uzinei de la craiova
3878531 datorita anuntului intrarii in vigoare a noii taxe de poluare multi dintre cei care doreau sa si cumpere un autoturism second hand din import au asteptat luna iulie pentru a importa masina astfel se poate explica diferenta dintre lunile mai iunie si iulie
3878532 ministerul finantelor urmeaza sa reglementeze plata tva ului la automobilele second hand din import care pana acum au fost tratate cu pasivitate tva ul acestor masini ar trebui adus la bugetul de stat
3878533 1 889 de autoturisme noi si 7 785 de modele second hand
3878534 rusia a facut o demonstratie de forta in caucaz dar romania desi este prietena georgiei nu avea cum sa reactioneze altfel in aceasta situatie nu se poate vorbi acum de avantaje pentru romania
3878535 pe termen scurt data fiind calitatea noastra de membru al nato dincolo de faptul ca suntem prietenii georgiei trebuie sa ne controlam tonul s a dat impresia ca georgia a fost abandonata de prietenii ei dar cel putin in aceasta perioada este important ca fermitatea sa prevaleze
3878536 pentru romania evolutiile din regiunea marii negre sunt de interes prioritar iar riscurile generate de conflicte precum cel din georgia sunt considerabile si pot avea consecinte dramatice asupra vecinatatii noastre din aceasta perspectiva sustinem ca implicarea sporita a ue in rezolvarea acestor conflicte este absolut necesara
3878537 romania ar trebui sa beneficieze de apartenenta la ue pentru cei mai multi investitori statutul romaniei de tara membra a ue este o cvasi garantie de siguranta si stabilitate de aceea orice plan de investitii care include romania ar trebui sa nu fie alterat

3878539 autoritatile de la moscova se vor folosi de aceasta sansa atacul asupra georgiei sa aminteasca ucrainei care sunt dezavantajele unei aliante a kievului cu nato
3878540 georgia va fi de acum inainte mult mai atenta si mai putin increzatoare in relatia sa cu statele unite ale americii
3878541 rusia ar putea gasi de cuviinta acum sa ridice tensiunea in relatiile cu ucraina in perspectiva revizuirii de catre nato a deciziei de acordare a map ului georgiei si ucrainei din luna decembrie daca disputa cu rusia va afecta integrarea georgiei in nato o soarta asemanatoare ar putea avea si ucraina
3878542 operatiunile militare din georgia reprezinta o amenintare la adresa ucrainei ca ar trebui sa renunte la cererile de aderare la nato altfel moscova ar putea interveni pentru a proteja interesele amenintate ale populatiei rusesti

3878565 influentelele crizei generale se suprapun unui grad din ce in ce mai mare de indatorare a populatiei la banci ceea ce duce in mod firesc la o scadere a cererii cu toate acestea piata din romania este in plina dezvoltare fiind impulsionata de numarul mare de centre comerciale si parcuri de retail in curs de deschidere sau prognozate in urmatorii doi trei ani

3878578 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew

3878584 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
3878585 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
3878586 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
3878587 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
3878588 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art

3878590 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
3878591 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
3878592 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
3878593 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing

3878597 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
3878598 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
3878599 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
3878600 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
3878601 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done

3878607 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
3878608 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30

3878612 as members of the public listened to a complex policy discussion on charter schools nevada board of education member greg nance dangled a piece of jewelry in the face of his newlywed wife ringing a tiny bell on a bracelet as she giggled
3878613 the distraction caused fellow board member cindy reid to call for an immediate halt to saturdays video conference of the state board of education all members but reid and nance were meeting in carson city
3878614 im embarrassed the public has to watch this this is so inappropriate
3878615 bill irvin a deputy attorney general who advises the board urged nance to follow decorum
3878616 i will tell you i love my wife but shes not sitting next to me

3878620 its times like this that i cant believe these people have sos and im still single
3878621 this research is especially important because it opens new avenues for exploration of autoimmune disease that embrace the concepts of protein complementarity
3878622 the power of this approach has gone unappreciated even though the basic ideas of protein complementarity have been proven in other settings over the years
3878623 using an antibody reactive with complementary pr3 protein produced in the laboratory we analyzed protein pools removed from the patients plasma during plasma exchange therapy to identify any existing proteins that were reactive with the anti complementary pr3 antibody
3878624 identification of potentially pathogenic disease causing anti plasminogen antibodies provides an explanation of why patients with pr3 anca disease have a high incidence of blood clots
3878625 what is needed is a clinical test that is specific and precise enough to measure anti plasminogen antibody levels
3878626 hopefully our discoveries will entice scientists to consider the potential implications of protein complementarity
3878627 antibodies with dual reactivity to plasminogen and complementary pr3 in pr3 anca vasculitis
3878628 animal studies have indicated for years that msg might be associated with weight gain

3878631 we saw this risk even when we controlled for physical activity total calorie intake and other possible explanations for the difference in body mass the positive associations between msg intake and overweight were consistent with data from animal studies
3878632 the u s food and drug administration and other health organizations around the world have concluded that msg is safe
3878633 the poor who sell their organs are being exploited whether by richer people within their own countries or by transplant tourists from abroad

3878653 when my mother remarried it was to an indonesian with an equally skeptical bent a man who saw religion as not particularly useful in the practical business of making ones way in the world and who had grown up in a country that easily blended its islamic faith with remnants of hinduism buddhism and ancient animist traditions
3878654 like many indonesians lolo followed a brand of islam that could make room for the remnants of more ancient animist and hindu faiths
3878655 obamas campaign aides have emphasized his strong christian beliefs and downplayed any islamic connection the illinois senator was raised in a secular household in indonesia by his stepfather and mother his chief spokesman robert gibbs said in a statement in january after false reports began circulating that obama had attended a radical madrasa or koranic school as a child to be clear senator obama has never been a muslim was not raised a muslim and is a committed christian who attends the united church of christ in chicago gibbs jan 24 statement said

3878704 rusia a facut o demonstratie de forta in caucaz dar romania desi este prietena georgiei nu avea cum sa reactioneze altfel in aceasta situatie nu se poate vorbi acum de avantaje pentru romania
3878705 pe termen scurt data fiind calitatea noastra de membru al nato dincolo de faptul ca suntem prietenii georgiei trebuie sa ne controlam tonul s a dat impresia ca georgia a fost abandonata de prietenii ei dar cel putin in aceasta perioada este important ca fermitatea sa prevaleze
3878706 pentru romania evolutiile din regiunea marii negre sunt de interes prioritar iar riscurile generate de conflicte precum cel din georgia sunt considerabile si pot avea consecinte dramatice asupra vecinatatii noastre din aceasta perspectiva sustinem ca implicarea sporita a ue in rezolvarea acestor conflicte este absolut necesara
3878707 romania ar trebui sa beneficieze de apartenenta la ue pentru cei mai multi investitori statutul romaniei de tara membra a ue este o cvasi garantie de siguranta si stabilitate de aceea orice plan de investitii care include romania ar trebui sa nu fie alterat

3878712 operatiunile militare din georgia reprezinta o amenintare la adresa ucrainei ca ar trebui sa renunte la cererile de aderare la nato altfel moscova ar putea interveni pentru a proteja interesele amenintate ale populatiei rusesti

3878720 she came into my life unexspectedly just as she has left me this precious little angel from above gave me strength and unconditional love now she is gone and i dont know why all i am guilty of is loving her and providing her a safe home jealousy has taken her away jealousy from the one person that should be thankfull for all of the love and support given to her a mothers love is deep however there are limits when one is betrayed by the one she loved and trusted the most a daughter comes to her mother for support when she is pregnant the mother says without hesitation it will be ok and it was but then the lies and betrayal began first it seemed harmless ah love is blind a mother will look for the good in her child and give them a chance to change this mother gave chance after chance for her daughter to change but instead more lies more betrayal what does the mother get for giving her daughter all of these chances a broken heart the daughter who stole money lots of money leaves without warning and does not let her mother now speak to the baby that her mother raised fed clothed sheltered paid her medical bills etc instead tells her friends that her mother is controlling her life and she needs her space no money no future where did she go who is now watching out for the little angel

3878737 theres almost no chance whatsoever well do a superbad sequel with the boys and everything because thats where their story ends and also the fear with kind of doing these kind of gross out movies is like where can you go from there
3878738 theyve been wanting us to do a sequel to superbad for so long but weve held off we eventually said no but this one its not a precious coming of age story like superbad its a weed action movie and if it did well and they gave us like 50 million dollars as opposed to the 26m we got for this one we could benefit from that
3878739 even before superbad came out i think the studio was trying to get seth rogen and evan goldberg to write a sequel but they really didnt want to write a sequel i guess the kids would go to college or something like that that was the studios idea
3878740 and so an answer to that was to do a superbad pineapple express crossover an unprecedented crossover movie with two directors greg motolla and david gordon green each directing half of the movie and somehow these characters get together which doesnt make sense at all but could work
3878741 i could sell them the characters from superbad something but i think wed want some action so you know somehow the kids get in trouble somehow and we have to get them out of it
3878742 and seth plays characters in both movies so somehow wed have to kill one of them off

3878753 we dont know how tibolone reduces breast cancer risk understanding its mechanism might point us toward new ways to prevent the disease
3878754 stroke is very rare among women under age 60 so although taking tibolone does slightly increase the risk for women in their 50s the benefits of treatment for bothersome menopausal symptoms would outweigh those risks

3878807 starting to realize that the stress in the credit market will persist for some time
3878808 the mortgage finance system in the united states has been badly damaged
3878809 there is definitely some reinvention that will need to occur and that will include some explicit involvement by the government
3878810 the bond vigilantes took law and order in their own hands and pushed yields up which would slow down the economy and bring down inflation
3878811 this time the bond credit vigilantes are refusing to go into the saloon and start drinking what wall streets financial engineers are mixing
3878812 it appears that every time we peel away this onion there is another layer
3878813 to the extent that home prices keep spiraling down the need for capital keeps increasing
3878814 it may be a step in the right direction but i am not sure it will solve all the problems
3878815 across the whole financial sector from the individual mortgage all the way up to private equity the system was lending on momentum in asset prices and not on the borrowers ability to repay

3878824 theres just such a small window that i wouldnt say its likely but there is definitely a chance
3878825 you have to talk to people and educate people to expand the possibilities in this field
3878826 you need to go into larger trials for safety and efficacy insmeds limited data appeared to be good data however bioequivalence testing in healthy volunteers does not provide the necessary data on how the biologic actually works in the body which can only be determined through more extensive clinical testing in patients where safety and efficacy are evaluated
3878827 these types of drugs make an enormous amount of money
3878828 if generics come into the marketplace itll eradicate the monopoly lets be clear this is all about protecting monopoly
3878829 we just want to make sure patient safety and data protection for innovators will be a part of the bill
3878830 the biologics industry even now is largely made up of small companies that are losing money
3878831 insmed is real you want to say yes to these people or no to these people
3878832 if we dont well be buying european or asian products when we could be buying american products produced by americans
3878833 the bottom line is that its a good business model
3878834 some of us didnt feel comfortable doing it just because to me it was a little clownish for our part to be doing that
3878835 but the sponsors insisted and insisted i think it is just a bad idea i guess to do that but it was never intended to be offensive or racist against anybody
3878836 i didnt find it very funny i didnt find it offensive either i guess some guys didnt mind to me i dont want to be that way i guess to be doing that stuff
3878837 if anybody feels offended by it we totally apologize for it we never meant anything offensive by it
3878838 we did it because we thought it was going to be something nice something with no problem
3878839 but somebody wants to talk about it it is too much of a big deal with you guys the media and everybody talking about that
3878840 as other events build momentum and the track and field competition begins it will be interesting to follow the fan favorites online
3878841 the money was going to fringe arts groups that in many cases would be at best unrepresentative and at worst offensive
3878842 i guess more than anything its a little bit annoying that weve been made the scapegoat when you consider how much money we receive relative to the budget for the entire program
3878843 so all of these other larger groups who need money more than we do to travel abroad like ballet and symphonies we become the scapegoat for the cutting in their funding
3878844 a lot of times people are doing things that are valuable and meaningful but not necessarily commercially viable
3878845 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3878846 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3878847 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3878848 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3878849 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3878850 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3878851 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3878852 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3878853 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3878854 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3878855 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3878856 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3878857 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3878858 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3878859 we can make more money in mobile than we do in the desktop eventually and the reason is the mobile computer is more targeted think about it you carry your phone and your phone knows all about you we can do a very very targeted ad

3878901 the disruption of the btc pipeline would undoubtedly offer a nice bonus to russia by diverting azerbaijani oil exports along russian routes but the scale of the gain is not worth all the human and reputation losses the russian government has committed itself to in the operation in georgia
3878902 according to many there are many untapped hydrocarbon resources in the caspian sea bordering azerbaijan
3878903 to others the resources of the region are not enough to undertake major export projects such as the nabucco gas pipeline from the caspian across the caucasus and turkey to central europe and italy
3878904 the war in georgia may confirm the existing doubts about the reliability of georgia as a transit country
3878905 this may lead not only to political reluctance towards the nabucco project but also to decreasing investors confidence
3878906 it is too early to tell in what extent the war in georgia will affect the overall price of oil
3878907 oil prices may be affected only on a temporary basis leaving the major responsibility of determining the new level of oil prices to other trends and factors like the recent decrease in us energy demand and the recent increase in oil production in saudi arabia
3878908 it is important to keep in mind that the war in georgia will be nothing more than just one factor among many which will determine the future level of oil prices both on the demand and the supply side

3878931 aligning himself systematically with the american positions that are often partisan and irresponsible that is the indispensable condition for france and through her the european union to be able to play a useful role that will serve to bring about as rapidly as possible a return to peace in this strategic region of the world france should especially take into account the fact that the georgian authorities took on themselves a heavy responsibility for having triggered a bloody conflict by launching a particularly murderous offensive against the capital of south ossetia which aspires to join the russian federation alongside north ossetia

3878933 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3878934 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3878935 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3878936 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3878937 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3878938 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3878939 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3878940 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3878941 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3878942 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3878943 it is higher than the last couple of months but by no means unprecedented february this year also saw six critical and five important updates
3878944 there are 500 plus vulnerabilities reported every month not all of these are windows related of course many of these are related to less prevalent systems but microsoft products still account for a large number of these vulnerabilities
3878945 only critical and important vulnerabilities were addressed in this update i am sure there were less severe vulnerabilities reported or found but it seems that microsoft has had to focus on only the most severe triage style it is important to patch these first however i should point out that most attacks are based on a combination of less dangerous vulnerabilities
3878946 critical patches address issues that can lead to malicious code being run directly on the victims computer the most serious form of attack
3878947 enterprises should apply the patches as soon as possible particularly the internet explorer patch because it addresses a vulnerability that has been publicly disclosed and affects the software that is most likely to encounter malicious attacks internet browsing is by far the most effective common way in which the average use will encounter malicious code
3878948 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3878949 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3878950 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3878951 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3878952 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3878953 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3878954 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3878955 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3878956 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3878957 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3878958 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3878959 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3878960 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3878961 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3878962 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3878963 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3878964 who are open to doing something on the production side
3878965 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3878966 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3878967 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3878968 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3878969 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3878970 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3878971 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country

3878974 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3878975 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3878976 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3878977 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3878978 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3878979 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3878980 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3878981 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3878982 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3878983 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3878984 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3878985 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3878986 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3878987 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3878988 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3878989 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3878990 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3878991 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3878992 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3878993 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3878994 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3878995 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3878996 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3878997 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3878998 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3878999 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3879000 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3879001 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3879002 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3879003 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3879004 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3879005 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3879006 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3879007 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3879008 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3879009 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3879010 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3879011 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3879012 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3879013 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3879014 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3879015 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3879016 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3879017 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3879018 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3879019 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3879020 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3879021 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3879022 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3879023 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3879024 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3879025 greetings i just published a new movie to my mobileme gallery that id like to share with you click the link below to check it out
3879026 dammit vladimir im prepared to do this all day your troops will not make it to atlanta
3879027 the reduction in breast cancer risk was a surprise to us
3879028 we dont know how tibolone reduces breast cancer risk understanding its mechanism might point us toward new ways to prevent the disease
3879029 stroke is very rare among women under age 60 so although taking tibolone does slightly increase the risk for women in their 50s the benefits of treatment for bothersome menopausal symptoms would outweigh those risks
3879030 this research is especially important because it opens new avenues for exploration of autoimmune disease that embrace the concepts of protein complementarity
3879031 the power of this approach has gone unappreciated even though the basic ideas of protein complementarity have been proven in other settings over the years
3879032 using an antibody reactive with complementary pr3 protein produced in the laboratory we analyzed protein pools removed from the patients plasma during plasma exchange therapy to identify any existing proteins that were reactive with the anti complementary pr3 antibody
3879033 identification of potentially pathogenic disease causing anti plasminogen antibodies provides an explanation of why patients with pr3 anca disease have a high incidence of blood clots
3879034 what is needed is a clinical test that is specific and precise enough to measure anti plasminogen antibody levels
3879035 hopefully our discoveries will entice scientists to consider the potential implications of protein complementarity
3879036 antibodies with dual reactivity to plasminogen and complementary pr3 in pr3 anca vasculitis
3879037 the poor who sell their organs are being exploited whether by richer people within their own countries or by transplant tourists from abroad
3879038 the legacy of transplantation must not be the impoverished victims of organ trafficking and transplant tourism but rather a celebration of the gift of health by one individual to another
3879039 the declaration of istanbul on organ trafficking and transplant tourism
3879040 bombardier selected global aviation to provide aog and line maintenance support to bombardier business aircraft in the region
3879041 we appreciate the enthusiasm of our developers and were excited that youre so passionate about the android platform thanks for taking the time to send this
3879042 sounds like a polite way of saying nothing a verbal silence
3879043 the lesson here for washington is that any modern conflict will include a cyberwarfare component simply because its too inexpensive to be passed up
3879044 the best defensive strategy is always preparedness weve spent eight years completely ignoring that while the chinese and indian governments have been paying really close attention and investing many tens of billions of dollars
3879045 the first time a known cyberattack had coincided with a shooting war
3879046 prominent in my growing up and ive always liked the aesthetic of
3879047 these ladies are some of the best milfs youll find anywhere
3879048 i loved shooting them and getting them in the mood wasnt hard at all theres nothing like watching a woman peel her clothes off then groping her and feeling that naked flesh aline was a very dirty girl and the guys at home are really going to enjoy how she gets into it during her anal scene and how she isnt afraid to show how filthy she can be
3879049 this is a movie that brings it all together with the right women and the right locations
3879050 i have had a great time working with pleasure productions and especially matt zane
3879051 without my fans i would have never had the career that i have had they have always been behind me
3879052 we loved working with tera on some incredible movies like tera wray is the runaway brat the orifice strap on sally 23 radium 1 and 2 and more
3879053 her professionalism on set was always appreciated and performers loved working with her guys and girls her southern girl sweetness made her such a big star and her fans sure will miss seeing new titles of course we wish she could be with pleasure productions forever but we wish her all the best with her new life with wayne
3879054 animal studies have indicated for years that msg might be associated with weight gain
3879055 ours is the first study to show a link between msg use and weight in humans
3879056 we found that prevalence of overweight was significantly higher in msg users than in non users
3879057 we saw this risk even when we controlled for physical activity total calorie intake and other possible explanations for the difference in body mass the positive associations between msg intake and overweight were consistent with data from animal studies
3879058 the u s food and drug administration and other health organizations around the world have concluded that msg is safe
3879059 the hardest thing for me is when you come on the set and its all gone its all taken down
3879060 man i love the show i never gave it a chance i dont like sci fi my friends made me watch it i love it i love it

3879075 with ongoing experimentation and guidance from the medical community medpedia could provide a similar benefit to the world in the specialized area of health and medicine
3879076 while the conflict has aroused the predictable hostility and posturing of the u s government
3879077 in the annals of u s russian relations secretary of state rice has proven once again to be not up to the task at effectively managing the one area of foreign policy that is her principal area of expertise
3879078 im not bothered by 41 having an oedipal thing to work out with 43 i just wish it they could do it around the dinner table instead of breaking so much crockery on the world stage
3879079 let me be perfectly clear israel is a strong friend of israels
3879080 barack obama will require you to work he is going to demand that you shed your cynicism that you come out of your isolation barack will never allow you to go back to your lives as usual uninvolved uninformed
3879081 what would i do id shut apple down and give the money back to the shareholders
3879082 dear citizen youve no doubt noticed that the world is a troubled place people are apathetic lazy unmotivated youve probably asked yourself why isnt anything being done to stop this systematic decline well youll be happy to know measures are being taken we your government have decided society needs a wake up call so beginning today we will randomly select a different citizen who will be killed within 24 hours of notification we believe this will help remind all people how precious life is and how important it is to be productive active members of society congratulations you have been randomly selected by the government to die in 24 hours
3879083 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
3879084 after these norms qip issues will be in line with contemporary market conditions before this companies were finding it difficult to sell their issues as the floor price was higher than the prevailing market price owing to the recent market meltdown
3879085 globally the issue price is fixed on the basis of the price of the stocks on the day of issue we are yet to reach that stage
3879086 this too will be reviewed even 43 days is not the ideal time we are looking to see if it is possible to change the process itself rather than just reducing the time
3879087 we examined the p note data but we did not see anything out of the ordinary so the guidelines stand unchanged
3879088 the eu now has all the tools it needs in order to become a true totalitarian entity and it has managed successfully to corrupt the national elites to sell out the freedom of their peoples by inviting them to take part in the worlds largest racket paid for by european taxpayers
3879089 fewer than the number of staff employed by a typical medium sized city council in europe
3879090 the commission desperately tries to play down just how many people are now working for the eu they are extremely secretive about the number of people who are working to churn out regulations
3879091 these people are not elected and cannot be held accountable by ordinary citizens but they have a huge effect on our lives affecting everything from the price of electricity and food to the way we run the nhs
3879092 the huge number of people now working for the eu reflects its huge influence the difficulty of finding out how many officials are working there reflects the eus wider problem with a lack of transparency it is a complicated and opaque institution which leaves it wide open to influence from lobbyists and vested interests
3879093 the day to day running of the commission is in the hands of administrative officials experts translators interpreters and secretarial staff there are approximately 23 000 of these european civil servants that may sound a lot but in fact it is fewer than the number of staff employed by a typical medium sized city council in europe
3879094 how the european union works your guide to the eu institutions
3879095 reasons to celebrate the european unions 50th birthday number 14 about 24 000 employees fewer than the bbc employs are helping 27 nations to come together
3879096 coke as well as coking coal supplies are very tight and inventories continue to be low
3879097 it is good that crude oil prices have come down therefore coal prices should also come down this is a positive development but we do not know if this would last
3879098 we shall fight we will win paris london rome berlin
3879099 we get from time to time people saying youre biased in favour of the labour party every time i ask people show me a case of that bias explain to me where we got it wrong and why what we said was so unfair they seem to be unable to do so
3879100 the bbc is not impartial or neutral its a publicly funded urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people ethnic minorities and gay people it has a liberal bias not so much a party political bias it is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias
3879101 its not a conspiracy its visceral they think they are on the middle ground
3879102 the idea of a tax on the ownership of a television belongs in the 1950s why not tax people for owning a washing machine to fund the manufacture of persil
3879103 people who know a lot more than i do may be right when they claim that global warming is the consequence of our own behaviour i assume that this is why the bbcs coverage of the issue abandoned the pretence of impartiality long ago
3879104 the real shradanjali to kiranjit is to toe the line of her courage that she had shown even in her death
3879105 women must pledge to save themselves as kiranjit and now manpreet did
3879106 the anger of residents against kiranjits killing can be gauged from the fact that hordes of people came out to pay their tributes and are willing to strive against any highhandedness
3879107 why dont i start doing the photo a day blogging thing again but this time with a twist
3879108 she wanted to try for a baby after the spice girls finished touring but shes put her plans on hold while she sees what can be done to help her she knows she is putting her health at risk if she dismisses the advice of her doctors and has another c section
3879109 noi lo ritenevamo ha detto una volta salvatore boemi procuratore aggiunto della dda di reggio calabria rappresentando un sentire comune a tutti coloro che lo conoscevano uno dei magistrati pi preparati che ci fossero presso la suprema corte di cassazione per noi era un punto di riferimento stabile ed era sicuramente un motivo di orgoglio sapere che il braccio destro del procuratore generale era calabrese e constatare quanta fiducia cera nelle capacit professionali di questuomo che lo dobbiamo ricordare ebbe gli incarichi pi delicati e tratt i ricorsi di procedimenti tra i pi importanti della storia democratica del dopoguerra
3879110 ai bimbi rom diamo carezze anziche prenderne le impronte digitali
3879111 ci auguriamo non sia vero il sospetto che in italia stia rinascendo il fascismo sotto altre forme abbiamo definito indecente la proposta del ministro maroni sui bambini rom perch da un lato basta censirli aiutarli a integrarsi con la societ civile in cui vivono marginalizzati ma dallaltro bisogna evitargli la vergogna di vedersi marcati per tutta la vita come membri di un gruppo etnico considerato in potenza tutto esposto alla criminalit quella foto del bimbo ebreo nel ghetto di varsavia con le mani alzate davanti alle ss venuta alla memoria come un simbolo per questo il parlamento di strasburgo e il consiglio europeo hanno protestato
3879112 come colei che meglio di tante altre pur valentissime donne potrebbe rappresentare il volto femmnile della calabria cos come noi avevamo indicato inutile tentare di nasconderlo ci riempie dorgoglio
3879113 per un popolo civile non vi nulla di pi vergognoso che lasciarsi governare senza opporre resistenza da una cricca di capi privi di scrupoli e dominati da torbidi istinti
3879114 bisogna avere il coraggio e lonest la politica deve essere fatta con le mani pulite
3879115 the july numbers were essentially in line with estimates so the initial reaction to them was understandably muted the report overall though is on the soft side

3879122 i see how they do it and by gosh i can do it too
3879123 its a little bit more attention a little bit more pressure on your shoulders from the coaches which i think is a good thing the more pressure
3879124 thats one of the things we talked about was getting jim more rep etition s this camp even before peytons situation so he could get comfortable and improve
3879125 i think it really has helped him you can see the confidence he has gained by it
3879126 youre taking so many reps when youre the no 1 guy
3879127 the legs get a little tired and a little sore theres a little more maintenance work that has to be done when youre taking so many reps icing cooling down getting warmed up and cold tub

3879147 if he said hes iron man in the first film its one thing to say it and another thing to evolve to a point where you can live in a heroic fashion
3879148 our goal is also more of the same in iron man 2 we want to do what worked for us last time im talking about telling more of the story of a guy put in extraordinary circumstances who has a family now and hes dealing with these forces in iron man 2 you will be able to understand various points of view about him that are far reaching while this guy is still grounded in reality
3879149 my whole thing is that that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so f king smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what f k dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from

3879151 each year as many as 50 infants are placed on the waiting list for cardiac transplantation but die while waiting owing to the lack of a suitable donor heart
3879152 adding an additional two three or five minutes or even 75 seconds does add some additional injury it could be 10 percent
3879153 the 6 month survival rate was 100 percent for the 3 transplant recipients and 84 percent for 17 control infants who received transplants procured through standard organ donation
3879154 as a result of their investigational protocol three babies are now alive had the procedures not been performed it is virtually certain that all six babies would be dead
3879155 removing organs from a patient whose heart not only can be restarted but also has been or will be restarted in another body is ending a life by organ removal
3879156 mccain wouldnt have been our person but we definitely feel like it would be a huge help to john mccain to pick someone we can be confident will represent the value voter position i dont think it helps him mccain at all in ohio if he picks romney
3879157 theres been a bit of tension for some time they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved
3879158 id love them unconditionally if they wanted to id just as soon as they have a more normal childhood
3879159 i was shocked a little bit shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby it was mind boggling
3879160 im sure the boys will be like big brothers to maddie
3879161 god has a way of taking something bad and turning it into something good if this hadnt happened i would never have been able to get back with my daughter and have this relationship i have with these two little boys
3879162 over the years with our investors in people recognition our ongoing training with structured outlooks help and guidance from local chamber of commerce business link and chester business club we feel honored to be shortlisted for these awards and would like to offer thanks for their valued input helping us achieve our goals its greatly appreciated
3879163 jacqueline gold brought the adult industry to the forefront of peoples minds in the 90s with her well recognised ann summers brand and home party plans her business focus determination to succeed has earned her a place in the history books
3879164 the adult industry is a particularly male dominated environment entering into it nine years ago as a female with a wealth of ideas on how we could improve the business and the industry as a whole was uncertain ground so its incredibly rewarding to be recognised for the input hard work and vision that helped shape the north wests leading chain of adult stores that is nice n naughty
3879165 at nice n naughty we believe that its a real team effort and we wholeheartedly recognise the importance of each individual staff member that they are essential elements that operate and power the nice n naughty machine our healthy work environment and business culture ensure the staff are motivated listened to developed and rewarded
3879166 our staff get good wages conditions health benefits and even gym membership so its easy for us to attract high calibre workers hopefully our business philosophy and continued awards success will help break down barriers and change peoples perceptions of sex shops as seedy back street premises with boarded up windows
3879167 if foreign oil has us over a barrel now what happens when our population increases by another 100 million
3879168 with americas population at a record 300 million today oil supplies are again tight in spite of record high prices and the u s census bureau projects that another 110 million people will be added to our population between 2000 and 2040
3879169 significantly increases world wide co2 emissions because it transfers population from lower polluting parts of the world to the united states which is a higher polluting country
3879170 he came in and went into this office and started shooting
3879171 i thought maybe someone had gotten hit by a car
3879172 she said she was waiting on the gentleman he wanted to see the chairman she tried to give him democratic party stuff
3879173 evidently he walked on around her and went in the office and started shooting
3879174 stunned and shaken by todays shooting at the arkansas democratic party where our good friend and fellow democrat bill gwatney was critically wounded bill is not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but he is also a cherished friend and confidante our thoughts and prayers are with bill and his family today and we wish him a quick recovery
3879175 ive heard he said something do to about losing a job he didnt threaten anyone
3879176 we havent canceled any shows its a full go starting on aug 23
3879177 there are several totally untrue rumors currently floating around about madonna one is that she is canceling shows canceling a birthday party that shes adopting a second child from malawi and that she hurt her ankle none of these are true
3879178 im really bummed i think she should definitely get paid as much as either of us is getting paid her father created the show it just seems wrong if thats the case
3879179 they didnt even get the numbers right so i dont know if its about the money either
3879180 director clark gregg knew that id written choke while listening to pablo honey with creep over and over and over
3879181 so clark got radiohead to contribute a song to write a song for the very end of the movie the final credits
3879182 apparently radiohead liked the movie so much theyve written the score its a living dream
3879183 en su momento nos reunimos con la presidenta y esta semana con el jefe de gabinete para hacer un repaso de toda la agenda que obviamente inclu a el tema de las asignaciones familiares y del impuesto a las ganancias
3879184 es una idea que se repite en el gobierno la de actualizar tanto las asignaciones familiares como el m nimo para el pago de el impuesto a las ganancias
3879185 este a o el gobierno ha decidi generar una movilidad tanto en asignaciones familiares como en ganancias y estamos analizando las distintas alternativas y lo vamos a hacer dialogando como siempre con la cgt
3879186 me da la impresi n de que eso todav a no est en la agenda ni de la cgt ni en la de los gremios en particular
3879187 la mayor a de los gremios pactaron aumentos salariales en forma escalonada y la ltima parte de esos ajustes los trabajadores los estar n cobrando en septiembre octubre o noviembre
3879188 looks like a f ing carpet thrown into a bath tub with a chewbacca mask on top
3879189 the chance to see a bigfoot captured on live television
3879190 searching for bigfoot inc has exclusive rights to all publishing rights photo rights television and film rights production and distribution rights and other commercial opportunities related to the discovery and findings regarding this body and these creatures
3879191 would you allow one of our people to come down and verify the body
3879192 the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body was the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi
3879193 they looked close though as soon as they saw the camera they walked apart as if trying to keep it secret
3879194 rhys has really been going for it hes had a trail of stunning women running around after him and has been the life and soul of every party hes been to in the last week
3879195 that was a screw up we fixed that were not perfect

3879210 mike adamle might not have worked as a commentator but he might actually work as gm
3879211 but there are always other victims in cases like this and ms irizarry is also a victim she lives with this every single day
3879212 we were interested in there being a full and complete investigation in this case and not just where it involved the case today but the entire case and the entire group of people that were involved
3879213 we felt like we asked the board to do what compassionate people ought to do and that is allow victims of malpractice to personally appear before the board and testify or discuss the effect of what happened on them
3879214 i know that these countries they need help all kinds of help and when you come to a developed country i had the chance to train in good universities like mcgill universitys surgery ive been working in an excellent hospital here in sherbrooke and i feel it is my obligation to give some time and expertise to these poor populations
3879215 the meeting was set up in order to share information back and forth between us it was not set up as a meeting to come to any final decision
3879216 we certainly implied to wiseman and he agreed that this had to be a high level meeting
3879217 we have to have people present who have the authority to make some very definite decisions
3879218 i dont know if they were actually planning to move people
3879219 i think it was more to keep the general public from becoming upset at the fact that this could actually happen
3879220 they have to have a plan in place and the physicians have had offers

3879222 its not like you live at fort hood or camp lejeune and everybody on your street is in the military
3879223 its not age per se that when you get to 80 its all over with
3879224 its driven by more proximate factors such as if you become obese or youre smoking too much or you contract diabetes medications can depress sexual interest the aging process itself is not a major factor driving these results
3879225 if sexual health goes to hell it may be a canary in the mine shaft it may be a sign of health problems
3879226 the ability to do a test from a spit rather than from a blood test really opens up this field to women who traditionally had not been eligible or had not had access to the services
3879227 when you have a child you want all the knowledge possible so that you can take whatever care you have to
3879228 if you can put to rest the mind that frantically seeks from moment to moment you will be no different from old shakyamuni buddha
3879229 empty and open in my daily activities theres not a single thing opposing me finally i realize that all things in the three worlds are fundamentally nonexistent truly this is peaqce and happiness joyful liveliness having cast it all away

3879252 we are unapologetic about our role in the amarnath agitation it is the response of the masses due to the accumulation of their grievances if parties supporting upa can plead for organisation like simi why cant we stand with the masses
3879253 were certainly seeing some cooler temperatures associated with the dry south westerly airstream
3879254 theres still a bit of high cloud about but with the cloud clearing forward well probably see similar temperatures tomorrow as well
3879255 that means theres more onshore flow and it should increase the moisture in the air a little bit
3879256 the rainfalls likely to be above average as well which is good news
3879257 but the reality is i dont believe were at the bottom of this economic downturn were just going to have to work through it and work through it together

3879268 struggling northern cities will never be able to regenerate and should be given up a tory think tank with close links to david cameron concludes today and sunderland should be encouraged to move to the more prosperous south east it says
3879269 what we need is a critique of visual culture that is alert to the power of images for good and evil and that is capable of discriminating the variety and historical specificity of their uses
3879270 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
3879271 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
3879272 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters know is who uses that language for what purpose
3879273 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
3879274 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
3879275 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
3879276 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
3879277 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
3879278 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
3879279 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
3879280 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
3879281 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
3879282 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
3879283 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
3879284 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
3879285 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
3879286 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
3879287 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
3879288 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
3879289 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
3879290 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
3879291 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
3879292 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
3879293 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
3879294 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
3879295 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
3879296 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
3879297 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
3879298 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
3879299 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
3879300 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
3879301 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
3879302 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
3879303 we think crysis warhead is going to offer a tremendous experience to a wide range of gamers
3879304 fans of crysis are going to enjoy more of the open ended gameplay cutting edge visuals and huge epic battles from the first game while also finally finding out what kind of havoc psycho was wreaking on the other side of the island at the same time we designed warhead to be more accessible for gamers new to the crysis franchise it is a standalone game with a story that can stand on its own it has been optimized to run better on a wider range of pcs and we are introducing crysis wars a tailor made experience for multiplayer gamers within the crysis universe all at a great value

3879306 me and my sisters didnt work hard so you and yours could fuck it up
3879307 these appeared at the end of a very stormy day
3879308 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
3879309 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
3879310 if it is an underlying problem with the processor that makes repairing it either difficult or impossible if that is the case that could be a disaster for apple
3879311 in any case the 3g performance is obviously a problem
3879312 sitting on your hands and either not discussing the issue publicly or claiming there is no problem when a firestorm of people are online complaining about difficulties means the inferno is just going to get bigger and bigger
3879313 if apple finally does admit there is some sort of systemic issue the result would be disastrous
3879314 apple installing a kill switch and not telling anyone caused a firestorm in the application developer community online
3879315 this is a solo album but co op aint over its still a movement
3879316 he was just a little kid finally learning to walk used to watch mtv listening to them talk patterns and rhythms deep in his heart hed give anything to be them in a b boy pose you should have seen him his parents passed it off as a phase didnt notice how the music affected him somehow expected him to grow out of it but he was too far in he didnt study shakespeare he analyzed rakim used to write down all of his verses and memorize them practicing in the mirror to the beat a capella he prayed every night that hed come up with something clever staring at the page so still at his fingers eventually they moved and with time they got better the untrained eye would probably say it was nothing but he knew it was a start of something
3879317 im independent if you know what that means its just me myself and i i aint got no team aint no record company to advance that cream so im living verse to verse just to live my dream
3879318 the pipeline route proposed by shannon lng in its secret agreement with bord plean la is at least two miles from the power station with no consideration whatsoever being given on where or how the pipeline could be linked to the esb station
3879319 now calling on kerry county council to demand as a minimum a strategic assessment of the oil and gas storage hub now proposed for the shannon estuary
3879320 if the dangerous lng storage facility is to be forced on north kerry the least that the council can do in return for the millions that it will receive each year in rates is to ensure that north kerry has access to the gas for the development of the region it is no use looking for it once permission is given for the route preferred by the developer
3879321 there is never going to be a moment when we as a society ask ourselves
3879322 the web is not a perfect antidote to the problems of mass media because some of the problems are human and not amenable to technological fixes

3879326 we provided intake documentation and the judge said it was insufficient
3879327 the judge said he should have informed the court sooner and because it was the second time hed missed court in this case she issued the warrant
3879328 working towards getting him some help and we hope that will be taken seriously by all parties in this case
3879329 he qualified for us and he feels comfortable with me
3879330 we have to work out an arrangement that will work with the courts
3879331 we are in court again next week on other matters and my hope is we can get the warrant resolved by then and get back on track we have some things in the works to get the warrant taken care of my hope is that we can resolve it without an arrest but hes been arrested at the airport before so they obviously have an eye out for him so im not sure
3879332 i think we should have scored in the first half
3879333 you dont get many chances and you have to take them we didnt do that we lost concentration on two occasions and got punished
3879334 thats what happens in europe against the top teams the inexperience in the dressing room showed and we have to learn from it but i cant fault the performance we had arsenal rattled especially in the first half
3879335 it was very difficult to play against that team they started very well and it was important for us to be strong
3879336 they were very passionate but in the second half we worked hard because we want to qualify for the champions league it is a big competition for us
3879337 governments like clocks go from the motion men give them

3879352 practically everyone on earth can relate to it and yet it appeared within the last 20 years its an archival object that marks our place in history
3879353 obviously the sculptures are made of a lot of phones on an individual basis but 5000 phones is just a fraction of the number of phones that go into landfill every day whole villages and forests are torn down in africa for the mining of the metals needed to make smaller batteries and lcd screens these tiny objects have changed the landscape dramatically in the last 20years
3879354 i like my phone camera because its always on and its light to carry around
3879355 and i like the way the photos have that second generation degraded quality so they look like surveillance photos or photos of a crime scene
3879356 my phone is quite old i dont know what the model is called

3879373 the developed countries lie directly in the path of a great storm
3879374 a whole array of organizations that serve the overall ideological and political battle plan to halt immigration even if those groups have somewhat differing politics
3879375 immigration to the united states significantly increased world wide co2 emissions because it transfers population from lower polluting parts of the world to the united states which is a higher polluting country on average immigrants increase their emissions four fold by coming to america

3879382 in a preemptive strike against possible rumors regarding the games progress realtime president tony harman also explained why the studio didnt showcase apb at e3 in july
3879383 we just cant wink at it and pretend it doesnt exist
3879384 i would characterize this as an issue which engenders a lot of passion
3879385 i think its sad that a person who became a public servant to allegedly help people would go out there and say let me see how i can harm people
3879386 i sincerely hope they would do the right thing and not fold to political pressure
3879387 scott came in a lot of times he was a recognizable figure

3879390 troy university has always been interested in providing opportunities for young people to better themselves and this is a situation where a young man who has made some mistakes is looking for a second chance
3879391 i have met with josh and i am convinced that he is ready and willing to do the things we need for him to do to be a productive member of both this football team and the troy university community
3879392 if we would have been given 2 or 3 more armies then we would have beaten the enemy easily
3879393 you shall not lie with man as one lies with a women this is an abomination
3879394 if a man also lie with mankind as he lieth with a woman both of them have committed an abomination they should surely be put to death
3879395 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of god

3879397 reflecting new democratic optimism about the south former virginia gov mark r warner will keynote the partys national convention in denver two weeks from now
3879398 warner appealed successfully to nascar democrats in his election as governor running strongly in rural areas and with working class social conservatives
3879399 warner 53 briefly sought the democratic presidential nomination but dropped out to pursue a u s senate race against another former governor republican jim gilmore warner is far ahead in polls and fundraising
3879400 the resources his campaign are pouring into the old dominion are emblematic of the partys optimism about cracking into the gops solid hold on the souths electoral vote
3879401 warner has a post partisan message thats similar to obamas
3879402 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3879403 hes in very critical condition the family is doing the best they can theyre shocked like the rest of us

3879405 i was shocked and saddened to hear about the tragedy in arkansas were all grateful for the quick action of law enforcement and quick thinking by chairman gwatneys staff and michelle and i are keeping him and his family in our prayers
3879406 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3879407 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3879408 you never think of something like this happening here in arkansas
3879409 our thoughts and prayers go out to chairman gwatney and his family and we pray for his full and speedy recovery
3879410 we commend the courageous and speedy action of law enforcement officials in apprehending the suspect
3879411 were sure that theres probably some facts and information thats just not available i mean you see a lot on the video but we need to make sure everything is revealed before we take any action
3879412 if theres a gun on the wall at the beginning of the play by the end it must go off
3879413 weve done the military thing for eight years and were tired
3879414 its amazing because theyve been such a big influence ever since we grew up
3879415 its kind of too good to be true i was like a little giddy kid at christmas when i heard that we got to do this tour
3879416 daltry and townshend they dont actually interact much because theyve been there and done that so they kind of get driven to the stage they do their show and they kind of get driven away
3879417 were used to doing little pub shows running in trying to get sound ready but this was really easy we got treated super nice
3879418 were usually not even used to getting anything in a dressing room well get a bit of water and maybe a case of beer it was a little nice to be pampered a bit with good food and it was kind of out of the ordinary
3879419 right now everyones a little frustrated in the music industry
3879420 theres been so much change and everyones just trying to keep their head above water
3879421 with sales and how all the labels have changed and how all the rules have changed and i think its just that much harder to get an album out these days on a major label
3879422 but you know ive got plenty of stuff on my hands mostly about work
3879423 oh youve got to excuse me now its my cat or rather its a stray cat im keeping until i can bring it back to his owners please keep talking

3879436 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
3879437 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
3879438 if it is an underlying problem with the processor that makes repairing it either difficult or impossible if that is the case that could be a disaster for apple
3879439 in any case the 3g performance is obviously a problem
3879440 sitting on your hands and either not discussing the issue publicly or claiming there is no problem when a firestorm of people are online complaining about difficulties means the inferno is just going to get bigger and bigger
3879441 if apple finally does admit there is some sort of systemic issue the result would be disastrous
3879442 apple installing a kill switch and not telling anyone caused a firestorm in the application developer community online
3879443 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss

3879875 its a very very awesome prison i majored in architecture in college and design is how i actually started in for super max designing that prison it had to be the kind of thing that was a character in and of itself
3879876 were in a world where instead of just trying to contain a guy whos really big youre trying to contain a guy who can in the case of icicle who can freeze things what kind of a cell would a guy like that need in order to have his powers neutralized so to escape from super max they have got to go through the most elaborate heist weve ever seen involving superpowers because the prison itself kind of has superpowers
3879877 what we wanted to do and i think well continue to do as the studio continues to push the movie forward is to be able to put queen in the center of a much bigger universe
3879878 in the same way that marvel is starting to do when youre in the filmed dc universe where this world and this world and this world they all exist in an interrelated web its the kind of thing that i think absolutely is about spelling out a couple different roads for a couple different characters
3879879 by the time a movie like this comes out we will all understand origin stories and mainstream audiences now are willing to suspend their disbelief to the point that we can believe that a world exists where superpowers exist and people dress up in costumes so now what now what do we do and i call this superhero 2 0
3879880 we do deal with his origin hes got a very interesting origin with a desert island and everything else but we get to the core of green arrow not by showing where he starts but by pushing him into a key moment in his life where everything he has is lost and hes got to earn it all back i think for audiences its going to be a great way to get to know a new character

3879889 we see infrastructure investments generally as a good fit with the pension fund because it s a long term stable investment
3879890 it s a continuation of our move to get a better balance between public assets and private assets and try to reduce some of that volatility that we are getting in the public markets
3879891 our long term goal is to have it more like 57 5 per cent public and 42 5 per cent private we re trying to get a better balance as are a lot of pension funds

3879898 this album is based on the musical roots of my family
3879899 i like to think of it as a remembrance and tribute to the memory of that amazing time in my life i have dedicated this album to the memory of my maternal grandma reva vickery she was right there all along playing a big part in the making of those memories in the late 90s she was struck with the horrible disease alzheimers it shook our family to the core that jovial rolly polly woman who reminded me of lou costello disappeared behind her large glasses alzheimers renders your mind blank as years of your personal history disappear it causes you to behave unlike the person you were all your life even forget the name of the man you have been married to for over 50 years or the fact that you were married to him at all
3879900 this music is for her for the last several years of her life due to her alzheimers she couldnt remember many things about her life or her family but she always enjoyed the music
3879901 im glad they are there and hope you will join me in helping them help others in finding a cure for this disease

3879904 andrew and i were very proud of the beautiful game but it wound up being a very dark and grim show when we opened there were still acts of terrorism taking place between and that influenced us we chose i think mistakenly to leave our hero not only unredeemed at the end of the story but morally destroyed as well and thats not the kind of message andrew and i like to leave with an audience

3879906 we were essentially following up on the reports from last night and this morning that the bear was creating quite a stir in a place where there was a lot more people and traffic than we would prefer

3879911 our government is pleased to announce these important changes in health care services that will better serve the unique needs of aboriginal people in nova scotia

3879919 we disagree with the demonstrators though we respect their right to protest against the bar council forum which must be done peacefully and civilly
3879920 it is sad that for the past five days not a single word has been said by prime minister datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawi deputy prime minister datuk seri najib razak and home minister datuk seri syed hamid albar to deplore the uncivil and irresponsible conduct of those who had taken the law into their hands to storm also those who threatened to storm and disrupt a lawful meeting on private premises
3879921 i blame the government for the bar councils arrogant attitude and for ignoring the compact made previously
3879922 protests can be stopped but their feelings can rise and they will get angrier due to the bar councils arrogance to continue organising such forums
3879923 when judge ian chin accused me of allegedly threatening judges bar council president ambiga sreenivasan pushed for the goverment to investigate me
3879924 the government should not fear anything and just prioritise personal popularity but think of the countrys interests
3879925 maybe such an agreement denies rights in a democracy but democracy is for our good and we should not sacrifice our good for democracy we should not be shy that our democracy is less liberal than the democracy in some of the developed countries
3879926 what is good for them is not necessarily good for us what is important in democracy is the right to vote to decide the government
3879927 if we can be supportive of cross civilisational dialogues or discourses globally i see no reason why we should have reservations and impose inhibitions on the same initiatives in our own country
3879928 if we talk about understanding and unity among each other we should not politicise these issues and deem them as sensitive we need to be frank and address these issues as this is the only way forward
3879929 malaysians appear to be united and living harmoniously but in actual fact many issues are swept under the carpet which may eventually blow up one day
3879930 i urge the government to resolve the issue quickly which safeguards the rights of both muslims and non muslims alike he said
3879931 where a spouse or family member has embraced islam the conversion effectively has an effect on the non muslim family members since it involves human rights with regards to the welfare of family members who have not converted there are custodian problems where minor children are involved and inheritance issues too
3879932 especially the lawyers lah who think anything from the west is always better than from the east my advice to them is simple pack your belongings and get out from this country better still go back to india or china see how they treat you there

3879940 caseys father contrary to the latest spin was not denied the right to speak at the 1992 convention because he didnt endorse bill clinton
3879941 the democrats with the help of their friends in the media will now use the pennsylvania pro abortion senator to sell the message that they have gotten beyond their anti catholic reputation that reputation which was played out in 1992 by delegates who wore anti papal buttons at the convention still sticks if they are serious about reaching out to catholics and jettisoning their anti catholic baggage once and for all they can allow a prominent catholic to speak in denver who is truly pro life that should be an easy choice to make given the small pool of eligible candidates
