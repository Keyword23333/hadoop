4400000 basrawis realised what a nightmare literally that was theyre not going to put themselves back through that period of violent extremism
4400001 they have got better things to do now with their lives and i do not see basra coming back under militia control those days are passed
4400002 the troop numbers will be tailored to what that mission is
4400003 its not really helpful to speculate at the moment but as security improves and iraqi forces improve their capabilities which they are doing daily then obviously theres scope for numbers to be reviewed
4400004 the more we start to get foreign investment in there the better but a combination of security and investment means basra has an extremely bright future
4400005 make the transition to a long term bilateral relationship with iraq
4400006 in a country that is going to become extremely wealthy and important in the region where our influence will be very beneficial

4400024 instead of allowing the court to reexamine the matter with the new information mr corbett chose to conclude there was no justification to reopen the case
4400025 mr corbett disregarded the wishes of dr barnes and the interests of this community
4400026 the foundations move has been thoroughly vetted and judicially determined to be the best available alternative
4400027 it will actually enable the foundation to increase its exposure to the common people dr barnes intended to reach while retaining its existing facilities to display additional artifacts that have been in storage due to a lack of gallery space

4400036 i remember jeff westlake getting his first guitar jeff is now doing great as the lead guitarist of hydrogyn i remembering seeing my first concert molly hatchet in huntington with jeff on the flirting with disaster tour ajs music is heavily influenced by hatchet and seein dio in charleston with jeff in the early 80s jeff has an ex dio guitarist craig goldy in his band now
4400037 in the late 80s i worked on the night crew at big bear some of my co workers and i would get off work on saturday around midnight and head down to the old ragtime lounge to see a local newcomer a new guy from flatwoods named billy ray cyrus played there for years and i watched him in the late 80s he filled the bar with women but i enjoyed his music he loved lynyrd skynyd hed come up to my table and would always say wanna hear some skynyrd ill play ya some skynyrd he did a great version of billy idols rebel yell best i ever heard you could tell he was gonna be big i miss hearing the classics that he sang ever week but never recorded there was the tri state classic it aint over until its over id love to have that mp3 but doubt if its around i miss hearing babysitter remember the original version of should i stay or go and an alternate version of appalachian lady these songs are lost in time because he never released them i remember being at the paramount theatre for the filming of the achy breaky heart video it took over 20 takes there is a brief glimpse of gators back as the video comes on
4400038 i remember in the early 90s bragging to my mom and dad about how great billy ray is and how big he was going to be and that he was signed to mercury records they said that my cousin scott was going to release a cd i was like really i wasnt impressed scott was my second cousin my uncle rips grandson i met him only a couple of times when we visited his family in chagrin falls near cleveland and stayed with them a few days he was a dennis the menace type kid and i couldnt imagine him being a singer he was in california living and his band mighty joe young was recording a cd lil cousin scott due to the fact that an old blues singer had the name mighty joe young had been copywritten so they changed their name to stone temple pilots though my cousin scott weiland now sings with a band named velvet revolver with some big hat wearin guy named slash
4400039 they have stepped up to the plate and their partnership is why we are able to take over the mission that the georgians had to leave behind with no change in the security and safety of the iraqi people

4400045 i have no doubt he will be a success in the premier league he only needs a little time to adapt to what is going on scolaris position at chelsea was crucial to my decision to join this club
4400046 were capable of going to ibrox and getting a result were respectful of rangers but were not afraid

4400050 i told calderon we have a proposal of 25 4 million from chelsea and that robinho wants to leave
4400051 robinho said there is no point being unhappy and unproductive at the club
4400052 but calderon said he would not sell even for 100 million i left the meeting thinking that was that but after talking to other leaders of the club i saw that this position might change
4400053 robinho told calderon he was treating him the same as fifa president sepp blatter had said manchester united were doing with cristiano ronaldo that is slavery
4400054 now we are in negotiations with tottenham and some clarity is likely to come on friday evening

4400075 theyre saying here is my cat here is my dog and i am here because i cannot afford to feed this animal i cannot afford vet care
4400076 i came in one day and found a carrier and a note with a vet bill that said please take care of him
4400077 i actually have a fish in my office right now that somebody who had been evicted from their home apparently left behind
4400078 he needs somebody who can take him to the vet on a regular basis and maybe somebody who has more than one animal so he can have companions if i cant afford one animal i sure cant afford two
4400079 he loves to go traveling and to ride in the car and stuff and i cant even do that because my car is broke down and i cant afford to have it fixed
4400080 theyve had to downsize and cant take the pets with them or they cant keep up with the cost of vet bills things like that
4400081 theyll say well we just cant afford to care for it anymore
4400082 if people are having problems with money they may not initially give the dog up
4400083 they may skimp on the food or not bring it to the vet for shots itll take longer to see the effects from that

4400085 i appeal for the help of every civilized person in the world to stop this uncivilized barbarian inhuman treacherous absolutely outrageous behavior and to save innocent lives
4400086 the fact that the biggest number of bombs fell on purely economic and civilian targets clearly indicated that was a premeditated thing and it had nothing to do only with abkhazia or south ossetia
4400087 alle bliver udsat for det i den offentlige sektor men den fungerer ikke s rligt meget bedre af den grund t nk p plejehjemmene p hospitalerne p togene og p skolerne alle de centrale offentlige produktions og serviceomr der bliver jo dagligt kritiseret for ikke at fungere men dermed vokser argumenterne bare for endnu mere kontrol og endnu mere styring
4400088 det var en bev gelse over hele den vestlige verden i h j grad med ronald reagan og margaret thatcher i spidsen et fors g p at g re den offentlige sektor mere effektiv og performanceorienteret ved at give markedskr fterne en st rre rolle og at efterligne den private sektors styringsformer i danmark oplevede man det som et opg r med regeltyranniet fra de foreg ende rtier
4400089 og det var en god ting i sit udgangspunkt at producenterne af det der med et fort rsket ord kaldes offentlig service skal konfronteres med brugernes krav og behov og med de konomiske realiteter der er noget sundt i at sige at fagfolkene skal g re rede for hvad der kommer ud af vores skattepenge
4400090 men efterh nden er kontrakterne og de medh rende t lleregimer blevet meningsl se der er puttet s mange detaljer ind i dem at der ikke er noget frirum man kontrollerer og m ler alt hvad der foreg r og det er helt ude til de lokale ledere i det yderste produktionsled
4400091 en plejehjemsleder er i dag komplet usynlig hun er s optaget af det administrative hvor hun skal dokumentere hvor mange timer der er brugt p reng ring vask madlavning og kontakt til de ldre og det g r helt ned til plejehjemspersonalet der skal registrere n rmest hver en bev gelse de foretager det er et paradoks at offentlig produktion der burde v re en del af vidensamfundet skal styres som en fabrik fra begyndelsen af 1900 tallet
4400092 vi har udviklet et nul fejls regime da der for eksempel skete en fejl i f devarekontrollen der ikke havde kontrolleret noget gammelt k d s indf rte man ekstra kontrol for at sikre at det ikke skete igen s konstaterede man at det ikke virkede og indf rte endnu mere kontrol p trods af at alle kan se at en s dan kontrol aldrig vil virke 100 procent og til sidst r g lars barfoed som familie og forbrugerminister det er s dan noget som politikerne er afm gtige over for
4400093 vi forskere her p handelsh jskolen bliver for eksempel m lt p hvor mange publikationer vi producerer men det er i virkeligheden et underligt m l for antallet siger jo ikke noget om hvor stor deres relevans innovationsv rdi nyhedsv rdi eller originalitet er
4400094 m leregimerne har taget overh nd og det har fortr ngt ledernes rolle som igangs ttere og fornyere og det er paradoksalt for alt det her skulle jo netop skabe en st rk ledelseskraft i det offentlige og det er der stort behov for med de store udfordringer sektoren st r overfor vi skal i fremtiden producere langt mere v rdi med langt f rre mennesker og f rre ressourcer det kr ver st rk ledelseskraft
4400095 man er n dt til at g en tak dybere ned og se p hvad der er vigtigt for kvaliteten for eksempel b rnenes udvikling trivsel eller skolemodenhed i mods tning til hvor mange p dagogtimer de har til r dighed i dag har vi en abstraktion om at alle ydelser kan standardiseres og forenkles til enkeltelementer der er nemme at sammenligne men denne industritankegang skal vi forlade hurtigst muligt for den er farlig b de for institutionernes faglige stolthed brugerorientering og evne til fornyelse
4400096 det fortr ngte offentlige lederskab om t lleregimerne der tog overh nd

4400098 hope that we will see retail shareholder participation improve as more companies use e proxy and learn how to adjust its features as investors become more familiar with electronic voting and as more investors desiring paper copies make their one time election
4400099 so hopefully this will not continue to be the issue that it has been this season
4400100 of course brazil is a favorite for the gold medal but i think we are too
4400101 having sat out argentinas last game messi will be fresh to take on the dutch playmaker juan riquelme also was given the evening off against the serbs and the talented pair will look to open up the dutch defense
4400102 argentina has all the pressure on them because they are the defending champions and a big favorite for the tournament
4400103 the italians won the bronze medal four years ago in athens and are looking to improve on that they reached the last eight without conceding a goal although goalkeeper emiliano viviano had to save a penalty in their third group game
4400104 if were going to relocate that decision needs to be made in the next few days so time is of the essence
4400105 the whole basis of the champions trophy is its the best eight teams the best players so not only would it be very disappointing if we had lesser teams taking the place of our major teams but even if those teams went and were understrength it would also be a disappointment to us
4400106 cricket australia chief executive james sutherland urged a speedy decision
4400107 the icc taskforce needs to report back to the icc they need to take on the advice that theyre picking up not only from feedback theyre getting from australia but also from new zealand and england and south africa and other parts of the world

4400109 ponting said uncertainty over the tournament was hard on players
4400110 thats been probably the hardest thing to tell you the truth
4400111 were only three weeks away from one of the biggest one day tournaments that we play and yet we still dont know if were going
4400112 the latvians would get no closer than 16 in the fourth quarter against australia ieva tare scored 14 points and anete jekabsone zogota added 13 for latvia 1 3
4400113 we were down and i knew i had to start being more aggressive
4400114 i dont know what it was but we werent playing well in the first half
4400115 weve been struggling but have been finding ways to win
4400116 i switched from my dress sweats to my parka shoes threw my cap and goggles on and then they pushed us on out no time
4400117 but i think theres going to be a lot of time for me to rest over the next 18 hours or so and ill be able to be ready for tomorrow mornings 100
4400118 tomorrow is going to be a tough race for me to be a player in that race i have to be closer at the 50 if im not then it will be tough i was over a body length behind at the 50 in the prelims and came up a bit short so i have to be there
4400119 i touched the wall and was like thank you finally
4400120 you can start by not worrying about what everybody else thinks
4400121 nobody knows what ive really gone through in the last eight years and what has gotten me to this point besides myself and a few people that i know well so its my own personal deal at this point
4400122 thats the theme of the meet you have to break a world record to win i gave it my all and i had nothing left
4400123 im very proud of what ive done ryan swam well he earned it
4400124 its been a long road to get here and i really cant believe that just happened

4400131 since the resources of the states are limited there will be too much of a financial burden for us to bear on our own as thousands of crores will accrue once the pay revision comes in t o effect

4400186 if youre going to score and not get them theres a chance of being overturned here kenny landed shots very cleanly in the second round i think everyone in the stadium saw them except the five guys sitting down around the ring
4400187 or at least three of them didnt see it at the same time anyway but it is worrying because it was 2 1 at that stage landing five clean shots and not getting them can break your heart
4400188 if i throw a good punch and nothing happens you can hear a bit of cursing and thats in your head if youre after landing a punch and its not coming up on the screen

4400193 but the stakes are getting higher again now the brazilian is very strong hell go for four rounds kenny has all the talent on him but hes got to bring it to the table if hes not going to be scoring hes going to struggle and this guy has a tight defence
4400194 yes ill build you a tatty wobbly fence thatll be 1365

4400401 this work changes the textbook picture of the lifecycle of the leishmaniasis parasite identifying the inflammatory cell known as the neutrophil as the predominant cell involved during the initiation of infection
4400402 parasites transmitted by sand flies to mice lacking neutrophils have more difficulty establishing an infection and surviving this demonstrates the importance of neutrophils at the site of an infected sand fly bite and suggests the unexpected path taken by the parasite from sand fly to neutrophil to macrophage is a critical component of this disease
4400403 these results represent significant progress of a t cell engaging antibody for treatment of lymphoma patients as single agent therapy we observed tumor regression in patients at serum levels of blinatumomab which are approximately five orders of magnitude lower than serum levels needed by conventional monoclonal antibodies for achieving a tumor regression in this disease this may relate to the high anti tumor activity of cytotoxic t cells recruited by blinatumomab
4400404 this first observation of durable objective responses in relapsed incurable patients indicates the potential blinatumomab and bite antibodies in general may have in fighting cancer
4400405 can potentially lead to false reassurance and may lower motivation to engage in lifestyle modifications
4400406 our goal at sister to sister is to emphasize how vital it is for women to be adequately screened for potential cardiovascular disease
4400407 it is critical not only for women but for their families because they typically are the household decision makers about diet and exercise
4400408 the global distribution of the highly pathogenic h5n1 avian influenza has caused the world health organization to show its profound concern regarding the possibility of the virus spreading from human to human in the future
4400409 furthermore the development of resistance to two approved anti influenza drugs oseltamivir tamiflu r and zanamivir relenza r as well as the lack of adequate vaccines has increased the need of developing new antiviral drugs
4400410 consequently i am delighted to be involved in the preclinical research stage of this innovative antiviral candidate and look forward to continuing our successful collaboration with canopus biopharma in this area
4400411 it is possible that higher doses of statin than those used in this study may result in even greater efficacy statc tm also appeared to be more effective when administered preventatively
4400412 we are also motivated at the potential of this compound in comparison with other currently available anti influenza medications its clear that there is significant global need for a superior low cost and plentiful alternative in the fight against influenza
4400413 the key to moving beyond theory to success and survival in real patients has been finding the right medicine to combine with lovastatin when we have administered a precisely timed regimen of low dose interferon with lovastatin tumors have begun regressing sometimes within just a few weeks
4400414 the exceptional accuracy of the qtinno tm tool was clearly validated by this third and most challenging clinical study to date the evidence unequivocally demonstrates that the qtinno tm is not only faster at measuring the qt interval compared to current manual and semi automated approaches but that it also provides proven levels of accuracy even in challenging conditions and with complex compounds we believe it provides an important additional independent validation that will help potential customers recognize the value of newcardios cardiac assessment tool in aggregate the three independent studies collectively provide newcardio with a robust clinical validation portfolio that demonstrates qtinno tm accuracy and precision in measuring key drug safety metrics across a broad range of compounds and in comparison to a variety of manual and semi automated gold standard measurements from three different sources
4400415 the company is now actively pursuing commercial validation of qtinno tm and is in discussion with potential cro partners we also anticipate developing an interface to discuss these important and compelling clinical validation data with drug regulators we will soon augment our senior management team in an effort to add sales and marketing leadership to accelerate the commercialization initiative
4400416 we already know that furin seems to have roles in a variety of human diseases such as cancer cystic fibrosis and infectious diseases
4400417 these findings show that having no furin in certain immune system cells can increase the immune response and lead to autoimmune disease in mice
4400418 inhibiting furin has been thought to reduce growth of malignant cells or to block infections by preventing essential activation of a pathogen
4400419 however these results suggest that the development of drug interventions could have an unexpected side effect of increasing the risk of developing autoimmune disease
4400420 this distinction puts us one step closer to achieving our vision of being most admired for our recruitment expertise customer service and ability to generate real value for our clients

4400429 we have developed a new vaccine that is extremely safe easy to administer and which rapidly builds protection against hepatitis b infection
4400430 the same vaccine platform has also been shown to elicit significant immune responses in animal studies with influenza anthrax smallpox rsv and hiv plans are under way to begin testing in humans
4400431 patients who lack cellular immunity can build up the needed antibodies to eradicate viral particles in the blood and interstitial fluid but they may not be able to remove infected cells where the virus hides
4400432 this is often the case with chronically infected patients so our vaccine may be of particular benefit to this population of immune compromised individuals
4400433 a possible motive for the killing is beginning to emerge concerning the lifestyle of xi zhou and zhen xing yang
4400434 community intelligence supported by the examination of computer equipment and mobile call data has shown that both of the victims have been involved in fraudulent activity which has angered and upset a number of people

4400441 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4400442 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4400443 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4400444 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4400445 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4400449 you can carry them around squirreled away on your person and bring them out occasionally and sigh or gloat with one love affair of mine that ended i demanded back all my letters they were too good to leave behind he resisted i insisted and got them
4400450 benefited from being taken aside and gently told its not all about you
4400451 the problem with great men is that they do everything including making love and writing love letters looking over their shoulder at posterity
4400452 perhaps the term love letters puts men off its not terribly masculine
4400453 some day when im feeling old and the world is cold i will get a glow just thinking of you and the way you look tonight
4400454 dear sal i love you very much but next time please buy me a train
4400455 sparks furious response from german critics after script posted on internet
4400456 the trouble is that little distinction is made between nazi and german ordinary wehrmacht soldiers or ss officers to the extent that if the script is anything to go by there is no such thing as a good german and all of them have to die the final scene shows hitler trapped in an exploding cinema in paris
4400457 there was speculation last night that tarantino was attempting to upstage tom cruises controversial film valkyrie which tells the true story of the german count who attempted to assassinate adolf hitler the film has been pilloried long before its expected release in february
4400458 there is no such thing as a good german and all of them have to die

4400480 it was a tremendous race and on the last lap i knew that william was going to be a major danger for he took the lead at leathmstown i counterattacked and on the final bend for home i knew i had a major chance i took the inside line and i didnt know what william had done i was too anxious to see that chequered flag
4400481 i thought i had half a chance on the last lap when i was in front but then quick as a flash i was second and going to the line i gave it everything of course i am disappointed to lose but these things happen

4400486 in order to maintain its position on prohibition the government has to show that all drug use is dangerous

4400563 we connected the dots to draw a critical conclusion and found evidence over the amazon that traces the direct path of the effect of human activity on climate change by way of human caused aerosols
4400564 during the dry season in the amazon the only aerosols of any magnitude are from smoke emerging from human initiated fires
4400565 we saw an example of this ourselves increased aerosols over the amazon produced less cloud cover over the atlantic ocean however increased aerosols actually produced more cloud cover
4400566 we wanted to know what the link was between these different outcomes from varying amounts and types of aerosols this paper gives us a clear picture of what is occurring
4400567 this result helps us understand aerosols effect on a clouds mass and lifetime how long it will provide cloud cover how deep the clouds will be and when and where it will rain
4400568 this improved understanding leads to prediction and prediction can help us plan and perhaps prevent some of the potential consequences of putting aerosols from human activity into the atmosphere
4400569 there are new challenges that we face we have the challenge of inflation i know how much each one of you is concerned about the recent rise in prices the inflation we have seen this year is basically due to external factors
4400570 all over the world and in global markets the price of food fuel and other commodities has been rising in many developing countries the rate of inflation is double that in india
4400571 we have taken special measures to insulate the poorer sections of our society from the full impact of rising food and fuel prices our government has not raised the price of kerosene and fertilizers we have not raised the issue price of wheat and rice under pds public distribution system
4400572 we are taking determined measures to bring prices under reasonable control i have urged all chief ministers to improve and strengthen the pds to ensure availability of essential commodities to the common man at reasonable prices the reserve bank of india is moderating the growth of money supply in the country so that inflation can be controlled however while making these efforts we should avoid doing anything which hurts our growth
4400573 the problem of malnutrition is a curse that we must remove our efforts to provide every child with access to education and to improve health care services for all citizens will continue

4400627 if the lord wills we will live and do this or that
4400628 in christ jesus then i have reason to be proud of my work for god for i will not venture to speak of anything except what christ has accomplished through me to bring the gentiles to obedience by word and deed
4400629 those who have never been told of him will see and those who have never heard will understand
4400630 in christ jesus then i have reason to be proud of my work for god
4400631 therefore in christ jesus i have found reason for boasting in things pertaining to god
4400632 for i am already being poured out as a drink offering and the time of my departure has come i have fought the good fight i have finished the race i have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge will award to me on that day and not only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing
4400633 for consider your calling brothers not many of you were wise according to worldly standards not many were powerful not many were of noble birth
4400634 for i will not venture to speak of anything except what christ has accomplished through me to bring the gentiles to obedience
4400635 you know when god doesnt show up and gods not moving thank god i have a gift and thank god i move by faith and when gods not moving i move god
4400636 for i will not venture to speak of anything except what christ has accomplished through me to bring the gentiles to obedience
4400637 by the power of signs and wonders by the power of the spirit of god
4400638 how do we know that this message you preach is true
4400639 so that from jerusalem and all the way around to illyricum i have fulfilled the ministry of the gospel of christ
4400640 and thus i make it my ambition to preach the gospel not where christ has already been named lest i build on someone elses foundation but as it is written those who have never been told of him will see and those who have never heard will understand
4400641 only one life will soon be past only whats done for christ will last
4400642 one step forward in obedience is worth years of study about it
4400643 these men who have turned the world upside down have come here also
4400644 and this is the confidence that we have toward him that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us and if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask we know that we have the requests that we have asked of him
4400645 the strong are those who have laid hold of the great faith they have fully grasped the wondrous things that christ has done for the world which paul has been revealing in the book of romans they are the men who have entered completely into the rest of jesus christ they know that justification is apart from works they have realized that liberty christ has given us and are done with the rules of legalism and ceremonialism forever they are strong in the sense of comprehending the meaning of the christian faith
4400646 who are you to pass judgment on the servant of another it is before his own master that he stands or falls and he will be upheld for the lord is able to make him stand
4400647 look both men can live in harmony with their differing opinions but whatever either one decides he should be fully convinced in his own mind
4400648 the one who observes the day observes it in honor of the lord the one who eats eats in honor of the lord since he gives thanks to god while the one who abstains abstains in honor of the lord and gives thanks to god
4400649 for none of us lives to himself and none of us dies to himself 8 for if we live we live to the lord and if we die we die to the lord so then whether we live or whether we die we are the lords 9 for to this end christ died and lived again that he might be lord both of the dead and of the living
4400650 why do you pass judgment on your brother or you why do you despise your brother for we will all stand before the judgment seat of god 11 for it is written as i live says the lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to god
4400651 the lord may counteract your action and save your injured brother from himself and you but your action is none the less calculated for his perdition and all the while this soul for which in comparison with your dull and narrow liberty you care so little was so much cared for by the lord that he died for it
4400652 by insisting on your liberty at the expense of your brother causing him to be destroyed and defeated your liberty while perfectly okay will now be seen as evil
4400653 so then let us pursue what makes for peace and for mutual building 20 do not for the sake of food destroy the work of god everything is indeed clean but it is wrong for anyone to make another stumble by what he eats 21 it is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble
4400654 but whoever has doubts is condemned if he eats because the eating is not from faith for whatever does not proceed from faith is sin
4400655 whatever thought word action etc does not spring from an inner conviction that is in harmony with a persons faith in god is sin
4400656 besides this you know the time that the hour has come for you to wake from sleep for salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed the night is far gone the day is at hand so then let us cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light let us walk properly as in the daytime not in orgies and drunkenness not in sexual immorality and sensuality not in quarreling and jealousy but put on the lord jesus christ and make no provision for the flesh to gratify its desires
4400657 in view of gods mercy present your bodies a living sacrifice allow yourselves to be transformed by the renewing of your mind and live like this be humble serve love forgive submit and love some more do this remembering the great mercy of god but also dont forget the time
4400658 salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed
4400659 work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is god who works in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure
4400660 for i consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us for the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of god for the creation was subjected to futility not willingly but because of him who subjected it in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of god for we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now and not only the creation but we ourselves who have the firstfruits of the spirit groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons the redemption of our bodies for in this hope we were saved now hope that is seen is not hope for who hopes for what he sees but if we hope for what we do not see we wait for it with patience
4400661 and who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this
4400662 do not be conformed to this age this time because this is not your time this is night time but your time is at hand the sun is rising over the horizon
4400663 the hour has come for you to wake from sleep for salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed the night is far gone the day is at hand
4400664 now concerning the times and the seasons brothers you have no need to have anything written to you
4400665 for you are all children of light children of the day we are not of the night or of the darkness so then let us not sleep as others do but let us keep awake and be sober for those who sleep sleep at night and those who get drunk are drunk at night but since we belong to the day let us be sober having put on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation
4400666 let us cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light 13 let us walk properly as in the daytime not in orgies and drunkenness not in sexual immorality and sensuality not in quarreling and jealousy
4400667 cast it off because you dont want to be wearing that clothing when christ returns
4400668 put on the lord jesus christ and make no provision for the flesh to gratify its desires
4400669 having accepted christ and having been baptized believers should now not rest on their laurels but should continue in practice what they have done in principle
4400670 okay i am putting on christ now all the while holding fast to the things of the world
4400671 it is not for you to know times or seasons that the father has fixed by his own authority
4400672 so we are always of good courage we know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the lord for we walk by faith not by sight yes we are of good courage and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the lord so whether we are at home or away we make it our aim to please him for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body whether good or evil

4400674 you shall not commit adultery you shall not murder you shall not steal you shall not covet
4400675 owe no one anything except to love each other now consider for a moment what this means
4400676 i have offered the respect and honor that was due him or her
4400677 for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law
4400678 you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind 38this is the great and first commandment and a second is like it you shall love your neighbor as yourself on these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets
4400679 if you want to know what i expect of you here you go love me with all your heart soul mind strength do this by keeping me first not worshipping idols not profaning my name and keeping the sabbath
4400680 if i can only do a little better i think i can make it
4400681 and behold a lawyer stood up to put him to the test saying
4400682 what is written in the law how do you read it
4400683 you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind and your neighbor as yourself
4400684 you have answered correctly do this and you will live
4400685 what then are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace by no means do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves you are slaves of the one whom you obey either of sin which leads to death or of obedience which leads to righteousness but thanks be to god that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed and having been set free from sin have become slaves of righteousness i am speaking in human terms because of your natural limitations for just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification when you were slaves of sin you were free in regard to righteousness but what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed the end of those things is death but now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of god the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end eternal life for the wages of sin is death but the free gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord
4400686 remember that the standard you once tried so hard to obey those commands you once tried so hard to keep but never could

4400691 let every person be subject to the governing authorities for there is no authority except from god and those that exist have been instituted by god therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what god has appointed and those who resist will incur judgment for rulers are not a terror to good conduct but to bad would you have no fear of the one who is in authority then do what is good and you will receive his approval for he is gods servant for your good but if you do wrong be afraid for he does not bear the sword in vain for he is the servant of god an avenger who carries out gods wrath on the wrongdoer therefore one must be in subjection not only to avoid gods wrath but also for the sake of conscience 6for because of this you also pay taxes for the authorities are ministers of god attending to this very thing pay to all what is owed to them taxes to whom taxes are owed revenue to whom revenue is owed respect to whom respect is owed honor to whom honor is owed
4400692 when you come to the land that the lord your god is giving you and you possess it and dwell in it and then say i will set a king over me like all the nations that are around me you may indeed set a king over you whom the lord your god will choose one from among your brothers you shall set as king over you you may not put a foreigner over you who is not your brother
4400693 no ruler can hold his place except by permission of the god of heaven and in that sense every power that exists is of god
4400694 submit yourself to the governing institution and dont try to deinstitute it because i am the one who instituted it
4400695 whoever resists the authorities resists what god has appointed and those who resist will incur judgment
4400696 be afraid for he does not bear the sword in vain
4400697 therefore one must be in subjection not only to avoid gods wrath but also for the sake of conscience
4400698 and when they had brought them they set them before the council
4400699 we strictly charged you not to teach in this name yet here you have filled jerusalem with your teaching and you intend to bring this mans blood upon us

4400710 repay no one evil for evil but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all
4400711 for while we were still weak at the right time christ died for the ungodly for one will scarcely die for a righteous person though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die but god shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners christ died for us since therefore we have now been justified by his blood much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of god for if while we were enemies we were reconciled to god by the death of his son much more now that we are reconciled shall we be saved by his life
4400712 but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all

4400717 every person on the face of the earth will give an account to me every wrong will be accounted for justice will be served every evil deed a person commits will be accounted for and punished not a single one will escape the judgment and wrath of god the sin and evil of every man woman and child will be dealt with for believers the judgment and wrath of god has been poured out upon jesus christ who died in our place taking the full punishment for our sin and our evil sin upon himself so that we might go free the unbeliever however will personally face the judgment and wrath of god for his sin and evil this is the wrath spoken of in verse 18 this wrath is so terrible and so unimaginable that no amount of harm we inflict out of our own personal vengeance can compare to it dont worry about making sure everyone gets what is coming to them thats gods business
4400718 god i know what you said but i just dont believe you will follow through so i am going to make sure it gets done
4400719 so whatever you wish that others would do to you do also to them

4400780 it appears that for people who have a certain genetic makeup the initial physical reaction to smoking can play a significant role in determining what happens next
4400781 if cigarette smoking is sustained nicotine addiction can occur in a few days to a few months the finding of a genetic association with pleasurable early smoking experiences may also help explain how people get addicted and keep smoking the rest of their lives
4400782 further observational studies are needed to confirm these findings and establish the mechanisms underlying these observations

4400787 the screen is the message and therefore the concept of the screen is aparamount in theortical considerations of cinema it is the final stage on which occur the graphic bombardments of the cinematic illusion and in the context the notion of the cinema becomes secondary the most important principle in attaing a higher level of expression is that the group of images so organized should generate more meaning than the sum of the information contained in each shot

4400792 editing is the selection and ordering of shots to create a narrative structure that communicates ideas feelings or attitudes out of this chaotic mass of images the filmmaker with either a stationary of moving camera captures shorts selectively framing them in a variety of graphic compositions and assigns them each a given time on the screen the evolution of a cinema syntax made possible increasingly complex combinations of shots which could then generate an even greater variety of messages and meanings
4400793 considering the pain in other parts of the country the bay area has weathered the current recession well but with the planned layoffs especially among our largest employers we may yet suffer collateral damage
4400794 despite the general pessimism we are very pleased to see that silicon valley and smaller companies throughout the region are still strong and even hiring
4400795 the survey reveals the mood of bay area executives has turned with many preparing for a long downturn
4400796 the triple strike of rising energy and commodity prices real estate problems and the state budget crisis are signaling a hold for hiring plans the bright spot remains silicon valley which is benefitting from export growth and booming asian economies

4400834 now that we have left universal we can really be ourselves and i think that comes across in the new album
4400835 before we were tied down and everything was a bit hectic with deadlines that needed to be met
4400836 every little thing we did was analysed and if we wanted to change a line in a song then a meeting was arranged and everyone argued

4400867 we are committed to having the most respected brand with the highest quality content available on any platform and this achievement affirms that discovery channel is a trusted source of entertainment in south africa
4400868 we place significant importance on the south african market and these results underscore that the compelling original programming we offer is resonating strongly with consumers in the market
4400869 for consumers trust is at the very heart of their relationship with a brand it is the one key ingredient that keeps them coming back for more bearing in mind that there are many hundreds of brands competing within the 19 category spread to be in the top 10 having received a high trust endorsement from over 70 of those nominating the brand is a testimony to outstanding brand management while to be first is an honour which brings with it a responsibility to maintain this performance in the future
4400870 is pushing boundaries with over 200 new series and specials commissioned globally for the 2008 2009 season
4400871 global trends are moving towards advertising online rather than traditional media
4400872 it just makes sense in south africa the number of cell phone users far outweighs the number of internet connections so no company can afford not to take advantage of this opportunity
4400873 what makes this platform so unique is the fact that customers can choose to download the software and view the advertising
4400874 as the eyeballs paybacks accumulate they can either have automatic loading of airtime as they reach a certain total or they can choose to be sent a pin on request free airtime can also then be transferred to a sibling child or anyone else they choose
4400875 we also believe that our customers should be rewarded for telling their friends about us our invite a friend program will allow our users to receive additional eyeballs paybacks for those friends they have referred to us
4400876 eyeballs mobile allows advertisers to determine exactly which customers they would like to target with their advertisements and our metrics allow us to report on the exact profile of the people who have viewed the advertisements
4400877 this will minimise wastage and assist in customising advertising messages for specific target audiences
4400878 as a user you get the choice to download the software view the advertisements and collect rewards or not
4400879 and while we believe the combination of rich content and rewards will be reason enough for our customers to use this platform there will be random cash prizes up for grabs during the launch month
4400880 a woman needs money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction
4400881 intensified international pressures on iran have negatively affected economic activity
4400882 looking forward it is crucial to slow domestic demand growth in order to lower inflation while stepping up structural reforms to increase the economys growth potential and employment creation
4400883 there has been no political consensus to implement other imf recommendations such as tightening monetary policy and reducing government interference in resource allocation
4400884 weve been fighting very hard day and night for four days but after today the water level should recede

4400889 twenty five meters is not enough for people to remember how we suffered in the war
4400890 if people think about the past we couldnt have wars

4400892 we are travelling to south africa with president robert mugabe today as the negotiations continue
4400893 the talks never collapsed and all parties are committed to the dialogue i would also want to confirm commitment to see the talks end successfully sooner rather than later
4400894 they say rangers have not had much money until now but i find that hard to understand because they get 50 000 people every other week
4400895 we are being obliged to contemplate transfers of 6million 8million so it seems strange a club of that stature can only afford what they have offered us
4400896 i would be disappointed if the club allowed him to go for a sum that is below his worth
4400897 i suppose the risk exists still that because he is not one of the starting four rangers will come in with a bid that the club finds acceptable he would desperately want to go and i would be in a difficult situation

4400900 senator mccain and the republicans mock democratic candidate for president barack obama for suggesting that the country conserve gas through proper tire inflation
4400901 the russian president has said that their military operations have halted we would hope that he would be true to his word and that those operations will halt and we will work very hard to see if we can bring an end to this crisis
4400902 it is long overdue too many innocent people have died
4400903 we have finally got understanding of our point of view that poland being a crucial partner in nato and an important friend and ally of the united states must also be safe
4400904 my interpretation is this was probably the result of poor information given to the athlete who did not have the knowledge of what to avoid and what she was allowed to take
4400905 my interpretation is that this a feature of increased awareness in the sports world that doping is unacceptable and you dont compete in the olympic games if you are doped
4400906 the first thing i had to do was try and stay calm and not yell what are you thinking
4400907 this wasnt about the girl developing hair early it was the mothers obsession with wanting her daughter to be a supermodel
4400908 some kids do have a lot of hair a 10 year old with a dark mustache is going to feel self conscious and is going to ask for waxing
4400909 its not uncommon for girls to get their period at 9 or 10 years old and with that development comes increased hair growth
4400910 the waxing itself is not an issue the bigger issue is whether they are encouraged to engage in risky behaviors
4400911 virgin hair can be waxed so successfully that growth can be permanently stopped in just 2 to 6 sessions save your child a lifetime of waxing and put the money in the bank for her college education instead
4400912 while im doing the childs eyebrows a mother will stand behind me and say look at those blackheads you need to have a facial you need to go on accutane
4400913 i had a mother who brought her daughter in pulled up her shirt and asked us to wax the girls back the hair didnt seem to be bothering the little girl but the mom was embarrassed and wanted it done
4400914 i told the mom to wait until the child wanted it but she refused
4400915 she feels more confident and other kids dont make fun of her anymore she gets compliments on how she looks now
4400916 girls are learning the worst possible lessons about body image and body hair
4400917 keep your bodies like little girls because thats what men like
4400918 let them know that hair is normal despite the images that they see and hear what you daughter has to say this should be a give and take conversation
4400919 the prime minister never offered to absorb 20 000 refugees in israel the prime minister again reiterates that under any future agreement there will not be any return of palestinian refugees to israel in any number
4400920 god bless you my sons you saved so many lives
4400921 stupid by killing civilians you will never go to paradise
4400922 we have seen a 75 percent increase in calls to our hotline since the start of advertising the number through kaka nijat this year
4400923 people usually call to inform police about explosions and suicide bombings
4400924 we are trying to encourage the people to help the security forces in the fight against terrorists who are using islam as a tool for their purposes
4400925 he teaches us how to call police when we see bad people
4400926 since watching kaka nijat now we know the police number we know how the suicide bombers look how they dress
4400927 it is the most effective weapon used by the insurgents in terms of inflicting casualties
4400928 even in their absence the court believes it has authority to proceed with the case
4400929 i am satisfied that the history given by jatinder to the ambulance officers and to doctors of the consumption of 16 panadol tablets was not true
4400930 i also accept expert evidence that the amount consumed must have been well in excess of that disclosed
4400931 my wife was very friendly a good lady i still miss her
4400932 she did not suicide at all she was a very happy lady she wasnt upset at all even the day before
4400933 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4400934 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is pedaling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4400935 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4400936 im putting this question forward im putting the evidence forward voters can make up their own minds
4400937 its certainly not ideal conditions for them to be in
4400938 we dont know what equipment they have whether anyone is injured we dont even know whether the signal being put out is coming from these climbers or another group or individual
4400939 we had a brief break in the weather earlier today which allowed us to hone in on the beacon but it closed in again soon after and the rescuers had to turn back
4400940 we now have a general idea where the signal is coming from and that will hasten the process tomorrow but with something like this the signal pings off all the mountains and it takes a bit of time to triangulate the location
4400941 stands ready to provide consular assistance to any australians in need
4400942 there are a number of groups climbing including a group of six australians so at this stage it is not clear which party triggered the rescue beacon
4400943 it may be that we dont get in to have a look for them until tomorrow
4400944 we have search and rescue teams on standby but there is always an avalanche risk
4400945 there are a number of groups climbing including a group of six australians so at this stage it is not clear which party triggered the rescue beacon
4400946 i ask for the families forgiveness and prayers and i will pray for your families and loved ones
4400947 does your mind ever think about anything else mine wont
4400948 whether you can even have a criminal prosecution for something that the government itself sets up
4400949 i knew all along that for us to spurt we needed to play better on the road
4400950 we needed to put more runs on the board and thats exactly what we have done
4400951 yeah it feels good to accomplish something but you can tell by the atmosphere in the clubhouse its pretty numb in here
4400952 im not happy obviously your expectations are high what i was worried about in my two rehab stars it came to fruition i was worried about how sharp i really was and how much i was able to do what i wanted to do
4400953 against a lesser lineup maybe i get away with some of that stuff
4400954 i definitely would have been upset if i had been thrown out of the game
4400955 i was thrown out of one here last year for no good reason
4400956 i tried to avoid the tag i tried to slide away from him i couldnt breathe it knocked the air out of me
4400957 minutes after i passed the resting spot i heard a big explosion i turned my head and saw big flames
4400958 we rushed to the scene and saw charred bodies while wounded people were crying for help pots and burned prayer rugs were scattered all over the place
4400959 its difficult to dig up the past and go into it unless we are being seriously inconvenienced by the hurt the thing is when we are carrying the burden of our unprocessed pain sooner or later it will inconvenience us
4400960 they have stepped up to the plate and their partnership is why we are able to take over the mission that the georgians had to leave behind with no change in the security and safety of the iraqi people

4400963 i am satisfied that the history given by jatinder to the ambulance officers and to doctors of the consumption of 16 panadol tablets was not true
4400964 i also accept expert evidence that the amount consumed must have been well in excess of that disclosed
4400965 my wife was very friendly a good lady i still miss her
4400966 she did not suicide at all she was a very happy lady she wasnt upset at all even the day before
4400967 he was the most kind soft spoken man very polite
4400968 he made his bed put his clothes on a hanger he was a career military man spit and polish to the end
4400969 it does concern me that not only in missouri but apparently other states this is the person they turn to
4400970 it does illustrate how difficult it is to find doctors willing to do this
4400971 i assure them ive taken care of everything so that nothing will go wrong i help them calmly go through the procedure
4400972 it will have the same effect the guy will die
4400973 my life was a convoluded mess of fear and uncertanty i became a very confused and very angry young teen
4400974 i really never was what you could call a social drinker i had my fun dont get me wrong but i was pretty much using the alcohol and the drugs to numb the pain inside
4400975 if something upset me or didnt go the way i had hoped i would drink or drug at it
4400976 i loved the excitement but the cost was getting to be heavy
4400977 my life was quickly unraveling and i was solidly on a path of self destruction
4400978 i was hoping that the change would cure my problems
4400979 i like to say when you stick a jack ass in a crate and ship it to california that same jack ass gets out of the crate in california
4400980 i really couldnt figure life out i knew something had to change or i was going to die
4400981 i kept trying to fill the empty hole inside of me with whatever i could drink or take and nothing was working
4400982 i love my life today the empty hole is gone
4400983 when my daughter was born as she reached the age of 18 months i realized what a wonderful bond exists at that age between mother and child
4400984 writing the story as helped me to put this chapter of my life in perspective it has really been healing
4400985 i have so much to be greatful for in my life
4400986 not every day is perfect but my worst days today cant even compare with where i was in that fog of my life
4400987 i love to write particularly about my home on nantucket i hope to write other stories about nantucket and the cape cod area as well

4401006 ets europe was selected due to the strength of their worldwide experience in delivering large scale assessments
4401007 it is disappointing that the issues with this years national curriculum test results have meant that the partnership between qca and ets europe must end early
4401008 ets europe has apologised to schools for the delays in marking national curriculum assessments in england as a subsidiary of a global non profit company we are dedicated to assuring quality and equity for all pupils and we are sorry that the results this summer were delayed for some schools
4401009 however we would argue that the quality of the marking is high due to the stringent new checks that we introduced this year
4401010 i think his last year is going to be an emotional thing for our seniors and for him senior quarterback curtis painter said
4401011 hes been a guy thats really been honest with me since i got here painter said
4401012 when youve got that kind of coach you really play for him he trusts you and hes given his honest opinion so you want to give your honest effort
4401013 senior year is to be memorable painter the subject of purdues first heisman trophy campaign since kyle orton in 2004 holds the keys
4401014 those types of end of the year awards will come he said
4401015 im not too worried about that im worried about purdue football and this first game and getting rolling with the season
4401016 theyre going to be missed but weve got a great group of guys behind them guys who can make plays and be effective
4401017 i really dont look at it as a lot of pressure orton said
4401018 ive been working hard for it its something that i definitely want and im ready for it im ready for it to happen
4401019 theyre explosive athletes explosive guys with the ball that really any play has the capability of busting a big one painter said
4401020 were going to be as good as we play together heygood said
4401021 we dont really have any marquee players on our defense we just have to work well as a unit
4401022 its good to have a strong non conference schedule because it checks how good your team is he said
4401023 we know our big ten schedule is going to be tough every year and to have a couple of real tough games before the big ten its good to measure how good our team can be with how well we play against good competition
4401024 we won a game in the end we won a game in the two minute offense painter said
4401025 we hadnt won a lot of close games in the past so to get that going into the offseason was a big thing people are excited and i think thats a direct result of the game
4401026 slowing commodity prices could stabilise the market but are not a trigger for a sharp move up
4401027 as for the weakness of the euro it needs a bit of time to reflect in company balance sheets over the next weeks and months company comments may get more positive
4401028 i think you can expect to see us gold medal competitive in about eight events which is phenomenal
4401029 and because of the previous performances at the world championships we are odds on favourite and whichever way you look at it you cant avoid that
4401030 its a combination of money the right people the best equipment and just a very positive mentality
4401031 we know its going to be a tough game for us therell be no frills about dagenham theyll get the ball forward as quickly as they can so we have to compete we have to battle with them
4401032 i accuse the government of russia of a deliberate policy of ethnic cleansing
4401033 weve received 14 000 reports of brutal attacks slaughter rapes and internment of people in violation of the rules of the geneva convention and international humanitarian law
4401034 punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west
4401035 we are still in the negotiating process russians are trying to justify their invasion and to legalise their presence in georgia
4401036 i think we should take a closer look at it the peace agreement
4401037 we can forget about talks on georgias territorial integrity because its impossible to force south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be returned into georgias fold by force
4401038 there are things that people eat in this country that it would not occur to any of the rest of us to eat
4401039 i have to commend the chinese team good kids nothing to say about it
4401040 too bad they are underaged and they shouldnt be legally accepted
4401041 i think the whole thing is more of symbolic importance
4401042 its establishing a presence showing the flag and challenging the expansion of russian power in that country
4401043 the united states government then will turn to questions of both economic reconstruction and also what to do to help the georgian security forces looking to the longer term future
4401044 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west economically and politically and in security arrangements
4401045 i think that the russians further message was to all of the parts of the former soviet union as a signal about trying to integrate with the west and move outside of the longtime russian sphere of influence
4401046 we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces
4401047 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia
4401048 re examine the entire gamut of our military to military activities and will make changes as necessary and appropriate depending on russian actions in the days ahead
4401049 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come

4401052 8 years after the end of the war on the gla
4401053 it is very unsettling to us that chinese troops have remained in europe and expanded their base facilities reconstruction is complete and there have been no terrorist attacks in years yet china continues to amass more and more troops these actions raise questions about the long term motives of beijing and whether or not america and china are capable of maintaining friendly relations
4401054 the security council is the domain of the worlds great nations america is no longer great therefore it no longer deserves a seat

4401057 it set into motion a dynamic in the arab world where much of the arab street believes that hezbollah won that war and there is tremendous expectation on hezbollah to continue the struggle
4401058 we destroyed all of hezbollahs infrastructure much of its civilian headquarters we killed about a quarter of their fighters that is a prohibitive number of casualties for any modern fighting force and yet perception is everything in the middle east and the perception was in the arab world at least that israel was bested in that conflict
4401059 israel would then have to reply into lebanon possibly drawing in the syrians and ultimately the iranians

4401065 ik volg zijn besluit maar met pijn in mijn hart
4401066 de wijnand van nu is een heel andere dan die van toen
4401067 i chose this song because i feel it is very appropriate to the event because it is a worldwide event and we are all in the circle of life
4401068 but i enjoyed it very much and it was very popular with the norwegian audience because they are very religious
4401069 i wanted to have something for everyone and i think this was warmly received
4401070 to close the event we finished with a collaboration of musical songs on the large open air main stage in front of a crowd of more than a thousand people perhaps more i didnt really have time to count
4401071 i used to sing around the house but i wouldnt let anybody hear me
4401072 mum was really surprised when i phoned up for singing lessons
4401073 they come and choose what they like and once you get an agent thats when you start getting jobs
4401074 the online id is invalid try using a different one
4401075 once we got control of the game we forced the issue a lot more but it took a while i was impressed with fort they had some good players themselves
4401076 we were lucky in that in certain areas of the park we got the better of them our pace down the flank with leighton flaws james john ston getting control on the ball and some of his passes were superb
4401077 the boys are understandably ecstatic you always think this one might have been a banana skin you hear so much about them taking beatings and heavy beatings in the past but i thought they had some good players beaten by class though i thought
4401078 i think if we play to our cap abilities id be very disappointed if we cant give them anything other than a very tough game
4401079 i felt the whole team played well everybody stepped up today seemed to come of age as they say i suppose
4401080 fort william are a good side 90 minutes of battling but we played the way we have been playing even when we changed formation in the second half after injuries things just worked out the way we wanted
4401081 ive been keeping in touch with a couple of the boys i know at cove rangers and im delighted im going back to allan park hopefully a lot of people will come down from shetland because its not much of a journey hopefully a good few will turn up and fill allan park a bit itll be good to se a lot of old faces
4401082 it was a complete unknown here you just dont know what youll line up against okay you can be up against a team thats finished bottom of the league but it counts for nothing when we are coming so far i didnt know what to expect but we set a standard for ourselves and played well
4401083 a few of us have decent experience playing at a good level
4401084 im over the moon with cove being our next assignment there is a real buzz in shetland people want to come down and watch us play because five years ago the only real action people could see were the games with orkney now were playing more matches and people want to get behind us
4401085 make no bones about it if we are to be successful in this competition we will have to overcome teams who are a step up in class from the standard of the island games teams like cove rangers deveronvale keith inverurie locos and huntly are all semi professional outfits pay their best players 10 000 plus and play and compete with scottish league sides on a regular basis in the scottish cup every year

4401090 concerned that this process may not be capable of providing adequate protection against hazards that will only come to light once the spacecraft is in operation
4401091 that has made some folks uncomfortable but guess what were not done yet
4401092 if we tried to please everybody the spacecraft would not get off the ground
4401093 the funding over the next two years became too tight for us so i had to adjust the schedule for that
4401094 he suffered that punishment very early on while the rest of these individuals proceeded to pursue their goals
4401095 i believe the only transportation available will be a mo ped for them
4401096 i want to keep playing i know people say that the past is the past and that something like last year cant happen again
4401097 it felt great i hope to pitch sunday at washington
4401098 thats why i work so hard in the offseason to feel good right now
4401099 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
4401100 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
4401101 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
4401102 how is it you were totally incapacitated for those five days
4401103 can you explain how passengers or the captain were not aware of that
4401104 your statements and appearances in the media have been instruments in creating fear anxiety and segregation in a community where citizens should be living in peace and harmony with each other
4401105 the hispanic community will continue to have a voice in the carcieri administration
4401106 we believe this is causing a stigma around the immigrant population and we dont want to be part of it
4401107 we all basically felt the same feeling but we wanted to continue working because we feel like our people need representation
4401108 nicole saw that even a clean blanket was out of reach for some of these new moms so she wanted to figure out an efficient way to connect them with companies and individuals who want to help
4401109 we take for granted the basic necessities for some families its a serious struggle
4401110 this is one way to ease the financial burden and help new babies have a good start in life we are only working with companies and products that joel and i would use were checking every product out for safety and all products are bpa free
4401111 you cant understand how a woman seeing a man who has been separated from his wife rosetta getty for months can cause such a scandal
4401112 its awful i cant tell you you wonder when its all going to stop
4401113 any implication otherwise is an absolute lie balthazars affair has been utterly devastating to rosetta and her family
4401114 yes theyre living separate lives at the moment because of his shenanigans
4401115 its disappointing that getty and miller are flaunting this so publicly there are four children involved their oldest cassius is mature enough to understand somethings not right
4401116 would you allow one of our people to come down and verify the body
4401117 the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body was the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi
4401118 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4401119 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4401120 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4401121 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4401122 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4401123 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4401124 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4401125 there is no reason why fares should go up as a result of this for the consumer it means they will have access to a much bigger network we will coordinate our schedules to make it easier to connect between airlines and you will have greater access to cheaper fares
4401126 there will be nothing to stop the customer from taking a fare with aa outbound and taking a fare with ba on the inbound leg
4401127 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the uk and us aviation industry
4401128 this is an open market and that is the big difference between now and 2001 anybody can come in and compete
4401129 we have seen open skies and we have seen the effects
4401130 the other two alliances have anti trust immunity the issue of competition between the alliances is much more relevant than it was in 2001 and we have a changed industry environment things have changed sufficiently for us to apply with confidence this time
4401131 the reason for this is that we must put our countrys interest first the girl appearing on the picture must be flawless in terms of her facial expression and the great feeling she can give to people
4401132 na jesse owens paavo nurmi en carl lewis is er nu phelps en dat hebben we nodig
4401133 regarding indonesias 63rd anniversary of independence 385 prisoners in kerobokan prison will receive a sentence reduction or remission
4401134 from that number 42 people will immediately be released because their service period is over
4401135 among the prisoners to get remission there are seven foreign citizens including schapelle corby and renae lawrence
4401136 but it is still only a recommendation the official announcement will be on august 17
4401137 he pasado toda la noche en gori la ciudad es patrullada por las fuerzas de ocupaci n rusas la situaci n es de calma
4401138 los rusos prometieron que hoy permitir n el paso de ayuda humanitaria
4401139 we have a long standing history with the norwegian kings guard and it is something we are extremely proud of
4401140 its an honour that they take the time to visit us and we are all looking forward to welcoming them on friday
4401141 edinburgh zoo is famous for its king penguins and nils olav is definitely the most famous of them all
4401142 nils always recognises the norwegian guardsmen when they come to visit him
4401143 he loves the attention he receives at the ceremony and takes his time inspecting the troops
4401144 were all very excited about his new promotion and weve all been wondering what it could be
4401145 i think the best way to say this is that it will be uncomfortably close to us come monday morning
4401146 as far as being able to go out and do the things he wants to do hes been able to do that
4401147 thats so much better than a number on a scale
4401148 last i heard he can still ride a bike as opposed to being a week or 10 days from dying
4401149 i notice that stress eating is something i do well
4401150 whatevers in the refrigerator is what gets put in the tank
4401151 instead of portioning the chips out of the sack and then putting the sack clear in the other room thats one of the things he has a little problem with
4401152 its either curl up in the corner and cry or keep it light and try to get through it
4401153 i could be pretty upset pretty easily but why should i be everything would get worse my health would start going downhill theres no profit in it
4401154 so you might as well say your prayers talk to the lord and let him handle it and do your best to get through it until he does thats what i do
4401155 people may be going through a break up or they are suffering depression they may be vulnerable to these sorts of things she said
4401156 the evidence is that credit card default is related to unemployment illness and family breakdown not bank marketing he said in a statement
4401157 the australian bankers association does not believe that there is a sound argument for credit card limit offers to be banned by government regulation
4401158 we found that lenders frame their letters in various ways to make it more likely customers will not really think too hard about taking on more debt and just accept the limit increase he said
4401159 the letters trigger the natural human instinct to trust experts in this case experts who have already determined you can afford a limit increase
4401160 we are trying to keep optimistic but it is difficult to stay calm
4401161 not only military targets are being destroyed but public roads and buildings and civilians are being killed
4401162 over the past few weeks and months we have been working hard to prepare a project to distribute scripture booklets to people living in south ossetia
4401163 all the agreements and arrangements were finally in place to make god s word available there
4401164 we ask for prayers that a willingness to find peace will take root in all peoples hearts please pray opposing sides are reconciled and that mutual forgiveness and acceptance is exercised
4401165 we mourn the death of soldiers children men women and elderly people from both sides
4401166 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4401167 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4401168 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4401169 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4401170 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4401171 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4401172 he pasado toda la noche en gori la ciudad es patrullada por las fuerzas de ocupaci n rusas la situaci n es de calma
4401173 los rusos prometieron que hoy permitir n el paso de ayuda humanitaria
4401174 hasta que salgan las pruebas de adn el que me viol anda suelto
4401175 hasta que salgan las pruebas de adn el que me viol anda suelto
4401176 very soon mud is planning to begin full scale operation of high powered wells in its massive new platte west well field located in western douglas county
4401177 if mud begins full operation at this time it will place the drinking water of the omaha area at risk
4401178 we now know the threat is not actually contained and it is clear the corps doesnt know how far east the contamination extends
4401179 in light of this it is far too risky for mud to operate its massive new well field at this time
4401180 the permit issued to mud by the corps in 2003 acknowledges that the pumping could cause the contamination to move and get into the drinking water
4401181 instead of instructing mud to delay operations until the toxins are contained they are allowing mud to proceed
4401182 theyll let us know if there are any problems and if there are they will be corrected
4401183 it is very troubling that the corps continues to refuse to test all the residential wells in the vicinity of the eastern plume
4401184 the public does not have a network of monitoring wells that could serve as an effective early warning system to alert them when muds pumping draws the contamination farther east
4401185 neither the state nor the epa has conducted a study of the effect of muds maximum pumping reported to be at 160 million gallons per day when the stream flow in the platte river is low
4401186 neither have they conducted any independent groundwater modeling related to the mead superfund site toxins
4401187 hasta que salgan las pruebas de adn el que me viol anda suelto
4401188 i am convinced that honouring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4401189 although im not sure anything will make some of them feel better
4401190 urgent development services would remain undelivered in the short term
4401191 peoples confidence in the ability of the international forces and afghan security forces to provide security is weakening and their confidence in the ability of both their own government and the international communitys ability to deliver on the development promises is weakening
4401192 n o existe outra vari vel de tanta import ncia para os ecossistemas mar timos litor neos que tenha mudado t o drasticamente e em um lapso t o curto
4401193 as zonas mortas eram raras agora s o comuns cada vez h mais em mais lugares
4401194 this is good news said maria lahood of the new york based center for constitutional rights lawyer who represents arar
4401195 we are getting another shot and certainly the court thinks mistakes were made in the original ruling
4401196 this means maher may finally get justice in this country
4401197 this decision indicates the court is at least interested in investigating it further she said
4401198 whoever initiated this had very strong views on the matter
4401199 i wouldnt say it was probable but if i was his lawyer i would be excited she said
4401200 sending him to canada could have posed a threat to our country mukasey said
4401201 canadas housing market is running into some seriously foul weather amid the weakest affordability in nearly two decades
4401202 while we still doubt that canada will stage an instant replay of the trauma in u s markets even a mild version would be bad news
4401203 we opined a month ago that given the steep run up in new listings double digit sales declines and the sharp drop in consumer sentiment price declines may become a more common feature across the country in the months ahead these latest figures simply pound home that point
4401204 for us we honestly believe there are enough young professionals that want to be within five 10 minutes of downtown
4401205 said hicks who has owned the house for more than a year
4401206 so we are optimistic but having said that we need to have the right buyer
4401207 we know what we could have got last year but we were a little bit unfamiliar with what happened with the housing prices until just now
4401208 we are so even with china in the last three years
4401209 this is one where we knew it was going to have to take an a game certainly emotionally and mentally im very proud of the girls doing that the leadership in the circle with bay and behind the plate with catcher erin cumpstone was huge
4401210 shes an olympian thats the type of response you expect she delivered the pitches so that we could one touch of the ball out thats a veteran for you
4401211 the principal investigators incorporated this project into their personal research programs
4401212 its being done a bit as a spinoff from our research funding
4401213 the main proposal that we wrote didnt get funded so whats happening is that bits and pieces are going ahead
4401214 his bosses didnt really understand the importance of this after a while they slowly grasped its importance
4401215 honestly it happened very slowly because with the government it gets very political this kind of thing there were a lot of american business people and agencies that wanted to do the same research and robert always turned them down because he wanted it to have some canadian content
4401216 theres certainly more of a wild west atmosphere here than there will ever be in vancouver
4401217 i havent walked through a mall yet where i havent seen multiple store windows that are doing things that would hit a sponsors radar and raise concern
4401218 we look under the pillows and look under the sofas
4401219 we masked the name of the other company as best we could in these cases you try to be reasonable but you often have to use tape it happens quite a bit
4401220 when i walk through a venue now its such a different thing if im with my wife she comments on the architecture and i comment on the brand of the security system
4401221 you have a lot of pre existing advertising at these places that will have to be covered up for the olympics bocog beijings organizing committee doesnt have that problem
4401222 the tv cameras might pan to a prominent reporter during an event or a press conference so if that might put a big backlit apple logo in the shot and the event is sponsored by lenovo you want to try to prevent that
4401223 or remain at the back or in a storage facility
4401224 but if you start to layer in other elements theres a threshold at which it becomes damaging in the sponsorship category
4401225 you should not be able to leverage the good will of the games to your benefit without paying for it and thats really what were protecting against
4401226 ive been seeing the look and the graphics of the games around beijing and the scope and scale of what theyve managed to do here is enormous

4401230 die sp unterscheidet sich in ihrer europapolitik wesentlich von vp und fp w hrend die einen zu allem was aus br ssel kommt ja und amen sagen wollen die anderen in wirklichkeit den austritt aus der eu
4401231 aber es muss auch zul ssig sein dort verbesserungen zu fordern wo manche eu institutionen nicht einwandfrei funktionieren
4401232 die pensionistinnen und pensionisten haben dieses land aufgebaut und so viel geleistet wir k nnen viel von euch lernen daher ist es mein auftrag eure hart verdienten pensionen langfristig zu sichern und etwas gegen die teuerung zu unternehmen
4401233 auf euch kann man z hlen ihr seid die treuesten
4401234 als minister haben sie mir schon gut gefallen aber noch besser w ren sie als bundeskanzler
4401235 es ist die zeit gekommen unser system der rechts und amtshilfe im bereich der steuern auf eine neue grundlage zu stellen
4401236 wir sollten in zukunft all jenen staaten eine umfassende kooperation anbieten die bereit sind mit uns sinnvolle l sungen f r die gewachsenen kundenbeziehungen zu finden und an einer fairen und konstruktiven zusammenarbeit f r die zukunft interessiert sind
4401237 wir sind kein offshore platz im eigentlichen sinne sondern haben neben dem finanzplatz dessen onshore sektor immer st rker w chst einen bez glich wirtschaftsleistung und besch ftigten deutlich gr sseren und usserst erfolgreichen industriestandort
4401238 wir haben unseren beitrag f r den bisherigen verhandlungserfolg geleistet
4401239 bei einer verst rkten zusammenarbeit in steuerfragen k nnen diese chancen insbesondere im angebot von onshore dienstleistungen liegen gemeinn tzigen stiftungen versicherungen investmentfonds und pensionsfonds wird in den kommenden jahren ein grosses wachstum vorhergesagt und sie k nnen leichter vertrieben werden wenn sich liechtenstein auf das europ ische niveau im bereich der kooperation in steuerfragen begibt
4401240 denn w hrend viele staaten den gl sernen b rger einf hren pflegen wir eine kultur der privatsph re die weit ber das bankkundengeheimnis in steuerfragen hinausgeht
4401241 unser staat ist f r die b rger da und nicht die b rger f r unseren staat
4401242 the time has come for us to base our system of mutual legal assistance and administrative assistance in tax matters on a new foundation
4401243 in the future we should offer all states comprehensive cooperation if they are willing to find sensible solutions with us for the client relationships we have built up and if they are interested in fair and constructive cooperation for the future
4401244 we are not an offshore center as such but rather have in addition to the increasingly strong onshore sector of the financial center an extremely successful industrial sector which in terms of economic output and jobs is considerably larger than the financial sector
4401245 we have made our contribution to the success of the negotiations so far
4401246 with stronger cooperation in tax matters these opportunities may lie especially in onshore service offerings charitable foundations insurance companies investment funds and pension funds are expected to grow substantially in the coming years and they can be marketed more easily if liechtenstein adopts the european standard with respect to cooperation in tax matters
4401247 while many states are introducing the transparent citizen we practice a culture of privacy that goes far beyond bank client secrecy in tax matters
4401248 our state is here for its citizens not the other way around
4401249 dazu kommen noch ber 13 000 wienerinnen die landespflegegeld beziehen
4401250 auch die stadt wien wird analog zum bund das landespflegegeld erh hen
4401251 gerade f r diese gruppen war die erh hung des pflegegeldes und die bessere einstufung unbedingt notwendig
4401252 denn vor allem demenzkranke menschen haben einen stetig steigenden pflegebedarf
4401253 wir haben uns darauf geeinigt dass es eine mindestens zweistellige erh hung geben soll und danach eine regelm ige wertanpassung notwendig ist damit sind auch von der zuk nftigen bundesregierung weitere schritte gefordert
4401254 die pfl ger weltmeisterschaft steht f r einen fairen wettbewerb auf h chstem niveau aber auch f r eine begegnung von menschen aus vielen l ndern die wm ist ein treffen der landwirtschaft und eine plattform der internationalen verst ndigung f r jung und alt gro er dank geb hrt allen organisatoren und vor allem den zahlreichen mitgliedern der landjugend die mit ihrem beispiellosen engagement dieses fest m glich gemacht haben
4401255 pfl gen erfordert wie jeder sport regeln an denen die teilnehmer gemessen werden diese wurden vor jahren aufgestellt und haben sich in vielen wettk mpfen bew hrt das bewertungssystem wird aber auch st ndig weiterentwickelt um den innovationen rechnung tragen zu k nnen
4401256 die diskussion ber gesunde lebensmittel umwelt und klimaschutz und den schonenden umgang mit ressourcen sind in der heutigen gesellschaft pr senter als je zuvor die bodenbewirtschaftung durch pfl gen hat symbolkraft wie kein anderer landwirtschaftlicher bereich und ist die basis f r das ansehen das sterreichische produkte und landwirtschaftliche konzepte im ausland genie en daher freut es mich umso mehr dass bereits zum dritten mal die weltbesten pfl ger ihr k nnen in sterreich unter beweis stellen
4401257 mit dem kultur und veranstaltungszentrum grafenegg setzt das land nieder sterreich ein kulturpolitisches zeichen der offenheit und einer f r alle leistbaren kulturvermittlung frei nach dem motto kultur schafft arbeit f r viele und werte f r alle das handwerk des pfl gens ist ausdruck dessen und daher freut es mich besonders einen ad quaten rahmen f r die pfl ger wm zu verf gung stellen zu k nnen
4401258 die strafrahmen sehen sehr hohe strafen vor die beh rden sollten diesen rahmen gegen ber rowdys ausn tzen

4401261 the gori police chief is in gori trying to hold negotiations on the handover of the city
4401262 the trial must proceed even through the defendant is absent because they earlier agreed to allow the hearing to go on
4401263 talks are underway and many people are interested that the issue is settled amicably without going into the impeachment of president pervez musharraf
4401264 this impeachment process which can last months will be very damaging especially for the countrys economy the purpose of these talks is to settle the issue and there are many options under consideration
4401265 my belief is that the president does not intend to leave the country there is no question of him leaving pakistan
4401266 another option which i believe is under consideration is to reduce the status of the president to a figurehead where he is not empowered to dissolve the parliament and appoint armed forces chiefs and provincial governors
4401267 a show of unity and in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests

4401270 we cannot divulge the charges at this stage it is very sensitive and may put others on their guard so the information we gave is all we can give at this stage
4401271 dont just sit there and waste your precious time when you want to do something do it right away do it when you can its the only way to live a life without regrets
4401272 we followed up as many leads as we had we always considered moore a person of interest but back in 2003 we didnt have enough to make the case
4401273 the article came out in the paper and based on that we started getting new leads
4401274 this year youll see an even bigger difference because of the economy
4401275 this year the sales tax holiday is sure to be much needed and much appreciated by families shopping for school clothes and fall wardrobes
4401276 the main benefit is the tax savings on top of the fact that retailers have aggressive promotions
4401277 the holiday is always a good incentive to bring shoppers back downtown and take advantage of great offers that a lot of the stores have
4401278 downtown has everything from national retailers like bass shoes factory outlet chicos izod van heusen and a number of independents like douglas mens store footsies ha bas cruz cortez intima boutique nefertiti and many more
4401279 were expecting big crowds for the holiday weekend especially with gas prices right now
4401280 we would expect that a lot of people in the houston metro area who might have traveled further will take advantage of having great beaches and shopping on galveston island
4401281 something bordering on disbelief when he discovers that we extend the sphere of partisan control to the selection and preparation of experts

4401285 freely sharing with him confidential proprietary and trade secret information
4401286 a jury made a decision and now we have to deal with that
4401287 in my mind it will stop the shredding of the fabric of our community we must put opportunities in front of our children so that they can go to work and earn a living
4401288 to object to what you call government welfare is your privilege but its not something i can agree with
4401289 i hope you recognize that all the people who have spoken are giving a consistent message we are united together

4401301 during the first hour of interrogation one of my detectives came out and said that hed made an incriminating statement
4401302 i told him thats not good enough go back in there and get clothing and location all details
4401303 we didnt just want someone confessing to this crime we wanted necessary evidence the detailed information that only poole would have known about
4401304 when interrogating someone an officer has to be mindful and not deny food drink water support and respite
4401305 if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it people will eventually come to believe it the lie can be maintained only for such time as the state can shield the people from the political economic and or military consequences of the lie it thus becomes vitally important for the state to use all of its powers to repress dissent for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie and thus by extension the truth is the greatest enemy of the state

4401310 many ossetians i met both in tskhinvali and in the main refugee camp in russia are furious about what has happened to their city
4401311 they are very clear who they blame georgias president mikhail saakashvili who sent troops to re take control of this breakaway region
4401312 witness accounts and the timing of the damage would point to georgian fire accounting for much of the damage described in tskhinvali
4401313 this is something that had it been about south ossetia could have been resolved within certain limits
4401314 russian peacekeepers were in the area that is true and russia initially said it needed to act to protect its peacekeepers and its people
4401315 but what russia has done is well beyond anything that anyone could say is for the protection of those people and for those peacekeepers
4401316 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation is that clear enough

4401322 i called channel 9 because there are people out here i cant be the only one whos had a breach of contract
4401323 its their responsibility to reply and provide their side of the story and in this case theyve chosen not to do so
4401324 they need to go to the attorney generals office to make sure their name is on the list the attorney generals office will collectively try to get some money for them
4401325 they owe us quite a bit we stuck up to our side its time for them to stick up to their side
4401326 if it seems to good to be true it probably is

4401329 holding anger is a poison it eats you from the inside we think that hating is a weapon that attacks the person who harmed us but hatred is a curved blade and the harm we do we do to ourselves

4401334 better black television has been a vision of mine for some years
4401335 ive done a lot to promote and change the way messages are relayed to our children and our families over the last few years promoting positive content and positive messages is so important to educate and preserve the next generation being exposed to positive content is what changed my life i believe that there is a market in our community for a new diverse network that provides a new brand of superior programming that caters to all aspects of television from reality to original programming in addition im excited to be able to expose the urban community to a vast array of jobs in the entertainment community that they might not otherwise be privy to i have a great relationship with bet and mtv and my son and i will continue to do work with them and support their networks with bbtv were spearheading the initiative to meet consumer demand for family friendly hip hop content
4401336 were extremely proud of our programming that will be airing on bbtv
4401337 its extremely important to feed clean quality and positive subject matter to our families
4401338 i remember bob johnson founder of bet telling me back in the day that if you wanted to know real estate youve got to hang out with real estate investors if you wanted to know sports youve got to hang out with athletes i wanted to know tv so i hung out with bob and learned the tv game from one of the best in the business

4401351 hes the best in the game at getting into trouble and getting out of it
4401352 i dont know what it is keep on doing it though i guess youve come to deal with it now youve got to stay prepared for anything
4401353 obviously they gave us some pitches to hit and we did something with them
4401354 as a hitting coach thats what you hope for guys being patient enough to wait for the pitches they can drive and then doing it its easier said than done
4401355 were all embarrassed because we feel were better than that you cant go out there giving up seven runs eight runs a game and expect to have our offense pull us out you dont win with offense alone youve got to pitch
4401356 it just happens sometimes sometimes its just a feel thing he runs into those walks where he doesnt quite have a feel on the ball and the balls not going where he wants it to
4401357 i dont think i would trade that in for anything because i think thats part of what drives him youk he plays like a lot of guys that arent drafted in the first round he plays with a little bit of an im going to show you what i can do attitude we love guys like that he doesnt give away at bats he grinds out every at bat he wants a hit every time he hits the ball hard
4401358 i think he was a little concerned with the way he was feeling thats such an important part of your body for a hitter i think he wants to be careful with it and not really get to a point where hes going to miss a long period of time it was probably smart on his part and smart on franconas part to give him that day to ease his mind and rest a bit and both mentally and physically hes felt better
4401359 we may have to do that from time to time thats just the reality of what has happened
4401360 thats not the end of the world if we cant sit him every 10 days or so then were probably not good enough hes swinging the bat very aggressively and he feels good if we have to do it next week or whenever i have no problem with that
4401361 its probably more important who gets on in front of david than whos hitting behind him
4401362 if theres guys on base theyre going to pitch to him obviously if theres a base open theyre probably going to be more careful with him it doesnt hurt having youk hitting behind him doing what hes doing and dustin pedroia and j d drew getting on in front of him is also a huge help
4401363 im sure the mild oblique strain was played through before now medicine knows if you do that youre really risking a tear and then youre done
4401364 i thought oh my god im playing left field at fenway park thats where
4401365 it was a great feeling saying i got to play on that field for the boston red sox no one can ever take that away from me
4401366 its a tough time to go through because you think you prepare and you do everything youre supposed to do to go out and pitch and you dont get the results you want
4401367 thats real tough but thats what kind of stinks about being a starting pitcher you only get to do it every five days so you get a lot of time to think about it and overanalyze i think he just needs to go out and pitch and eventually it will work itself out
4401368 just eliminate the thought process eliminate the million things running through your head and just focus on one thing and get back up on the rubber
4401369 even if you make a mistake you can live with a mistake because its you know what i believed in that pitch and he hit it
4401370 as long as youre convicted with your pitches thats the biggest thing
4401371 officials in sarasota have made us aware of new potential sites for red sox spring training facilities
4401372 while we have yet to review and study these new alternatives we appreciate and are encouraged by the ongoing effort of both the elected officials and community leaders to collaborate on a plan that addresses our criteria

4401383 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4401384 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4401385 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4401386 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4401387 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4401388 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4401389 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4401390 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4401391 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4401490 as close to a certainty as youre going to get
4401491 we take into account things like dales audition tape in which he was derogatory about women and behaviour in the house things that the punters see as well and that really forms our opinion
4401492 i think when dale originally went up he was about 1 6 and then it was one way traffic 90 to 95 of all bets were on dale that explains the 1 100 price
4401493 if a lot of money comes in for one person they go shorter and shorter and shorter while the other goes out and out hopefully attracting people to bet on it
4401494 we now dread the weekly eviction as we are losing money every week punters are filling their boots
4401495 what happens to a large extent is quite a lot of people make money week in week out on the short priced favourites and then you put the whole lot on what looked like a certainty for the twins
4401496 a good bookmaker should break even when the favourite wins and then when the upset happens should make a lot of money
4401497 if you can get 1 10 a 10 increase on your money when the guy is virtually definitely going then thats a good price
4401498 its virtually risk free some of these are virtually risk free
4401499 but some of them arent and in the first weeks eviction mario was 1 10 and he stayed against steph
4401500 if i was the reader and if i had a newspaper i would like to read about somebody else like that
4401501 sure people who want to be international athletes they want the limelight
4401502 but i think maybe this is a little bit more than we would normally enjoy were kind of quiet people
4401503 one thing i said after the 2004 games with the crossfire that i had was that it was the one thing that got shooting on the map had i won that particular event it wouldnt have been as good a story to the general public its kind of the same thing here with his marriage this is fantastic for my sport its getting more people to understand what its about to understand it exists and thats perfect i couldnt be happier about that
4401504 its as good as i can do im extremely satisfied with my performance
4401505 its more than i ever could have dreamed of three medals for one family at the olympics is phenomenal
4401506 but it happens pretty much every great shooter i can think of has done it at least once somewhere
4401507 my main goal for the olympics and its the same this go around is to know that coming in id done everything i could to be prepared i didnt leave any stone unturned i gave it everything i had i knew i did i dont need some trinket to know what i did that day
4401508 i may not have continued shooting and gone on to marry katy to report corrections and clarifications contact reader editor
4401509 with their history i cant imagine a developer wanting to get involved considering where things are right now
4401510 i think it is a mistake to deal with property that is in the midst of litigation
4401511 id rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy
4401512 we woke up at 12 55 this morning to this almighty thundering noise we thought it was someone breaking in went downstairs and saw people outside it was total carnage the car had hit the kerb and ploughed into the fence taking out a concrete fence post and hitting the caravan
4401513 i told the fire brigade there were two gas bottles in the caravan so they doused everything down with water when they got into the car they turned round and said theyre both dead and everything slowed down at that point its a terrible way to go
4401514 i was speaking to two lads who were crossing the road seconds before they saw the car come screeching round the corner hit one kerb and then another lose control and then it must have blown a tyre as it hit our kerb and took off clearing the shrubbery before hitting the caravan it must have been some impact because there are parts of the car in the back garden a brake disc i think
4401515 it punched the caravan into the shed buckling the floor and the sheds hit the greenhouse my wifes fiestas a write off as well from the side impact my son has slept in that caravan before when weve had guests in the spare room ive mixed emotions this morning itll take a few days to get over obviously i feel for the two lads and their families
4401516 the investigation into the exact circumstances of this collision will continue but at this stage it is not believed that any other vehicle was involved nobody else was injured in the collision
4401517 good leaders create a vision articulate the vision passionately own the vision and relentlessly drive it to completion
4401518 the total insurance business will reach a level of rs 2 lakh crore in next two years from current level of rs 500 billion 5 000 crore
4401519 given the supply driven nature of the current inflation the rbis measures are likely to have limited impact towards controlling inflation in the short run
4401520 recent increase in policy rates could lead to upward movement in banks lending rates thereby increasing pressure on corporate margins also high interest rates would further dampen the demand in interest sensitive sectors we may witness deferment in investment decisions by companies

4401530 we have developed a new vaccine that is extremely safe easy to administer and which rapidly builds protection against hepatitis b infection
4401531 the same vaccine platform has also been shown to elicit significant immune responses in animal studies with influenza anthrax smallpox rsv and hiv plans are under way to begin testing in humans
4401532 patients who lack cellular immunity can build up the needed antibodies to eradicate viral particles in the blood and interstitial fluid but they may not be able to remove infected cells where the virus hides
4401533 this is often the case with chronically infected patients so our vaccine may be of particular benefit to this population of immune compromised individuals
4401534 this research is especially important because it opens new avenues for exploration of autoimmune disease that embrace the concepts of protein complementarity
4401535 the power of this approach has gone unappreciated even though the basic ideas of protein complementarity have been proven in other settings over the years
4401536 using an antibody reactive with complementary pr3 protein produced in the laboratory we analyzed protein pools removed from the patients plasma during plasma exchange therapy to identify any existing proteins that were reactive with the anti complementary pr3 antibody
4401537 identification of potentially pathogenic disease causing anti plasminogen antibodies provides an explanation of why patients with pr3 anca disease have a high incidence of blood clots
4401538 what is needed is a clinical test that is specific and precise enough to measure anti plasminogen antibody levels
4401539 hopefully our discoveries will entice scientists to consider the potential implications of protein complementarity
4401540 antibodies with dual reactivity to plasminogen and complementary pr3 in pr3 anca vasculitis
4401541 sometimes i turn around and look behind to make sure there are no men and thank god there arent any
4401542 it is haram forbidden in islam to strut around in front of men in a swimsuit
4401543 it is an excellent idea to have a beach reserved for women only
4401544 being a veiled woman i have no other option but to go to a women only beach
4401545 it is wonderful here we dont have to put up with the prying eyes of men but on the mixed beaches it is unbearable
4401546 at the end of the day we belong to a conservative society we cannot forget that
4401547 we need to respond to the needs of the community
4401548 this work changes the textbook picture of the lifecycle of the leishmaniasis parasite identifying the inflammatory cell known as the neutrophil as the predominant cell involved during the initiation of infection
4401549 parasites transmitted by sand flies to mice lacking neutrophils have more difficulty establishing an infection and surviving this demonstrates the importance of neutrophils at the site of an infected sand fly bite and suggests the unexpected path taken by the parasite from sand fly to neutrophil to macrophage is a critical component of this disease
4401550 our influenza program is a superb example of the convergence of both our novel rnai technologies and proprietary drug delivery capabilities
4401551 in order to accelerate development of this important lead candidate capitalize on the significant research effort conducted by our team and fully realize its commercial potential as a therapeutic against a pandemic influenza outbreak we are seeking a strategic partnership with a company focused in the biodefense or infectious disease area
4401552 there is a significant need for a safe and effective therapy that can target highly pathogenic influenza strains such as avian flu and to have that therapy stockpiled for a pandemic outbreak
4401553 capitalizing on both our proprietary rnai technologies and our proprietary drug delivery capabilities we have developed an rnai based compound that can address all strains of influenza a virus by targeting conserved regions of the influenza viral genome ongoing and future studies in collaboration with the u s centers for disease control and prevention will continue to analyze the intranasal delivery of our dicer substrate sirna for influenza and provide us further insight into the strength of our therapeutic and delivery approaches
4401554 the exceptional accuracy of the qtinno tm tool was clearly validated by this third and most challenging clinical study to date the evidence unequivocally demonstrates that the qtinno tm is not only faster at measuring the qt interval compared to current manual and semi automated approaches but that it also provides proven levels of accuracy even in challenging conditions and with complex compounds we believe it provides an important additional independent validation that will help potential customers recognize the value of newcardios cardiac assessment tool in aggregate the three independent studies collectively provide newcardio with a robust clinical validation portfolio that demonstrates qtinno tm accuracy and precision in measuring key drug safety metrics across a broad range of compounds and in comparison to a variety of manual and semi automated gold standard measurements from three different sources
4401555 the company is now actively pursuing commercial validation of qtinno tm and is in discussion with potential cro partners we also anticipate developing an interface to discuss these important and compelling clinical validation data with drug regulators we will soon augment our senior management team in an effort to add sales and marketing leadership to accelerate the commercialization initiative

4401587 initial reports and feedback from physicians involved with this clinical study have reported that patients have experienced no adverse side effects from rpi 78m
4401588 this is an important indicator of the success of this clinical study as it provides the medical and pharmacological communities with early evidence supporting the safety of our leading drug candidate rpi 78m
4401589 these results represent significant progress of a t cell engaging antibody for treatment of lymphoma patients as single agent therapy we observed tumor regression in patients at serum levels of blinatumomab which are approximately five orders of magnitude lower than serum levels needed by conventional monoclonal antibodies for achieving a tumor regression in this disease this may relate to the high anti tumor activity of cytotoxic t cells recruited by blinatumomab
4401590 this first observation of durable objective responses in relapsed incurable patients indicates the potential blinatumomab and bite antibodies in general may have in fighting cancer
4401591 can potentially lead to false reassurance and may lower motivation to engage in lifestyle modifications
4401592 our goal at sister to sister is to emphasize how vital it is for women to be adequately screened for potential cardiovascular disease
4401593 it is critical not only for women but for their families because they typically are the household decision makers about diet and exercise
4401594 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen

4401596 we expect to receive a more complete accounting of this violation of the justice departments guidelines intended to protect privacy and journalists first amendment rights
4401597 the first thing i do is put on workshops for senior management giving them an understanding of what an injury free environment is about the leadership it takes to create that and the management skills to sustain it
4401598 a culture that will say and do everything possible for injuries not to happen
4401599 the basic concept is you cannot separate safety from the way the project is designed organized and managed
4401600 its not just about policies and procedures and an approach to how to identify hazards and manage them but it was about rethinking how to view decisions and the consequences for others
4401601 that worked tremendously it had a ripple through the rest of the industry
4401602 we have looked at every possible way this is happening and have implemented programs where possible
4401603 if an individual decides to make a decision that goes against the rules and the programs implemented then that becomes a personnel issue
4401604 we brought in steves firm last october just to help us to look at continuous improvement model for our safety program
4401605 it wasnt a reaction to anything but just that with the scope of work we have out in this region we felt we needed some professional resources to help us to look at the processes and come up with a means and methods for us to continuously improve our safety efforts
4401606 there was nothing else we could possibly do to prevent the situation from happening again
4401607 im here to tell you that this project is safe enough that i would have my own children work on it otherwise i wouldnt be engaged in it
4401608 one of the reasons the intel projects work the way they do is because the owner intel is very very hands on
4401609 so if perini as the contractor is looking for improvement thats one piece but the intel model is one where the owner is all over everything
4401610 the changes were seeing on this large a project dont come easy
4401611 this project is the size of a city but weve been diligent in taking time in the field getting the word out that safety is the preeminent goal and that we want to send everyone home without injuries change is happening the culture is getting better
4401612 im very committed to making sure my kids have what they need
4401613 i dont care how many trips i have to make to officemax
4401614 the schools probably cannot operate given how deeply we cut them
4401615 there is going to be an impact to the cuts at our school
4401616 but we want to assure parents the needs of their children are being met
4401617 do i really need to do this activity thats going to require 200 sheets of paper or can i teach the same concept in a different way
4401618 demonstrate sensitivity to families when requesting donated items or supplies
4401619 the clark county school district provides students with the essential school supplies however many children enjoy bringing supplies to school you are welcome to purchase any of the items listed below
4401620 we have people losing their homes and their jobs we dont want schools passing on all of these problems to the parents
4401621 you have to satisfy the needs at the level where the children are
4401622 if that means cutting something out of the region office were going to bite the bullet and do it
4401623 the most surefire way to lower gasoline prices would be to strengthen the dollar
4401624 it was never a permanent organization we would create the structure from scratch every cycle
4401625 there was nothing good to say about being a democrat
4401626 i think for the first time in a lot of years i see a formidable grass roots and turnout network for the democrats
4401627 nevada is always important and this cycle its taken on a new importance
4401628 its one of these states thats spreading the map and its hard to do the math on how a democrat wins without strong turnout from union households
4401629 it takes a lot of time and effort and discipline to do it correctly
4401630 as long as theres somebody at the top and driving it very hard it works you can capture maintain and deliver votes
4401631 republicans didnt tend their field they didnt do the daily work
4401632 to do that we need more of what youre doing
4401633 identify mccain supporters now then rally them in the final week we cant win without nevada

4401638 we looked at offering our own subsidy but it was extremely costly
4401639 i thought we looked pretty competent when we left office i was saying the other night with this administration we look like we deserve the nobel prize
4401640 i think in the end law enforcement may have won
4401641 its always great to have an ice bar in the desert
4401642 its a neat gimmick in the desert but once again it illustrates the excesses that we market
4401643 i think that transporting the ice here and the carbon footprint that leaves is probably even more significant than the amount of water used

4401651 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4401652 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4401653 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4401654 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4401667 a great deal of time has passed since the kings wild company was last there and in the meantime yorkshiremen have acquired tollgates and newspapers and stagecoaches and circulating libraries and everything most modern and commonplace

4401727 the top rental markets were less impacted by the housing bubble bursting
4401728 the job growth in these markets is probably still good though the rate of job growth is declining
4401729 thats going to continue to happen until you see a decline in the for sale inventory once that happens people renting out these units will end up putting them up for sale and that will lessen the rental inventory

4401732 these creams we tested have tumorigenic tumor causing capability activities
4401733 i need to emphasize that what we have done is only in mice we dont know what the implications are for humans but it does raise a red flag that this is something that should be considered
4401734 we took out a couple of ingredients and made a cream that turned out to be non tumorigenic
4401735 we really dont know what ingredients in these creams are doing that
4401736 there is a need to have the various companies test their creams to see whether or not there is a problem
4401737 i am sure there are creams on the market that do not have tumorigenic activities and some of them may have anti tumorigenic activity
4401738 certainly the issue here is to protect yourself from that degree of continuous uvb induced priming for skin cancer by practicing good sun protection and sunscreen use in the first place
4401739 these moisturizing creams might act as an irritant or a promoter of skin cancer in mice skin but extensive study is needed before we advise people that their commonly used moisturizers can cause skin cancer

4401748 the absence of fossil evidence for intermediary stages between major transitions in organic design indeed our inability even in our imagination to construct functional intermediates in many cases has been a persistent and nagging problem for gradualistic accounts of evolution

4401756 there are many situations in which a pilot declares an emergency and in the vast majority of cases the pilot lands the plane safely
4401757 declaring an emergency gives that aircraft priority and ensures there is rescue equipment available in case there is a real problem

4401762 some 10 15 soldiers sprayed our car with weapons for at least 4 or 5 minutes i could not move the vehicle since the engine broke down we shouted at the soldiers that we were journalists we also took our t shirts off and waved them out of windows some 4 or 5 minutes later soldiers approached us

4401764 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4401765 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4401766 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4401767 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4401768 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4401769 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4401775 one reason i refuse to bother with the whole security circus is that i think it glorifies and thus encourages the wrong behaviour it makes heroes out of security people as if the people who dont just fix normal bugs arent as important in fact all the boring normal bugs are way more important just because theres a lot more of them
4401776 i think the openbsd crowd is a bunch of masturbating monkeys in that they make such a big deal about concentrating on security to the point where they pretty much admit that nothing else matters to them
4401777 revels in exposing vendor security holes because they see that as just another proof that the vendors are corrupt and crap which admittedly mostly are
4401778 both camps are whoring themselves out for their own reasons and both camps point fingers at each other as a way to cement their own reason for existence
4401779 you need to fix things early and that requires a certain level of disclosure for the developers
4401780 you also dont need to make a big production out of it
4401781 what does the whole security labelling give you except for more fodder for either of the pr camps that i obviously think are both idiots pushing for their own agenda
4401782 any situation that allows the vendor to sit on the bug for weeks or months is unacceptable as is any situation that makes it harder for people who find problems to talk to technical people
4401783 so the whole embargoes are good mentality is just corruption from the vendors
4401784 but on the other hand disclosure should not be the goal
4401785 have a model where security is easier to do in the first place that is the unix model but make it easy for people to report bugs with no embargo but privately
4401786 i want to apologise for the disruption and difficulty this issue may have caused to our customers and our partners your confidence in vmware is extremely important to us and we are committed to restoring that confidence fully and quickly
4401787 we are doing everything in our power to make sure this doesnt happen again
4401788 vmware prides itself on the quality and reliability of our products and this incident has prompted a thorough self examination of how we create and deliver products to our customers we have kicked off a comprehensive in depth review of our qa quality assurance and release processes and will quickly make the needed changes
4401789 the issue was caused by a piece of code that was mistakenly left enabled for the final release of update 2
4401790 this piece of code was left over from the pre release versions of update 2 and was designed to ensure that customers are running on the supported generally available version of update 2
4401791 this certainly appears to be the most publicised bug for vmware so far and i think it is damaging to vmware and virtualisation as a whole the hypervisor is the lowest software level on the server and if you have an issue like this boom all your infrastructure is down

4401793 this year youll see an even bigger difference because of the economy
4401794 this year the sales tax holiday is sure to be much needed and much appreciated by families shopping for school clothes and fall wardrobes
4401795 the main benefit is the tax savings on top of the fact that retailers have aggressive promotions
4401796 the holiday is always a good incentive to bring shoppers back downtown and take advantage of great offers that a lot of the stores have
4401797 downtown has everything from national retailers like bass shoes factory outlet chicos izod van heusen and a number of independents like douglas mens store footsies ha bas cruz cortez intima boutique nefertiti and many more
4401798 were expecting big crowds for the holiday weekend especially with gas prices right now
4401799 we would expect that a lot of people in the houston metro area who might have traveled further will take advantage of having great beaches and shopping on galveston island
4401800 we felt there was sufficient evidence to back it up

4401808 saya sering berhadapan dengan tentara tentara di daerah konflik jika saya ingin mencegah dan menghentikan mereka dengan tangan atau kontak fisik bisa dipastikan beberapa detik kemudian saya sudah tergeletak di tanah mereka sangat terlatih
4401809 karena itu yang saya pasang wajah tepat di depan muka jelek mereka itu sering kali membuat senjata mereka tidak lagi berguna mereka segan menembak
4401810 sebelumnya saya meminta maaf kepada umat muslim atas perbuatan orang orang kristen saya sangat malu dengan apa yang telah diperbuat orang orang dari agama saya terhada islam saya tidak mampu berbincang dengan muslim sebelum meminta maaf
4401811 sebuah tank datang menderu di hadapanku moncong raksasanya mengarah kepadaku aku mengangkat kedua tanganku di udara berdoa dan berteriak tembak tembak terpujilah nama tuhan tank itu berhenti beberapa inci di hadapanku aku lantas berlutut di jalanan berdoa dengan tangan terangkat di udara aku merasa sendiri lemah dan tak berdaya aku hanya bisa menjerit kepada tuhan
4401812 saya mempelajari dari injil sebagai umat kristen saya harus mengakui kelemahan diri sendiri lalu bergantung sepenuhnya hanya kepada allah
4401813 art juga terlibat aktif dalam kegiatan kegiatan anti perang vietnam setiap hari senin dia melakukan peace vigil selama satu jam di depan gedung walikota sering dia hanya sendirian atau bersama istrinya peggy gish kalau yang bersangkutan juga sedang tidak keluar kota
4401814 ia mampu mengangkat kejadian mikroskopik dalam wilayah palestina yang justru menunjukkan kebenaran sesungguhnya di sana
4401815 boleh saja rakyat palestina mengunakan simbol simbol islam tetapi untuk propaganda internasional hal itu tak akan kondusif
4401816 masalah palestina telah bergeser dari soal nasionalisme ke arah arah perjuangan dengan membawa simbol simbol agama
4401817 kita jangan hanya cenderung menilai bangsa dari sisi negatif saja ada memang negatifnya tapi melihat bangsa ini harus secara keseluruhan ini ada prestasi
4401818 coba bandingkan saat ini kalau pun ada satu dua yang berkelahi tetapi bukan soal ham karena bukan konflik
4401819 jika dibandingkan negara lain seperti malaysia burma myanmar red thailand china kita boleh berargumentasi mana yang tertinggi menghargai ham di negara tersebut jika dibanding kita
4401820 amerika yang negara maju saja sampai saat ini belum menemukan pembunuh kennedy
4401821 jangan hanya menganggap jika ada masalah yang melanggar ham yang disalahkan selalu polisi mungkin benar polisi melanggar tapi perlu ditanyakan kenapa terjadi begitu
4401822 perjuangan itu menjadi salah satu faktor penting berakhirnya era orde baru sekaligus munculnya era reformasi
4401823 perumusan tentang ham dalam konstitusi kita sangat lengkap dan menjadikan uud 1945 menjadi salah satu uud di dunia yang paling lengkap memuat ketentuan perlindungan ham
4401824 di dalam hal ini mk perlu menetapkan apakah pasal pasal uud 1945 adalah kokoh atau norma aspiratif
4401825 prinsip demokrasi di indonesia sudah baik tetapi pada pelaksanannya mengalami banyak problematis
4401826 tidak semua yang bersifat partikular dan lokal selalu bersesuaian dengan yang ajaran universal demokratis
4401827 aksi aksi teror tersebut sangat mengancam bagi pelaksanaan kebebasan beragama dan merusak citra islam
4401828 seperti bom natal tahun 2000 sangat mengganggu kerukunan umat beragama
4401829 karena perda perda tersebut telah diintrepretasikan secara literal yang dapat mengancam terjadinya pelanggaran hak hak sipil warga negara dan perusakan terhadap budaya bhineka tungal ika
4401830 kasus tersebut perlu dicermati bersama agar gerakan syariahisasi hukum islam tidak hanya ditempatkan pada lokus formil yang justru dapat menciderai hak hak sipil dan kebebasan tafsir agama
4401831 kedua negara melakukan pelanggaran secara langsung melalui pembuatan kebijakan yang membatasi kebebasan beragama dan berkeyakinan
4401832 selain itu patut juga dipertimbangkan peran media dan ormas ormas dalam membangun karakter masyarakat yang lebih toleran
4401833 tidak ada paksaan bagi orang non muslim untuk memeluk agama islam
4401834 secara prinsipil tidak ada masalah antara islam dan duham kecuali pasal 16 dan 18 namun pada tingkat praktis makna kebebasan itu perlu dibatasi agar terhindar dari onflik sosial
4401835 seperti keadilan toleransi penghargaan atas keyakinan orang lain dan sebagainya
4401836 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
4401837 sesungguhnya mereka kaum yang beriman kaum muslim kaum yahudi kaum nasrani kaum sabian siapa saja yang beriman kepada allah dan hari kemudian serta berbuat kebaikan maka tidak ada rasa takut menimpa mereka dan mereka pun tidak perlu khawatir q
4401838 karena pesan tuhan itu satu sama maka agama islam mengakuikeimanan yang benar dalambentuk bentuk lain asalkan keimanan itu tulus didukung oleh akal sehat dan ditunjang oleh tingkah laku yang penuh kebaikan
4401839 pendapatku benar tapi mungkin saja salah sebaliknya pendapat orang lain salah tapi bisa saja benar
4401840 we followed up as many leads as we had we always considered moore a person of interest but back in 2003 we didnt have enough to make the case
4401841 the article came out in the paper and based on that we started getting new leads

4401846 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defense system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia

4401856 the deliberate attempt to manage the publics perception of a subject

4401869 the future role of the military remains an open question the officer corps has agreed that multiparty elections should again become the norm of burmas political system but no one familiar with burmas political history expects the military to abandon all its administrative and political functions after the formation ofa new government the continuing insurgencies in peripheral areas the deep involvement of military personnel in a variety of government economic and social enterprises and the militarys own ethos formed over 40 years of experience makes such a prospect unlikely

4402012 prominent supporters and high level campaign officials are having private campaign meetings in aspen tomorrow
4402013 detectives believe it has more than enough properties to provide the information they are seeking
4402014 this has quietly and insidiously grown into a big problem
4402015 its not a creepy guy in an overcoat pushing drugs this is about medications that are in your home prescription drugs are the drug of choice for teens who are trying drugs for the first time they are getting drugs from their parents or their grandparents medicine cabinets
4402016 more and more they are coming in strung out on prescription pill opiates
4402017 teenagers and young people across the country can often get dangerous drugs on the internet
4402018 we need to stop it and this bill would be a major step forward
4402019 you can get addicted anytime but the two most vulnerable times are adolescence and old age
4402020 a lot of parents arent very aware often they are the last to know many parents dont get their teens to us until their senior year of high school then they lament not bringing them in when they are 15 or 16
4402021 they tend to forget the pills are in there or they feel they paid for them and dont want to toss them
4402022 its an invitation if a teenager is looking for drugs teenagers are prone to experimentation and having the medication in the home makes it easier because it is free we need to make parents more accountable to their medications when you are done with them throw them out
4402023 preventing substance abuse among teens is primarily a mom and pop operation
4402024 it is inexcusable that there are so many problem parents who dont try harder who fail to appropriately monitor their children on school nights fail to keep dangerous prescription drugs out of their reach and tolerate drug infected schools for their children
4402025 the jewish people as a whole will be its own messiah it will attain
4402026 great strength of thought and insight its design is well above the abilities of an ordinary mind it is more complicated than a nuclear bomb
4402027 when a government is dependent for money upon the bankers they and not the leaders of the government control the situation since the hand that gives is above the hand that takes financiers are without patriotism and without decency
4402028 money plays the largest part in determining the course of history
4402029 the conditions were so reversed that the era of prosperity ended
4402030 the colonies would gladly have borne the little tax on tea and other matters had it not been the poverty caused by the bad influence of the english bankers on the parliament which has caused in the colonies hatred of england and the revolutionary war
4402031 coin money and regulate the value thereof article 1 section 8
4402032 no state shall enter into any treaty alliance or confederation grant letters of marque and reprisal coin money emit bills of credit make any thing by gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts pass any bill of attainder ex post facto law or law impairing the obligation of contracts or grant any title of nobility
4402033 the bank hath benefit of interest on all monies which it creates out of nothing
4402034 the banks can and do create money and they who control the credit of the nation direct the policy of governments and hold in the hollow of their hands the destiny of the people
4402035 all communities divide themselves into the few and the many the first are rich and well born the other the mass of the people the people are turbulent and changing they seldom judge or determine right
4402036 to preserve our independence we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt if we run into such debts we will then be taxed in our meat and our drink in our necessities and in our comforts in our labor and in our amusements if we can prevent the government from wasting the labor of the people under the pretense of caring for them they will be happy
4402037 either the application for renewal of the charter is granted or the united states will find itself in a most disastrous war
4402038 teach these impudent americans a lesson bring them back to colonial status
4402039 the dominion which the banking institutions have obtained over the minds of our citizens must be broken or it will break us
4402040 if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issuance of their currency first by inflation and then by deflation the banks and the corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the government to whom it properly belongs
4402041 if congress has the right under the constitution to issue paper money it was given them to be used by themselves not to be delegated to individuals or to corporations
4402042 would be exercised by a few over the political conduct of the many by first acquiring that control over the labor and earnings of the great body of people
4402043 you are a den of vipers i intend to rout you out and by the eternal god i will rout you out
4402044 if the people only understood the rank injustice of our money and banking system there would be a revolution before morning
4402045 our currency receiving our public monies and holding thousands of our citizens in dependence it would be more formidable and dangerous than the naval and military power of the enemy
4402046 this is the crowning glory of a j s life and the most important service he has ever rendered his country
4402047 the bank of the united states has set itself up as a great irresponsible rival power of the government
4402048 for removing the governments deposits from the bank of the united states without the express authorization of the united states congress
4402049 combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary machinery of peacetime government had assumed control of various southern states
4402050 england will take advantage of the first opportunity to recognize the seceded states and that france will follow her
4402051 to be ready to fight any power and to take their orders only from abraham lincoln
4402052 the privilege of creating and issuing money is not only the supreme prerogative of government but is the governments greatest creative opportunity by the adoption of these principles the taxpayers will be saved immense sums of interest
4402053 if that mischievous financial policy which had its origin in the north america republic during the late war in that country should become indurated down to a fixture then that government will furnish its own money without cost it will pay off its debts and be without debt it will become prosperous beyond precedent in the history of the civilized governments of the world the brains and wealth of all countries will go to north america that government must be destroyed or it will destroy every monarchy on the globe
4402054 he obtained from congress the right to borrow from the people by selling to it the bonds of states and the government and the nation escaped the plots of the foreign financiers they understood at once that the united states would escape their grip the death of lincoln was resolved upon
4402055 in promoting the passage of the national banking act was the greatest financial mistake of my life it has built up a monopoly which affects every interest in the country it should be repealed but before that can be accomplished the people will be arrayed on one side and the bankers on the other in a contest such as we have never seen before in this country
4402056 the money power preys upon the nation in times of peace and conspires against it in times of adversity it is more despotic than monarchy more insolent than autocracy more selfish than bureaucracy i see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country corporations have been enthroned an era of corruption in high places will follow and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in the hands of a few and the republic is destroyed i feel at the moment more anxiety for the safety of my country than ever before even in the midst of war
4402057 whoever controls the money of a nation controls that nation
4402058 j p morgan with the assistance and cooperation of a few of the interlocking corporations which reach all over the united states in their influence controls every railroad in the united states they control practically every public utility they control literally thousands of corporations they control all of the large insurance companies mr president we are gradually reaching a time if we have not already reached that point when the business of the country is controlled by men who can be named on the fingers of one hand because those men control the money of the nation and that control is growing at a rapid rate
4402059 mr paul warburg is the man who got the federal reserve act together after the aldrich plan aroused such nationwide resentment and opposition the mastermind of both plans was alfred rothschild of london
4402060 the federal reserve act is the work of mr paul warburg more than any other man in the country
4402061 unless we have a central bank with adequate control of credit resources this country is going to undergo the most severe and far reaching money panic in history
4402062 mr house is my second personality he is my independent self his thoughts and mine are one if i were in his place i would do just as he suggested if anyone thinks he is reflecting my opinion by whatever action he takes they are welcome to the conclusion
4402063 when the federal reserve legislation at last assumed definite shape house was the intermediary between the white house and the financiers
4402064 why not give mr paul warburg the job he would be the financial boss and i would be the political boss and we could run the country together
4402065 i do not feel it is any exaggeration to speak of our secret expedition to jekyll island as the occasion of the actual conception of what eventually became the federal reserve system
4402066 on tuesday the president of princeton university will be elected governor of your state he will not complete his term of office as governor in november 1912 he will be elected president of the united states in march 1917 he will be inaugurated for the second time as president he will be one of the greatest presidents in american history
4402067 my hat is in the ring the fight is on and i am stripped to the buff
4402068 we are opposed to the so called aldrich currency bill because its provisions would place our currency and credit system in private hands not subject to effective public control
4402069 free the poor people of america from control by the rich
4402070 a concentration of the control of credit may at any time become infinitely dangerous to free enterprise
4402071 a combination of political realities and his own lack of knowledge about banking and finance and after his election to the presidency wilson relied on others for more expert advice on the currency question
4402072 concentrated in the city of new york where they now dominate more than 75 percent of the moneyed interests of america
4402073 i believe the money power now lies in the hands of a dozen men
4402074 securing the passage of the bill at the earliest possible moment
4402075 that is the one thing in my public career that i regret my work to secure the enactment of the federal reserve law
4402076 i had never thought the federal bank system would prove such a failure the country is in a state of irretrievable bankruptcy
4402077 the money and credit resources of the united states were now in complete control of the bankers alliance between j p morgans first national bank and kuhn amp loebs national city bank whose principal loyalties were to the international banking interests then quartered in london and which moved to new york during the first world war
4402078 the federal reserve bank is an institution owned by the stockholding member banks the government has not a dollars worth of stock in it
4402079 the growth of the nation and all our activities are in the hands of a few men we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government of free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the free vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men
4402080 lenin is to have declared that the best way to destroy the capitalist system was to debauch the currency by a continuing process of inflation governments can confiscate secretly and unobserved an important part of the wealth of their citizens as the inflation proceeds and the real value of the currency fluctuates wildly from month to month all permanent relations between debtors and creditors which form the ultimate foundation of capitalism become so utterly disordered as to be almost meaningless
4402081 this act establishes the most gigantic trust on earth when the president signs this act the invisible government by the money power proven to exist by the money trust investigation will be legalized this is the aldrich bill in disguise the new law will create inflation whenever the trusts want inflation from now on depressions will be scientifically created the worst legislative crime of the ages is perpetrated by this banking and currency bill
4402082 the bill as it stands seems to me to open the way to vast expansion of the currency i do not like to think that any law can be passed which will make it possible to submerge the gold standard in a flood of irredeemable paper currency
4402083 the federal reserve board and banks are the duly appointed agents of the foreign central banks of issue and they are more concerned with their foreign customers than they are with the people of the united states the only thing that is american about the federal reserve board and banks is the money they use
4402084 we have in this country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known i refer to the federal reserve board and the federal reserve banks some people think the federal reserve banks are united states government institutions they are not government institutions they are private credit monopolies which prey upon the people of the united states for the benefit of themselves and their foreign customers the federal reserve banks are the agents of the foreign central banks in that dark crew of financial pirates there are those who would cut a mans throat to get a dollar out of his pocket every effort has been made by the federal reserve board to conceal its powers but the truth is the fed has usurped the government it controls everything here in congress and controls all our foreign relations it makes and breaks governments at will when the fed was passed the people of the united states did not perceive that a world system was being set up here a super state controlled by international bankers and international industrialists acting together to enslave the world for their own pleasure
4402085 whereas i charge them jointly and severally with having brought about a repudiation of the national currency of the united states in order that the gold value of said currency might be given to private interests i charge them with having arbitrarily and unlawfully taken over 80 000 000 000 from the united states government in the year 1928 i charge them with having arbitrarily and unlawfully raised and lowered the rates on money increased and diminished the volume of currency in circulation for the benefit of private interests i charge them with having brought about the decline of prices on the new york stock exchange i charge them with having conspired to transfer to foreigners and international money lenders title to and control of the financial resources of the united states i charge them with having published false and misleading propaganda intended to deceive the american people and to cause the united states to lose its independence i charge them with the crime of having treasonably conspired and acted against the peace and security of the united states and with having treasonably conspired to destroy the constitutional government of the united states
4402086 does it not seem strange to you that these men just happened to be cfr council on foreign relations and just happened to be on the board of governors of the federal reserve that absolutely controls the money and interest rates of this great country a privately owned organization which has absolutely nothing to do with the united states of america
4402087 besides its controlling interest in the federal reserve bank of new york the rothschilds had developed important financial interests in other parts of the united states the entire rockefeller empire was financed by the rothschilds
4402088 the rothschild banks are affiliated with manufacturers hanover of london in which they hold 20 percent and manufacturers hanover trust of new york
4402089 the surest way to overthrow an established social order is to debauch its currency
4402090 lenin was certainly right there is no more positive or subtler no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency the process engages all of the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction and does it in a manner that not one man in a million is able to diagnose
4402091 redeemable in gold on demand at the united states treasury or in gold or lawful money at any federal reserve bank
4402092 this note is legal tender for all debts public and private and is redeemable in lawful money at the united states treasury or at any federal reserve bank
4402093 in fact there has never been an independent audit of either the twelve banks of the federal reserve board that has been filed with the congress for 40 years the system while freely using the money of the government has not made a proper accounting
4402094 one of the most secret societies these twelve men decide what happens in the economy in making decisions they check with no one not the president not the congress not the people
4402095 in the united states we have in effect two governments we have the duly constituted government then we have an independent uncontrolled and uncoordinated government in the federal reserve system operating the money powers which are reserved to congress by the constitution
4402096 to vest in the government of the united states the full absolute complete and unconditional ownership of the twelve federal reserve banks
4402097 the federal reserve is not an agency of government it is a private banking monopoly
4402098 as you well know i dont have control over the fed none at all its carefully isolated from any influence by the president or the congress this has been done for many generations and i think its a wise thing to do
4402099 300 banks with deposits of 18 4 billion have quit the fed within the past 4 1 2 years
4402100 ought to evolve into a world central bank to prevent inflation
4402101 if carter introduces bancor which will be the yielding of our dollar to the ecu european currency unit this is what will happen look for hyperinflation and collapse of all the worlds paper money before 1985
4402102 the united states is trying to solve its problem through currency depreciation debasement it will not work if the crash does not occur this year it could be postponed until 1982
4402103 the most serious problem we face today is the debasement of our currency by the government the government will continue to debase the dollar until within 12 24 months it will shrink to 1 cent at which time washington will be forced to create the new hard currency a currency reform is nothing but a fancy name for state bankruptcy a currency reform completes the expropriation of all kinds of savings it will wipe out all public and private bonds most pensions all annuities and all endowments
4402104 i believe its in the billions of dollars and its buried in lots of places
4402105 in a closed briefing for the members of the house banking committee on november 2nd representatives of the bureau of engraving and printing the federal reserve and the secret service described plans for making changes in federal reserve notes beginning in 1985 although the long range target is 1988 these changes which will probably include taggents security threads and colors and may include holograms diffraction gratings or watermarks will be made in coordination with six other nations canada britain japan australia west germany and switzerland japan for example will begin recalling its present currency in november 1984 and have it nearly completed within six months according to the government the only reason for the currency changes is to deter counterfeiting although it was admitted by one spokesman in the group that there would have to be a call in of our present currency for new currency to work the spokesmen for the government were adamant in saying that there was no other motive for a currency change
4402106 the fed will have the capability to physically replace the entire u s currency in circulation in just four days time
4402107 the real truth of the matter is and you and i know that a financial element in the large centers has owned the government of the u s since the days of andrew jackson
4402108 it is well enough that the people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system for if they did i believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning
4402109 i believe that if the people of this nation fully understood what congress has done to them over the past 49 years they would move on washington they would not wait for an election it adds up to a preconceived plan to destroy the economic and social independence of the united states
4402110 in the certified copies of the resolutions passed by the legislatures of the several states ratifying the proposed 16th amendment it appears that only four of these resolutions those submitted by arizona north dakota tennessee and new mexico have quoted absolutely accurately and correctly the 16th amendment as proposed by congress the other thirty three resolutions all contain errors either of punctuation capitalization or wording minnesota it is to be remembered did not transmit to the department a copy of the resolution passed by the legislature of the state the resolutions passed by twenty two states contain errors only of capitalization or punctuation or both while those of eleven states contain errors in the wording
4402111 the congress shall have power to exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over such district not exceeding ten miles square as may by cession of particular states and the acceptance of congress become the seat of the government of the united states and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be for the erection of forts magazines arsenals dockyards and other needful building
4402112 the doctrine of emergency is the worst it means that when congress declares an emergency there is no constitution this means its dead
4402113 the united states has been in a state of declared national emergency a majority of the people of the united states have lived all their lives under emergency rule for 40 years freedoms and governmental procedures guaranteed by the constitution have in varying degrees been abridged by laws brought into force by states of national emergency
4402114 authorities under the act of october 6 1917 as amended
4402115 this was a classic example of sleight of hand in fact congress exempted all laws based on the emergency of 1933 that were already in place rather than being based on the authority of the president under a national emergency these federal laws would now be codified as a permanent part of the u s federal code included among the codified laws would be section 5 b of the trading with the enemy act which classifies the american citizen as an enemy of the government
4402116 president may seize property organize commodities assign military forces abroad institute martial law seize and control transportation and communication regulate operation of private enterprise restrict travel and in a plethora of particular ways control the lives of all american citizens
4402117 property which every man has is his own labor and as it is the original foundation of all other property so it is the most sacred and inviolable
4402118 a slip of ribbon parchment or paper attached as a codicil to a deed or other writing to hold the appended seal
4402119 we ought to have realized that the income tax is utterly incompatible with liberty it is actually a form of slavery a slave is someone the fruit of whose labor is controlled by somebody else a slave is not somebody with nothing rather he has only what the master lets him have under the income tax the government takes whatever percentage of the earners income it wants the income tax therefore represents our national surrender to the government of control over all the money we earn there are in principle no restrictions to the pre emptive claim the government has
4402120 to ameliorate that distressed condition of those unhappy females who have been seduced from the paths of virtue and are desirous of returning to a life of rectitude
4402121 only one third of the income of the nation is actually taxed
4402122 foundations and organizations are using their resources for purposes other than the purposes for which they were established and especially to determine which such foundations and organizations are using their resources for un american and subversive activities or for purposes not in the interest or tradition of the united states
4402123 to penetrate these organizations foundations if necessary take control of them and their treasuries that they should be able to finance the communist party propaganda in the united states
4402124 mr hays told us one day that the white house had been in touch with him and asked him if he would cooperate to kill the committee
4402125 reached far into government into the policy making circles of congress and into the state department
4402126 substantial evidence indicates there is more than a mere close working together among some foundations operating in the international field
4402127 it has been said that the foundations are a power second only to that of the federal government itself perhaps the congress should now admit that the foundations have become more powerful in some areas at least than the legislative branch of the government
4402128 to drive others from the field and exclude them from their right to trade
4402129 seven men and a corporate machine have conspired against their fellow citizens for the safety of the republic we now decree that the dangerous conspiracy must be ended
4402130 to promote the well being of mankind throughout the world
4402131 challenge of the future is to make this one world
4402132 so it may come to pass that someday no one will speak of my country but all will speak of our world
4402133 an almost unbroken line of biological relationships from the rockefellers through one half of the wealthiest sixty families in the nation
4402134 there is only one vehicle in russia that uses that type of engine and thats a russian battle tank
4402135 a few banking institutions are in a position to exercise significant influence and perhaps even control over some of the largest business enterprises in the nation
4402136 been used to finance individuals and organizations whose business it has been to get communism into private and public schools of the country to talk down to america and play up russia
4402137 support of efforts in the u s and abroad that contribute ideas develop leaders and encourage institutions in the transition to global interdependence
4402138 our schools are performing an infinite significant religious work they are promoting the social unity out of which in the end genuine religious unity must grow
4402139 to promote the advancement and diffusion of knowledge and understanding among the people of the united states by aiding technical schools institutions of higher learning libraries scientific research hero funds useful publications and by such other agencies and means as shall time to time be found appropriate therefore
4402140 an unofficial instrument of international policy taking up here and there the ends of international problems and questions which the governments find it difficult to handle and reaching conclusions which officially find their way into the policies of government
4402141 that the endowment work for the establishment of the united nations headquarters in new york that the endowment construct its programs primarily for the support of the united nations that the endowments programs should be broadly educational in order to encourage public understanding and support of the united nations at home and abroad that endowment supported organizations such as international relations clubs in colleges the foreign policy association the institute of pacific relations the council on foreign relations and local community groups be utilized to achieve these goals of achieving broader understanding and support for the united nations
4402142 see to it that the war does not end too quickly
4402143 to bring the idea of one world government to the point where it is acceptable to the people of this country that is the primary aim and everything that has happened since then is a means to that one end
4402144 only way to maintain control of the population was to obtain control of education in the u s they realized this was a prodigious task so they approached the rockefeller foundation with the suggestion that they go in tandem and that portion of education which could be considered as domestically oriented be taken over by the rockefeller foundation and that portion which was oriented to international matters be taken over by the carnegie endowment
4402145 they decided that the success of this program lay in an alteration in the matter in which american history was to be presented
4402146 that most of the men who are now running the foundations formerly worked for the state department the united nations relief and rehabilitation association the marshall plan or other foreign relief agencies and that in those capacities they were working under instructions from the white house to bring about such sociological economic and political changes as would make union with communist russia easy and comfortable for the american people now in the foundations we are working toward the same objectives
4402147 substance of the directives under which we operate is that we shall use our grant making power so to alter life in the united states that we can be comfortably merged with the soviet union
4402148 it was no accident it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so they might emerge as the rulers of us all
4402149 everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers
4402150 we wanted to make a statement that we were a better team than we were in 06
4402151 of course we want to continue to get better its only game 3 its a win another win we have to learn from it but we have to move on to the next one
4402152 even from the warm up they had a big motivation to win this game
4402153 its normal for them it was a disappointment to lose to us a small country overseas i think the motivation was very clear
4402154 we wanted to come out and play well of course you wanted to play well because its the last team we lost to we didnt do so well but they played better than us in 2006 its something that we thought we had to get off of our back and we did that
4402155 we are not changing our style because we play against the usa
4402156 the only difference is we dont have the pressure we can be smarter than them and beat them
4402157 spain is good theyre a good team its going to be a good game they have a lot of weapons that they can throw at you they know each other theyve been playing together for a while theyre a very good team we look forward to the matchup

4402160 parents and school administrators of english learners are impatient with this yearly lament over the persistent achievement gap and the failure to offer practical solutions to reverse the negative trend in the academic achievement of english learners
4402161 with this rate of progress it would take 55 years for all of our current english learners to become proficient
4402162 if you spend all your time teaching kids to take multiple choice tests you cant spend as much time teaching them to write a literary essay
4402163 our focus is on giving them the skills they need
4402164 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4402165 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4402166 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4402167 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4402168 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4402169 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state

4402210 victorias horse racing industry has a culture of tolerating criminality
4402211 it appears many horse racing industry participants were not concerned with whether or not funds used to engage in betting were legitimately attained
4402212 its organised crime presence is most apparent in the betting ring where the laundering of the proceeds of crime had been commonplace
4402213 the recommendations in this report are designed to address the problem although i acknowledge that it is not easy to combat what has been historically a tolerance of criminality
4402214 it is an insult to the 99 percent of trainers jockeys and bookmakers and anybody else who works in the industry
4402215 people slave their guts out all day to earn an honest living

4402219 we were surprised how many times we found that employers dress codes did not permit the wearing of comfortable sensible footwear by women

4402485 because of the nature of the business theres a lot of travel involved odd hours thereve been times we all live under the same roof but we havent seen each other for days on end
4402486 its wonderful to get an opportunity to spend six weeks on the road with the family i dont think weve spent this amount of time and this quality of time for over 10 years together
4402487 when we see the live audience hear their roar hear their appreciation that is the incentive

4402490 its very heartening to know that indian films are viewed in all these places and its wonderful to know that you reach out to so many people and they appreciate your work
4402491 that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4402492 i do this out of a sense of participating in democracy
4402493 when the opportunity came up to take our electric guitars and make some unholy noise to try to stop a war it sounded familiar to me
4402494 its something we did 40 years ago as part of a generation that said the war in vietnam was wrong and needed to stop were part of a generation saying the war in iraq is wrong and needs to stop

4402499 hes one of the best bass players weve got in this business and to finally see him get recognition after standing behind for all these years is just wonderful
4402500 its always an honor to get nominated and its always a surprise too
4402501 you know theres a lot of young bands out there that are really entertaining the people these days id rather one of them would win it because theyre great but i still love talking to people on stage and we do requests from the audience all the time i figure they pay to get in to see you so you need to do what they want you to do

4402554 fact of the matter is that people hear about hiv and we know about hiv but we never believe that hiv could happen to us
4402555 im pretty sure hiv presented itself several times i just never thought it could happen to me so i didnt care
4402556 what it really means to have to manage this disease on a day to day basis
4402557 our prevention measures have yet to reach optimum success because many high risk people here still refuse to use condoms even though we have actually managed to reach them
4402558 this is different from cambodia for example where people are willing to comply with the government campaigns for use of condoms
4402559 a woman who is abused by her husband is truly placed in a situation of double jeopardy regarding hiv infection
4402560 sexual behavior outside of the marriage makes it more likely he is infected with the virus and his abusive behavior inside the marriage leaves her with little over control sex or sexual protection
4402561 so that when theres a disease outbreak health officials have some idea how to answer what if questions
4402562 once you understand how much interaction there is you can actually start predicting when you think the disease will get to other groups
4402563 if a knife is to be re used on another person it first has to be sterilized

4402584 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4402585 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4402586 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4402587 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4402588 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4402589 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4402590 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4402591 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4402592 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4402593 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4402594 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4402595 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4402596 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4402597 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4402598 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4402599 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4402600 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4402601 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4402602 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4402603 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4402604 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4402605 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4402606 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4402607 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4402608 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4402609 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4402610 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4402611 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4402612 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4402613 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4402614 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4402615 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4402616 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4402617 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4402618 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4402619 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4402620 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

4402627 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4402628 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4402629 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4402630 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4402631 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4402632 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4402633 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4402634 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4402635 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4402636 i would like to acknowledge all the success of students across west norfolk and as far as kes is concerned we have had an excellent set of results with some outstanding individual results
4402637 its unfair to single out individual departments but 20 out of 22 departments had a 100 per cent pass rate
4402638 i had applied to cambridge so i needed three as you hope you get them but when you receive the results it is totally different to get five is beyond my expectations
4402639 i feel great it couldnt have gone much better and im dead pleased im going out for a meal with my parents to celebrate probably with a bit of bubbly so it should be nice
4402640 i was really happy to see that my hard work had paid off in the end i dont think the exams are becoming easier
4402641 i think more effort is being put in by students and teachers and the quality of teaching may have got better i put in a lot of work and did months of revision
4402642 overall they have done extremely well and we are very pleased we have seen good steady progress on the whole and have consolidated on a very respectable performance over the last few years
4402643 i was really not expecting to get as good as i got but i was hoping i just started crying and was quite shocked
4402644 i will be going out to celebrate as over the last two years there has been a lot of hard work
4402645 they are pretty much as expected i hoped for four as and was expecting three it is a massive relief
4402646 i was relieved more than anything it has taken two years of hard work and it is such a relief to finally get them
4402647 this is another good year of results which is testament to the hard work of our students and staff and the support of parents
4402648 performance in vocational areas has been especially strong and we are particularly delighted with the two students whose performance placed them in the top ten for engineering in the country we wish our students all the best for their future
4402649 this reflects their hard work and commitment and the high quality of teaching and learning in our college i would like to congratulate all our students and staff
4402650 we are pleased with the 16 subjects achieving a 100 per cent pass rate and particularly pleased that even more of our a level students achieved higher a to c grades compared to last year as this means more students will be accepted into their first choice of college or university as well as having better job opportunities
4402651 we have a small sixth form with only 90 students in total so we have small teaching groups which really pays off as it helps students achieve their potential
4402652 we had significant staff illnesses this year and some students had to teach themselves at times so this is a great achievement we are very pleased
4402653 we have really maintained what we got from last year and have significantly bettered the target grades of students the majority have exceeded their targets
4402654 we are really really pleased for them and they have been in all morning celebrating with us this is testament to the hard work of students staff and parents
4402655 once again the sixth form has allowed our students some of whom would not be allowed to study a levels at other sixth forms to take a significant step forward with their lives
4402656 we are delighted that so many students will gain places at their first choice of university every year our sixth form is growing in size and the challenge will be to sustain our high performance were enjoying that challenge
4402657 every student who wanted to go to university has got in and the results are an improvement on last year certainly
4402658 i am so pleased for the students who have put in so much work and can now go on to do the university courses they wanted to do
4402659 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4402660 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4402661 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4402662 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4402663 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4402664 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4402665 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4402666 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4402667 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4402668 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4402669 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4402670 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4402671 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4402672 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4402673 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4402674 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4402675 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4402676 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4402677 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4402678 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4402679 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4402680 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4402681 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4402682 who are open to doing something on the production side
4402683 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4402684 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4402685 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4402686 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4402687 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4402688 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4402689 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4402690 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4402691 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4402692 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4402693 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4402694 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4402695 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4402696 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4402697 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4402698 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4402699 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4402700 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4402701 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4402702 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4402703 el respeto di logo colaboraci n y apertura a todos los sectores deportivos
4402704 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4402705 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4402706 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4402707 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

4402733 this year the sales tax holiday is sure to be much needed and much appreciated by families shopping for school clothes and fall wardrobes
4402734 the main benefit is the tax savings on top of the fact that retailers have aggressive promotions
4402735 the holiday is always a good incentive to bring shoppers back downtown and take advantage of great offers that a lot of the stores have
4402736 downtown has everything from national retailers like bass shoes factory outlet chicos izod van heusen and a number of independents like douglas mens store footsies ha bas cruz cortez intima boutique nefertiti and many more
4402737 were expecting big crowds for the holiday weekend especially with gas prices right now

4402814 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy

4402820 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects

4402822 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4402823 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that

4402827 had thought a great deal about the potential of the vice presidency carter talked at length about how he saw the office as a wasted national asset he was determined to use his vice presidency in a way no president had done previously
4402828 made it clear to carter that he did not want to be considered if it was to be a strictly ceremonial office he was only interested in a truly substantive role
4402829 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4402830 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4402831 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4402832 if someone wants to discuss changes to that theyre going to have to bring that up with us

4402835 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4402836 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
4402837 has been very very difficult for the city and for the state
4402838 i sort of remember looking at it and thinking someones got to do something about this
4402839 to my complete surprise and shock people were obeying my traffic signals
4402840 there were all kinds of impromptu block parties that happened all over the city restaurants did their best to accommodate their customers when something like a blackout occurs people generally are going to pitch together and help out everyone else it sounds kinda hokey but its the truth
4402841 the price of gasoline in the last year has had a bigger impact on peoples thoughts about conservation than the blackout
4402842 we never found in much of the research we had done that there was a direct connection between the big blackout and issues around using too much or too little energy
4402843 i think people are creatures of habit to some degree and i dont think theres any lingering effects in reduced consumption from the blackout
4402844 the individual customers out there i believe want to help
4402845 to me it was the blackout day that got me thinking more and more about the environment and everything ive been doing it was just amazing how much we could get done without electricity and we actually enjoyed having no power
4402846 there were a few things that wouldve been nice like having the hot water tank working but for everything else we became creative we started having fondue
4402847 it can be contagious if you know one person doing something then another is more likely to start doing it as well and so it creates a chain reaction
4402848 environmental problems have been ongoing for a very long time but now im seeing that people are taking it seriously and i think its only going to increase probably exponentially over the next little while
4402849 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4402850 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4402851 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4402852 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000

4402855 ive lent my crystal ball to someone so i cant give you the figure

4402862 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4402863 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4402864 i think these ballots need to be up in tallahassee now so whatever needs to be done can be done quickly
4402865 der er ikke tale om en humanit r katastrofe men folk er bange og der er ingen friske forsyninger af friske f devarer som gr ntsager og br d og mange t r ikke spise den d semad russerne bringer ind til dem
4402866 de er bange for at der er gift i rationerne
4402867 the mayor made crime mapping a key manifesto commitment and it is an integral part of our strategy to make london safer
4402868 it is a proven technique for increasing public safety and putting extra resources into crime hotspots where they are most needed
4402869 the software development will enhance the service that we currently provide regarding the number rate and geographical location of defined crime types within the capital
4402870 the electronic crime maps will sit alongside the crime statistics that are published monthly on a ward borough and pan london basis
4402871 the new licensing laws were intended to give local people more of a say on how pubs and clubs are run in their area but when it comes to lapdancing establishments councils often find there is little they can do to respond to peoples wishes
4402872 many local authorities have added their voice to growing calls for an end to licensing of lapdancing clubs as cafes
4402873 current licensing has acted as a floodgate to the industry whilst making it difficult for local authorities and local people to have a say in this process
4402874 it has helped normalise la dancing clubs and attitudes that encourage seeing women as sex objects not people
4402875 the solution to this problem does not lie in tinkering with the licensing act 2003 or in planning controls the solution lies in licensing lapdancing clubs for what they are venues that provide visual entertainment for sexual stimulation in other words sex encounter establishments
4402876 we call on the government to restore democracy to the licensing process and send out a powerful message that buying a lapdance is not the same as buying a cappuccino
4402877 a lax licensing regime has led to the proliferation of lapdancing clubs in uk
4402878 straitjacketed by the licensing act 2003 local authorities have been powerless to stop the spread
4402879 they are compelled to license lapdance clubs like cafes despite having a very different social impact
4402880 lapdance clubs fuel a sexist culture of treating women as sex objects areas surrounding lapdance clubs can become no go areas for women
4402881 the only viable solution is to license lapdancing clubs as sex encounter establishments
4402882 for us to be anywhere close to double digits represented a huge change from the past
4402883 now in august weve had two new polls one showing about a 6 point lead one a 7 point lead
4402884 but franklin said there has been a shift statewide in party identification
4402885 so the upshot of that is theres been a shift in party balance over the last four years that could be very important to the state and democratic candidates in the state
4402886 i think the polls that come out a week or two after the conventions are going to be critical for telling us whether were going to be again one of these competitive swing states or whether the state has shifted enough that one candidate or the other will maintain a lead
4402887 delegates will be compelled to sleep five and six and perhaps more in a room
4402888 and in a good many instances two delegates will have to occupy the same bed
4402889 the men here are less prosperous looking than those who gathered for the republican convention in chicago they more obviously represent the masses the farmer element is everywhere distinguishable the majority of the delegates come from the soil and they look it
4402890 the mccain campaign relies on big money lobbyists and theyll rely on him
4402891 in the you scratch my back world of washington 931 million gets the special interests the best government money can buy but just think of the payday these lobbyists might expect in a mccain administration
4402892 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4402893 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4402894 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4402895 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
4402896 as the 19th century came to a close the american electorate changed more and more rapidly
4402897 a military force serving the interests of the democratic party
4402898 revive the dead and hateful race and sectional animosities in any part of our common country
4402899 means confusion distraction of business and the reopening of wounds now happily healed
4402900 when i use a word humpty dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less
4402901 with the election of harry truman democrats began the fight to bring down the final barriers of race
4402902 democrats began to bring down the final barriers of race
4402903 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4402904 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4402905 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4402906 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4402907 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4402908 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4402909 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4402910 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4402911 once again corporate decisions to put one of the worst in charge are costing chronicle readers one of the best
4402912 dir a que lo que me interesa en el teatro es que no hay r plica posible cuando cae el tel n te vas una pieza deber a tener esa cualidad no poderla replicar
4402913 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4402914 this is being done in a friendly and straightforward way
4402915 it is also all about what we can do to reduce our carbon footprint and greenhouse gases
4402916 these are all small things and they all add up
4402917 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
4402918 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
4402919 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4402920 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4402921 someone driving to work goes past a petrol station and sees petrol at a bargain price and thinks you beauty but when they drive home its gone up 10c a litre it makes people very angry
4402922 australians dont want that great volatility in prices but nor do they want to pay more for their petrol to do away with it
4402923 the government wants to see an end to the days when you drive past a petrol station in the morning and see a certain price and drive past in the afternoon and see a price 10c or 15c a litre higher
4402924 i just dont think its going to do what its meant to do
4402925 they have been enabled by indifference and helplessness of administrative and law enforcement bodies tolerated by the public as well as some politicians
4402926 we demand that representatives of our society presented as a democratic rule change their attitudes we have laws that protect the rights of decent people their safety and freedom we demand that they are consistently fulfilled to make us feel trust in democracy again
4402927 theres certainly more of a wild west atmosphere here than there will ever be in vancouver
4402928 i havent walked through a mall yet where i havent seen multiple store windows that are doing things that would hit a sponsors radar and raise concern
4402929 we look under the pillows and look under the sofas
4402930 we masked the name of the other company as best we could in these cases you try to be reasonable but you often have to use tape it happens quite a bit
4402931 when i walk through a venue now its such a different thing if im with my wife she comments on the architecture and i comment on the brand of the security system
4402932 you have a lot of pre existing advertising at these places that will have to be covered up for the olympics bocog beijings organizing committee doesnt have that problem
4402933 the tv cameras might pan to a prominent reporter during an event or a press conference so if that might put a big backlit apple logo in the shot and the event is sponsored by lenovo you want to try to prevent that
4402934 or remain at the back or in a storage facility
4402935 but if you start to layer in other elements theres a threshold at which it becomes damaging in the sponsorship category
4402936 you should not be able to leverage the good will of the games to your benefit without paying for it and thats really what were protecting against
4402937 ive been seeing the look and the graphics of the games around beijing and the scope and scale of what theyve managed to do here is enormous
4402938 i think it is very brave of him to come back to the shura after what he has been through
4402939 he was beaten very badly but still he attends the shura
4402940 our people are very innocent we dont have anything in our hands like a machine gun to protect ourselves
4402941 when the insurgents come to know that we have meetings with the foreign people they kidnap us they kill us
4402942 if we can convince locals that what their government offers is a better situation than what the insurgents offer and if the locals can be convinced thats a fact then they can beat this insurgency
4402943 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
4402944 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4402945 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4402946 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4402947 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4402948 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4402949 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
4402950 considering what the current neo con president has actually succeeded in doing to the balance of power between the branches which far supasses fdrs now feeble looking attempts
4402951 bush has gotten away with dispicable acts that any civilized democracy should not tolerate
4402952 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4402953 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4402954 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4402955 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
4402956 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
4402957 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
4402958 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
4402959 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
4402960 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
4402961 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
4402962 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
4402963 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
4402964 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
4402965 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
4402966 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
4402967 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
4402968 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
4402969 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
4402970 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4402971 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4402972 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4402973 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4402974 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4402975 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4402976 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4402977 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4402978 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4402979 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4402980 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4402981 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4402982 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4402983 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4402984 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4402985 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4402986 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
4402987 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how
4402988 remember that it was the democrats who created the kkk as their political action wing they were the same ones who kept segregation going with george wallace leading the fight democrats fought against the emancipation proclamation womens right to vote civil rights and the list goes on martin luther king was a registered republican they use the same plays that they did against lincoln same rhetoric it is amazing these are all facts that the dems dont want you to know they are purpetually reworking history it is proven that most of what they blame on republicans is actually what they are doing or have done
4402989 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4402990 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4402991 was consistently within the top 5 of his class as a whole
4402992 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4402993 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4402994 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4402995 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4402996 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4402997 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4402998 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4402999 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4403000 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4403001 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4403002 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4403003 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4403004 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4403005 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4403006 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4403007 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4403008 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4403009 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4403010 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4403011 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4403012 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4403013 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4403014 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4403015 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4403016 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4403017 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4403018 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4403019 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4403020 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4403021 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4403022 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama
4403023 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
4403024 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4403025 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4403026 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4403027 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4403028 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4403029 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4403030 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4403031 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4403032 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4403033 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4403034 the last eight years have been nothing short of a disaster
4403035 we need a new start not only domestically but internationally
4403036 i am very delighted to see that the obamas campaign has reached out to many community activists from all asian american and pacific islander communities including those who erstwhile were ardent supporters of hillary clinton and john edwards
4403037 is from a new generation of leaders as immigrants to this country we can easily identify ourselves with his life story he is an inspiration for our children born here that is perhaps the reason why so many of young generation indian americans have flocked to his campaign obama has also surrounded himself with many political veterans of indian origin
4403038 each of these individuals are deeply committed to ensuring that the rapidly growing south asian american communities are engaged and participating in this years historic elections
4403039 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
4403040 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
4403041 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
4403042 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
4403043 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
4403044 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
4403045 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
4403046 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
4403047 for climate changes he glosses over that this local planetary system is in constant change and we cant accurately measure the recent relatively small changes and anthropogenic contributions are an open question
4403048 how would the developers in this audience feel if the news media were opining on the benefits of one programming language over another and other people with no knowledge of programming were making strong statements based on what theyd read or heard in the media
4403049 im curious robert whether you are also skeptical about evolution that would be a good litmus test of whether this is a political religious disagreement or a scientific one
4403050 right now your choices are between the scientists who are actually conducting the research and analysis and pundits who are opining on something that they have no data research or proper science to support
4403051 most scientists think that global warming is an issue i think its bunk
4403052 there no agreement among scientists that weather patterns are changing as a result of human activity
4403053 look they are saying there may be the equivalent of war crimes trials one day
4403054 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4403055 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4403056 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4403057 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4403058 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4403059 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4403060 both games against york last season we put in very good performances so were looking forward to it
4403061 grad missile artillery mortar and machinegun fire has been reported dozens of blasts shatter the city every minute tens of armored vehicles and thousands of soldiers moved into the conflict zone
4403062 the ex soviet republic of georgia and its invasion over the last two days of the russian population of south ossetia the second half of north ossetia inside the russian federation looks to be linked to georgias breathtaking increases in its defense spending over the last few years and it looks set to beat all records this year in 2008 alone so far they are over 1 billion usd of gdp the fourth largest in eurasia in late june of 2006 the georgian government increased the defense ministrys budget of 513 million laris 315 million us dollars by 442 million laris 260 million dollars and the money arms and military training is not from a new growing economy its from the us taxpayer the pentagon and nato along with the usaid and yes the other nato aspirant ukraine
4403063 georgia has received 206 tanks of which 175 units were supplied by nato states 186 armored vehicles 126 from nato 79 guns 67 from nato 25 helicopters 12 from nato 70 mortars ten surface to air missile systems eight israeli made unmanned aircraft and other weapons in addition nato countries have supplied four combat aircraft to georgia the russian defense ministry said there were plans to deliver to georgia 145 armored vehicles 262 guns and mortars 14 combat aircraft including four mirazh 2000 destroyers 25 combat helicopters 15 american black hawk aircraft six surface to air missile systems and other arms
4403064 israel began selling arms to georgia about seven years ago following an initiative by georgian citizens who immigrated to israel and became businesspeople
4403065 they contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing israeli weapons
4403066 the military cooperation between the countries developed swiftly the fact that georgias defense minister davit kezerashvili is a former israeli who is fluent in hebrew contributed to this cooperation
4403067 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
4403068 compared to countries in eastern europe the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly due to the defense ministers personal involvement
4403069 in addition to the trainers 1 000 soldiers from the vicenza italy based southern european task force airborne and the kaiserslautern based 21st theater sustainment command along with marine reservists with the 3rd battalion 25th marines out of ohio and the state of georgias army national guards 1st battalion 121st infantry participated in
4403070 operation immediate response 2008 was held from july 15 july 30 with u s personnel training about 600 troops at a former soviet base near tbilisi the largest city and capital of georgia the goal of this operation was allegedly teaching combat skills for missions in iraq the marines left already the country but not the airmen
4403071 south ossetia was a trap and putin took the bait unfortunately for bush the wily russian prime minister is considerably brighter than anyone in the current administration bushs plan will undoubtedly backfire and disrupt the geopolitical balance of power the world might get that breather from the us after all
4403072 georgian forces and separatists in south ossetia agree to observe a ceasefire and hold russian mediated talks to end their long simmering conflict
4403073 hours later georgian forces launch a surprise attack sending a large force against the breakaway province and reaching the capital tskhinvali
4403074 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
4403075 russias goals in embarking on the war in georgia were twofold
4403076 no one in georgia or a western capital doubts that moscows lightning retaliation when georgian forces launched their surprise attack on the south ossetian capital was long planned
4403077 mr saakashvili ignored western warnings including those from the us secretary of state condoleeza rice not to respond to russian provocation but in the end he fell into the russian trap by ordering an ill planned strike while the eyes of the world were on the olympics he cannot have anticipated the overwhelming response from the nuclear power across the border involving massive firepower from tanks warplanes and battle hardened russian soldiers
4403078 but mr saakashvilis headstrong and impulsive behaviour sic in the crisis following his disastrous crackdown on demonstrators last november has eroded western support
4403079 perhaps the biggest mystery though is why georgia decided to take on russia now of course the situation had long been profoundly unsatisfactory from georgias point of view south ossetia and abkhazia were outside its control and undisguised platforms for russian trouble making
4403080 russias barely contested military sweep into georgia was a flexing of its muscles that leaves it undisputed master of the region once again
4403081 our 14 offices are part of a highly structured volunteer heavy plan to win in new hampshire
4403082 we are creating neighborhood teams with volunteers who are trained equipped and empowered to build a campaign organization in their own neighborhood
4403083 i think weve built on that grass roots effort from 2004
4403084 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
4403085 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
4403086 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
4403087 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
4403088 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4403089 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4403090 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4403091 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4403092 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4403093 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4403094 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4403095 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4403096 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4403097 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4403098 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4403099 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4403100 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4403101 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4403102 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4403103 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4403104 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4403105 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4403106 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4403107 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4403108 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4403109 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4403110 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4403111 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4403112 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4403113 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4403114 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4403115 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4403116 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4403117 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4403118 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4403119 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4403120 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4403121 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4403122 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4403123 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4403124 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4403125 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4403126 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4403127 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4403128 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4403129 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4403130 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4403131 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4403132 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4403133 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4403134 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4403135 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4403136 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4403137 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4403138 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4403139 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4403140 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4403141 hola mart n speaks directly to the needs and concerns of our demographic
4403142 hola martin speaks directly to the needs and concerns of our demographic young hispanics who tune in to be both entertained and educated about topics not addressed on other spanish language talk radio programs
4403143 radiocadenas hola martin offers marketers a powerful outlet for reaching hispanics on air on site and online
4403144 from our conversations with our international counterparts in new york milan and paris it has become clear that they do not recognize the need for an international health certificate
4403145 there is now a major awareness on health in the industry and through cfdas continued programs there had been a real coming together with an emphasis on health as beauty
4403146 from our conversations with our international counterparts in new york milan and paris it has become clear that they do not recognize the need for an international health certificate
4403147 there is now a major awareness on health in the industry and through cfdas continued programs there had been a real coming together with an emphasis on health as beauty
4403148 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4403149 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4403150 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4403151 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4403152 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4403153 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4403154 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4403155 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4403156 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4403157 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4403158 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4403159 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4403160 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4403161 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4403162 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4403163 like the dawn exceedingly resplendent hast thou come into the world o mary when thou didst foreshow the splendor of the true sun by such a wonderful radiance of sanctity that truly the day of salvation the day of propitiation the day which the lord hath made was worthy to be begun by thy bright light
4403164 didst thou show the dawning of the day its place
4403165 his place is in peace and his dwelling in zion
4403166 follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see god
4403167 if there are in you any bowels of piety or mercy consider with what love was crucified with what desire this virgin burned while she revolved in her soul all that she had heard and seen all that she had known with what emotions she was moved being filled with the holy ghost with the thrilling knowledge of heavenly secrets
4403168 the river which came forth from the paradise of pleasure jesus christ from the virgins womb was to water the garden
4403169 i saw her coming up beautiful from the banks of the water
4403170 the priests brought in the ark of the covenant into its place
4403171 neither was there in the world a more worthy place than the bridal chamber of the virginal womb in which mary received the son of god nor in the heavens one more worthy than the royal throne to which the son of mary raised her
4403172 you know dave youre the most famous youtuber ive ever met
4403173 christian bourne hes not as famous as you yet but he will do hes got what it takes
4403174 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4403175 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4403176 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4403177 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4403178 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4403179 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4403180 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4403181 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4403182 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4403183 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4403184 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4403185 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4403186 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4403187 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4403188 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
4403189 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
4403190 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
4403191 getting the data out of the device and into the control system usually uses proprietary software that is not interoperable across platforms
4403192 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4403193 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4403194 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4403195 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4403196 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4403197 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4403198 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4403199 bridges to nowhere than the one in alaska and there are more builders of such bridges than those built by alaskas defendant senator
4403200 he pasado toda la noche en gori la ciudad es patrullada por las fuerzas de ocupaci n rusas la situaci n es de calma
4403201 los rusos prometieron que hoy permitir n el paso de ayuda humanitaria
4403202 i can tell you from my experience that most of the time media speculation turns out to be wrong
4403203 im staying as governor whether you like it or not
4403204 the lieutenant governor might not like it very much but im staying
4403205 between one candidate john mccain who has always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
4403206 i want them to know i am sorry it has taken a great toll on them
4403207 somewhere along the way i lost my path i made horrible decisions
4403208 this is a sad case its obvious that you have good skills
4403209 you destroyed the most valuable asset that you possess your good name
4403210 he was not saying oh im sorry i was arrested
4403211 his crime wasnt just ripping people off hes left a trail of devastation in his wake boarded up buildings are going to stay that way for years to come thats what hes done for his community
4403212 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
4403213 the royal we i had a vodka tonic and called it quits you got so shitfaced you puked on my jacket and then attempted to fornicate with it
4403214 we knew they were out there so we thought wed start a design center
4403215 garbage collectors would inspect san francisco residents trash to make sure pizza crusts arent mixed in with chip bags or wine bottles under a proposal by mayor gavin newsom
4403216 jimmy i dont want you playing with the williams boys anymore their family doesnt recycle
4403217 we now live in a society where sunday church attendance is down but people wouldnt dream of missing their weekly trek to the altar of the recycling center

4403219 radio serves you meatloaf and you know theres steak back in the kitchen
4403220 the scale of the casualties of the war as devastating as they are today was greater back then in vietnam
4403221 plus there was a draft young people then and now are consumers of popular music and there would have been more urgency back then about current events and that would be felt in the kind of music theyd be demanding
4403222 people want to be able to escape when they go into a movie theater put on their ear buds or pick up a trash novel were the stakes higher it wouldnt be as easy to simply escape and you might see more willingness to engage things that address the state of the world
4403223 it causes radio to become more of a mirror rather than a leader
4403224 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word
4403225 why would any musician whos ambitious care about what radio stations think theyre not stupid they know radio stations wont play something controversial college public and satellite radio might play it though the other interesting thing about this is that even the toby keith jingoistic material is at a minimum
4403226 in my business theres a term called being dixie chick ed
4403227 ashamed the president of the united states is from texas
4403228 every single radio station that we gave handlebars to their initial reaction was oh hell no
4403229 even if some artists might support the war or mccain it would be an unpopular decision to say so and that translates into what youre seeing in music right now a lot of fear
4403230 i hear it all the time on a consumer level a lot of people are getting fed up with the type of music being played
4403231 they played the song once and theyd get a flood of phone calls
4403232 the stations are still after ratings but there are songs that will come through and will alter whats acceptable and push the boundaries id be very surprised if we didnt start seeing more of this
4403233 anti war music has come and gone in waves over the past few years
4403234 while it was easy to believe that artists had been scared into silence many just needed a year or two to get an album out similarly a lot of songs with references to hurricane katrina are just coming out now so we could indeed have the next big statement sitting as a demo on some artists laptop as we speak
4403235 the thoroughbred who leads too early and by too great a margin is more often than not the vulnerable one the one in danger of losing it all to the horse who strategically holds back waits and then thunders in the final furlongs to finish first
4403236 wake up youre liberal how we can take america back from the right
4403237 i want to pay tribute to the whole team for representing gb so well
4403238 i know how disappointed the players are not to be able to bring home the medal we all so desperately wanted but it wasnt for the want of trying
4403239 the passion and commitment has been so evident not just during the games but through an intensive 15 month period of qualification and preparation
4403240 i am so proud of the players coaches and support team and after a break we will reflect and consider how best to build for success in london in four years
4403241 our olympic unit is fully aware that although our campaign was innovative and thorough it has still not achieved the desired results
4403242 the challenge ahead is to do all in our power to achieve those desired results in 2012
4403243 so have you finished playing shop for a while now
4403244 det r dags att f slut p den h r krisen
4403245 mal einen anderen sieger vorstellen aber man muss loeb zugestehen dass er diese rallye wie seine westentasche kennt au erdem scheinen die pr fungen perfekt auf sein auto zugeschnitten zu sein
4403246 etwas besonderes seit es den deutschen wm lauf gibt hat ihn noch nie jemand anderes gewonnen als ich und das soll gef lligst auch so bleiben
4403247 ausgerechnet bei der rallye zur ckschlagen zu lassen die uns besonders gut liegt
4403248 damit k nnten wir unseren titelambitionen einen ordentlichen schub geben
4403249 ich will loeb das gleiche antun was er mir angetan hat obwohl asphalt nicht mein spezialbelag ist will ich mich f r die niederlage in finnland revanchieren
4403250 in diesem jahr sitze ich im weltmeisterauto und kann hoffentlich an meine guten ergebnisse bei dieser rallye ankn pfen
4403251 das ist das was wir brauchen irgendwann musste das ja mal kommen mit sieben jahren hat das ja lange genug gedauert
4403252 ich hoffe dass uns das jetzt auch da weiter hilft wo wir es brauchen bei der suche nach sponsoren
4403253 das ist eine u erst ungl ckliche entscheidung nicht optimal f r die ganze wm
4403254 genauso wichtig wie der sieg ist es mir dass ich kampf und willen gezeigt habe
4403255 ich hatte mir den wecker auf 7 25 uhr gestellt aber um zwei uhr bin ich wach geworden und konnte schlecht wieder einschlafen um halb sieben war ich dann komplett wach und habe gelesen als wir in die halle einmarschiert sind lief alles wie in trance
4403256 aus dem zappeligen m dchen ist eine toughe erwachsene frau geworden
4403257 das war unfassbar ein unglaubliches rennen wie sie das noch gewonnen hat ist fantastisch
4403258 sagte vesper nach dem ersten olympiasieg f r den deutschen schwimm verband dsv seit dagmar hases triumph 1992 in barcelona
4403259 britta hat sich nicht aus der ruhe bringen lassen und am ende ihre st rken ausgespielt
4403260 brittas gro e leistung ist nur ein pflaster auf die wunde des dsv nach olympia muss man das pflaster abrei en und schauen wie gro die wunde wirklich ist
4403261 nat rlich sind wir extrem entt uscht aber eine allenfalls mittelm ige leistung reicht bei olympia halt nicht aus
4403262 erkl rte dieckmann der bei olympia 2004 in athen mit andreas scheuerpflug noch platz f nf belegt hatte
4403263 wir hatten hier so hohe erwartungen und wollten um die medaillen spielen aber wir sind nie richtig frei im kopf geworden
4403264 die olympischen spiele sind wundersch n es m ssten aber auch motorradrennen zugelassen werden die motorr der sollten f r alle olympia teilnehmer gleich sein
4403265 die formel 1 ist ein technischer sport die olympischen spiele sind mehr f r athleten
4403266 stellen sie sich nur mal einen super fahrer vor wie fr her michael schumacher der w rde dann in einem ferrari f r deutschland k mpfen
4403267 sagte die ehemalige doppel weltmeisterin die nach 2000 ihr zweites olympisches team gold gewann
4403268 unser plan ist aufgegangen die pferde waren auf den punkt topfit
4403269 sagte heike kemmer und lobte die anderen goldreiterinnen ber den gr nen klee
4403270 das war die beste qualifikationsleistung meiner karriere ich f hle mich lockerer als je zuvor jetzt m chte ich meine platzierung von athen verbessern
4403271 ich habe mich heute fr h gef hlt als w re ein laster ber mich gefahren ich h tte aber auch mit dem arm unterm kopf geworfen
4403272 das bisher ausgehandelte ist gut f r den spieler aber noch nicht das was wir wollen

4403491 the third quarter was a successful period with remarkable financial performance and significant business developments for sinoenergy we continued our strong growth with record quarterly revenue resulting mostly from the rapid growth of our cng equipment manufacturing business the successful disposal of gpi provided us with a good return on investment and additional capital to devote to developing our cng processing plants and filling station network
4403492 we restructured our subsidiaries along business functions and our qingdao sinogas subsidiary benefited from an 18 million dollar investment a portion of which will be used to establish a new production line for steel containers
4403493 shortly after the end of the quarter we began trading on the nasdaq capital market an important step in increasing our presence in the investment community
4403494 we feel confident that our cng station equipment business conversion kits business and non standard pressure container businesses will continue their robust growth in the fourth quarter of our 2008 fiscal year our working capital together with cash flow generated from our operations provides us with the funds necessary to continue developing our retail cng filling station business

4403498 in the end we felt it was more appropriate to honor the el caminos unique place as part of chevys heritage and not use that nameplate on a pontiac
4403499 the addition of this dramatically designed sport wagon is well synchronized with todays changing consumer tastes as a compelling alternative to suvs or other larger vehicles
4403500 this is an important step in cadillacs ongoing global expansion and of course in international markets like europe wagons have been and continue to be very significant
4403501 the cts sport wagon is an important expansion to the cadillac lineup worldwide
4403502 its a taut design that not only suggests sleekness but delivers it
4403503 indeed the drama of the sedan is amplified in the cts sport wagon as the centerline cue that is part of the exterior and interior is more prominent and plays a stronger role in defining the design at the rear of the vehicle
4403504 the more you study the rear of the cts sport wagon the more you see
4403505 functionality was certainly a guiding factor during development but so was the idea to inject emotion into the normally sedate wagon category
4403506 theyre not fins in the classic sense but they work to help disguise the cargo load system and yes they acknowledge cadillacs design heritage

4403636 it is possible that some unknown environmental factor is the cause of current health problems and of gulf war syndrome
4403637 but it is also possible that these symptoms result from the stress of military deployment especially prolonged and multiple deployments
4403638 women now comprise approximately 15 percent of our nations armed forces and since the persian gulf war combat roles for women have expanded substantially
4403639 this study is an attempt to understand the impact of deployment and war related stressors on the health of military women
4403640 by identifying problems early i hope our findings will guide policy makers and health care professions to design interventions to support service members and their families

4403646 the first flight was a success and made the first in situ measurements of gases in a volcanic plume using meteorological balloons
4403647 the balloons are piloted remotely by satellite link with flight visualization using google earth we were looking at tropospheric volcanic emissions of sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide and water which can be hazardous to human and animal health and degrade ecosystems
4403648 the stratification could represent separation of the gases through meteorological processes such as water droplet formation
4403649 we connected the dots to draw a critical conclusion and found evidence over the amazon that traces the direct path of the effect of human activity on climate change by way of human caused aerosols
4403650 during the dry season in the amazon the only aerosols of any magnitude are from smoke emerging from human initiated fires
4403651 we saw an example of this ourselves increased aerosols over the amazon produced less cloud cover over the atlantic ocean however increased aerosols actually produced more cloud cover
4403652 we wanted to know what the link was between these different outcomes from varying amounts and types of aerosols this paper gives us a clear picture of what is occurring
4403653 this result helps us understand aerosols effect on a clouds mass and lifetime how long it will provide cloud cover how deep the clouds will be and when and where it will rain
4403654 this improved understanding leads to prediction and prediction can help us plan and perhaps prevent some of the potential consequences of putting aerosols from human activity into the atmosphere
4403655 if the himalayan glaciers recede the flow of water in our sacred rivers will go down climate change can disrupt our economy in several ways some of our coastal areas could be submerged our monsoon pattern may change we need long term solutions to such threats a national consensus is also required for the government to evolve effective policies to deal with these problems
4403656 each of us must adapt our ways of working and living and how we must treat our natural resources so that our carbon emissions remain within reasonable limits and our environment is protected
4403657 india will engage actively in multilateral negotiations in the un framework convention on climate change unfcc in a positive constructive and forward looking manner

4403659 i appeal to all political parties to keep the long term interests of jammu and kashmir in view and come together to find a permanent solution to the problems of the state the sacred shrine of shri amar nath inspires all indians to march together this shrine is a shining example of our secular tradition where hindu pilgrims have been looked after for years by their muslim brothers
4403660 issues related to this sacred place especially the issue of providing the best possible facilities to pilgrims can only be resolved in an atmosphere of peace and goodwill dividing people in the name of religion can complicate these issues further which can also pose a threat to the unity and integrity of the country
4403661 it is my conviction that all issues can be resolved only through dialogue and peaceful means
4403662 we are investing in infrastructure and in education in these regions to encourage development and generate employment jammu and kashmir and the north eastern region require an era of peace for them to catch up with the more developed parts of the country we have been taking various initiatives to promote peace and stability in these states these initiatives will be taken forward
4403663 i am happy that the happenings in j k and especially the amarnath controversy found a place in the prime ministers speech but i would have been happier if a resolution had been expressed to do something about the disgrace that has befallen our country

4403669 ive lost my faith in marriage most of my generation their parents are divorced as are mine and i see so many people break up

4403675 enceladus was streaking across the sky so quickly that the spacecraft had no hope of tracking any feature on its surface
4403676 our best option was to point the spacecraft far ahead of enceladus spin the spacecraft and camera as fast as possible in the direction of enceladus predicted path and let enceladus overtake us at a time when we could match its motion across the sky snapping images along the way

4403694 come on i know them lets do it lets do it together
4403695 pero el gobierno federal debe otorgar m s recursos presupuestales
4403696 tenemos la capacidad y podemos facturar un mismo recibo de voz y datos adem s de la luz
4403697 que no son ni de aqu ni de all y que habr que pasarlos al bando de los buenos

4403699 no s lo por asuntos internos ni un grupo de supervisores
4403700 cuando aflore el problema habr que ver qu pasa con el superior porque quiere decir que cuando eso se repite abajo el mando no est funcionando no sabe lo que pasa o est coludido en ese caso se va el de abajo y tambi n el de arriba
4403701 en el caso de las recompensas se dar n cuando se compruebe que la informaci n es verdadera y permita detener delincuentes o desmantelar bandas delictivas
4403702 hasta cierto punto porque si no c mo se cobra la recompensa
4403703 unas con conciencia y otras sin conciencia creyendo que est n dando informaci n buena y no es as
4403704 para atender cosas inexistentes y se pierde la oportunidad de acudir a otros lugares donde alguien lo necesita
4403705 si tanto le pedimos a la autoridad como ciudadanos tenemos que hacer lo propio
4403706 eso va en detrimento no del polic a ni del bombero sino de la ciudadan a
4403707 ser un elemento brutal para la supervisi n porque no hay mejor que la de los ciudadanos

4403709 what are the benefits of your breaking that window many you calm yourself down the enclosure gets lighter and cooler the poisons rise a little off the floor the intensity lessens and the people you are looking for have a little more time for you to find them

4403716 hes come into the sanfl cold if you like twice this year ive seen him live and i liked the way he handled it
4403717 im a great believer that guys who can handle that speed at sanfl and perform reasonably well are not too far away from being able to play afl footy
4403718 weve watched him closely throughout the year and hes in better than good form hes in exceptional form
4403719 telstra dome suits a lot of the qualities he possesses and just with the injuries and the set ups weve got at the moment he does give us a degree of flexibility
4403720 its an unusual story but its a good story and im sure it will be exciting for our fans
4403721 from memory the last time they played us here might have been the last half of their previous game against richmond that they changed their game
4403722 they became a little bit more defensive minded or added a bit more defence to their game and they have continued to do that they are probably much better balanced now than they were earlier in the year
4403723 we think the recovery will be shaped more like a nike swoosh with gradual improvement in 2009 and then steady progress into 2010 as our economic fundamentals regain solid footing
4403724 with costs rising energy shrinking and environmental concerns rising we have to respond quickly
4403725 we have to radically revamp our line ups create cleaner technology and work with others to develop new energy new fuelling stations and smarter roads
4403726 theres got to be an immense amount of change in the industry by the middle of the decade
4403727 we need to rollout more hybrids and continue to perfect ethanol clean diesel electric cars fuel cells and other alternatives

4403731 when you open an embassy in london it is a huge responsibility
4403732 before september 11 the international community didnt pay enough attention to the region
4403733 you know it is very old conflict which we have in that region and it is very difficult to make some comments
4403734 we know the current tragedy happening in south ossetia was initiated by georgian forces and there has been a reply from the russian forces but maybe it is not our competency to analyse who is guilty who is not
4403735 what is going on in ossetia is awful they should come back to the negotiation table in order to find a peaceful solution there was a very good proposal made by mr bush to get back to the positions according to the situation on 6 of august and there is a good proposal from russia for georgian forces to jump back to their positions before the clashes
4403736 during soviet period we were isolated from those countries iran and afghanistan and their people
4403737 but now after getting independence the situation is very different
4403738 but we only sell raw cotton we cannot reproduce it into different materials such as suits and jeans
4403739 we have good markets especially in afganistan in pakistan and in iran they are ready to buy a huge amount of our electricuty which might be produced in tajikistan such projects are just waiting for investors
4403740 we claim such activity in china is not to the benefit of stability and that it has bad influence in other parts of the region
4403741 such situations as in china or in other areas of the region may have an influence in other parts in uzbekistan for example
4403742 you should remember the events that took place in andijan
4403743 we have had the arab invasions the mongol invasions hopefully we can overcome the soviet period as well however today we are a sovereign and independent country of course we brought many things from the history of those times
4403744 but now the most important thing is to move forward and not what we left behind

4403764 op de terugtocht kon ik een aantal touwen niet vinden dat gebeurde op een heel gevaarlijk punt daarom heb ik daar met twee anderen een bivak ingericht en een nacht doorstaan de volgende morgen begonnen we opnieuw te zoeken ik bemerkte bij mezelf echter een begin van sneeuwblindheid dus ik heb besloten loodrecht naar beneden te gaan om meer zuurstof te krijgen door zuurstofgebrek werken je hersenen je ogen eigenlijk alles minder goed op puur geluk heb ik het touw teruggevonden later ging het opnieuw verkeerd dus ik ben weer een stukje omhoog geklommen voordat ik verder afdaalde

4403806 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defense system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia

4403809 kinder morgan bulk terminals is paying for its employees attempts to save money by illegally dumping materials at sea
4403810 todays sentencing reaffirms the departments commitment to protecting the worlds ocean resources and insuring a level playing field for corporations that follow the law
4403811 its hard to imagine a clearer violation of the ocean dumping act
4403812 intentionally using the ocean as a garbage can for off spec potash is not only morally wrong its a crime kinder morgan has paid a serious price for not taking care of this properly at the dock
4403813 this was a long and difficult investigation that started here in portland and ended in japan and was solved by the dogged diligence of criminal investigators at the environmental protection agency

4403821 ultimately because micron manufactures nand we are able to capitalize on our outstanding process technology well established ip and a deep commitment to forwarding nand memory to bring products like this to market in fact we also have the capability to pair e mmc devices with low power dram in multi chip packages mcps ultimately our recent move to the 34nm process was a major accomplishment and these product lines directly benefit from that innovation
4403822 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4403823 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4403824 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4403825 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4403826 as it stands this proposal leaves the russians in total control
4403827 there is nothing in here about the inviolability of georgias frontiers
4403828 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4403829 we are cleaning roads because we have information that there are some mines
4403830 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4403831 we have no beds six of us are sleeping on the floor we dont have anything left
4403832 that was the first time that i tried doing it i was all in
4403833 i dont believe ive ever seen that especially between two pitchers
4403834 i dont believe ive ever seen four in a row between two pitchers and that many runs given up in a one run ballgame with two outs
4403835 you see a lot of special things whether its a guy hitting his 500th home run this was more like you probably wont see it again you might see it once if you play the game for 10 or 15 years
4403836 the first two you dont feel it the third one is the one you start feeling it three in a row
4403837 carlos is a hit magnet the way he hits he stands over the plate
4403838 if carlos gets hit the way he gets hit i dont mind that but if he gets hit the way i dont think he should get hit then its a problem

4403843 they have to leave the shelter because we actually invited them at a time of need we think enough has been done to do that
4403844 we are also convinced that conditions exist in all the communities in gauteng for the displaced people to safely return to their places so we dont expect anybody to refuse to leave
4403845 its not safe theyre saying were going to kill them

4403850 we are so excited to finally get spore into the hands of fans and players
4403851 the maxis studio has had an absolute blast creating spore but the fun is just beginning the most engaging stories are truly the ones people create themselves and we cant wait to see how players not only craft and explore the spore universe but hear what stories they have to tell as a result
4403852 to a much wider group of people than would ever play a computer game
4403853 gamesindustry biz is one of my starting tabs when i boot up so its always one of the first sites i see each day its good being able to catch up with whats happened in the us overnight and in the uk before im awake first thing and know that the stories will be accurate and thought out
4403854 i made the play and i never felt anything pop
4403855 i took two steps back toward the mound and i was like what the heck just happened it got worse and worse and i came in here and it got worse now ive got this brace on and im good

4403858 that traditional trade would be affected if the north of england is brought into the vaccination zone before the regular calf sales take place this autumn
4403859 we believe the time is right to review the continued roll out of vaccine in england
4403860 if the current timetable in england is met there would be significant implications for calf producers in northumberland and cumbria who have traditionally supplied scottish finishers through the september and october sales
4403861 halting vaccination in the north would strike a balance between the economic considerations of trade disruption against those of necessary disease control
4403862 however the implications for trade and disease control are uk wide and it is appropriate that we feed into this debate
4403863 we are at the peak of midge activity and we can expect bluetongue to reach england at any time
4403864 there will be no impact on farmgate milk prices the farmgate price that we offer remains one of the best in the industry this is simply a function of competition between retailers
4403865 weve just started to see some success in getting the consumer to understand the quality of milk and that producers must get a decent return from the market why do this to a valued food product why not to washing up liquid or toilet rolls
4403866 theres no contradiction here freshnlo complements our existing range were just answering customers call for us to help them with the pain of higher food prices it wont affect tescos farmgate milk price or its direct supply group
4403867 i challenge the statement that this will have no impact on dairy farmers and i dont believe this wont affect farmgate milk prices its also very interesting this product is in wisemans name i would also question where wiseman is going to get cheaper milk from to supply this range

4403885 i read the obituaries first because i do family history but i saw the story on the front of the amherst daily news
4403886 i have a file of thousands of names that belong to the family and i recognized the names wylie was a little bit unusual its not a common name
4403887 some people think tracing your family history is a little morbid or kind of silly but its really exciting
4403888 it was obvious that she is a descendant in the pettigrew line
4403889 they found reference to the name henwood that i hadnt seen
4403890 they were pleasantly surprised at what was there and the condition of it
4403891 troy also recognized the background areas to some of the black and white photographs
4403892 its better than reading an actual history book really because its all there first hand in that persons handwriting the documents were well looked after whoever was looking after them over the years
4403893 the local museum would be more deserving than just one person because then everyone could take a look at the documents
4403894 its not uncommon for someone to find a letter here or there but not this much
4403895 its not that common for people to find this much history in one spot
4403896 at this time no occupational health and safety orders have been issued
4403897 the worker did sustain non life threatening injuries and is now at home recovering
4403898 the steel plate he was working with slipped resulting in him being injured
4403899 the appreciation and respect of descendants and cousins in katherines rescuing these documents for history goes to show that treasure is not to be measure in silver or gold but rather in the ancestral chains linking us back into canadas history through the ordinary lives of citizens
4403900 the number of people these records have touched is astounding but not surprising
4403901 this is a testament to mcneils spirit of preservation that she recognized and understood the value of these few pieces of paper and books for the many descendants

4403907 based on everything i know about it the so called new right in america is completely different from ours i dont see even a single point with which i could agree with this so called new right unfortunately the name we now have gives rise to many misunderstandings
4403908 the collapse of communism is not only a political victory for the american new world order but a moral triumph for the american way of life we can all now look forward to a future of unbridled consumption in which we will all be equal and free to buy the same things however there are those in europe who still value the roofed diversity of its peoples and all the qualities which make us more than mere units of consumption these people actually oppose the liberal capitalist system they want an organically rooted society instead of more disneylands and they flout accepted political convention by talking about transcending the old notions of left and right in a new synthesis of radical thought they are active in fields of culture and metapolitics waging a war of ideas they seek a european renaissance this attachment to identity is an inconvenience to the multinationals an insult to ronald mcdonald and a direct attack on coca colonization
4403909 anyone can go shopping for their size or colour this is more of a challenge getting what you want and what you need
4403910 its more of a thrill finding something that fits you perfectly or that the kids will love for only two or three dollars its money well spent because kids grow so fast and they constantly change their minds
4403911 if the clothes are there and have made it through someone elses kids then its going to last for my family
4403912 it gives them choices and keeps them busy well sort clothes into piles like maybe definitely yes and probably not ill tell them something like they get 6 or one item if they can find two things for 6 then thats good
4403913 a few of the regulars will come in tuesday and thursday afternoons theyll shop sit on the bench down back with their coffee and chat then shop again when the new clothing is brought out
4403914 i dont usually come here on the weekends but during the week the word frequently isnt strong enough
4403915 i used to come four times a week but with the price of gas now its only about twice
4403916 this is a question that is being tackled by several federations not just gymnastics
4403917 this is a problem when you have an age limit that there is a temptation for manipulation how to prove that is very difficult
4403918 i dont agree with the judges but i have to respect their decision and learn from this
4403919 hes got a totally different style and he just had me covered from the word go actually
4403920 america gave me many opportunities we love russia very much but were proud to represent the usa
4403921 this is a very unwelcome and unacceptable activity in china
4403922 most people from abroad do not understand the whole tibet issue tibet is an inalienable part of china and the whole world recognizes it
4403923 a small number of people are trying to split the territory and that is not going to work at all
4403924 most of the people in these demonstrations are non chinese so i think they do not know much about the situation
4403925 i know there have been a lot of questions asked was he forced out the door etc etc
4403926 but the clear fact is we sent out on the website an honest statement by the chief executive martin bain explaining the situation
4403927 but then people want to read into it and put their own twist on it theres not a lot we can do
4403928 this is a question that is being tackled by several federations not just gymnastics
4403929 this is a problem when you have an age limit that there is a temptation for manipulation how to prove that is very difficult
4403930 of course brazil is a favorite for the gold medal but i think we are too
4403931 argentina has all the pressure on them because they are the defending champions and a big favorite for the tournament
4403932 to see what is possible on a bmx bike will have people in awe for the tv viewership it cant get any better
4403933 it is just like a roller coaster riding on that track you are going at 40 miles an hour off the start in less than two seconds its a hang on kind of event
4403934 we are good role models we are not just some punk kids riding around town vandalising things and stuff we realise our obligations to kids
4403935 they are trying to appeal to a younger element and add more of the extreme element
4403936 its really cool how this has opened a whole new world to us and everyone else
4403937 i dont agree with the judges but i have to respect their decision and learn from this
4403938 hes got a totally different style and he just had me covered from the word go actually
4403939 of course brazil is a favorite for the gold medal but i think we are too
4403940 argentina has all the pressure on them because they are the defending champions and a big favorite for the tournament
4403941 dem internet kommt bei der partnersuche eine stark zunehmende bedeutung zu
4403942 eine partnersuche ohne einsatz des internets wird bald so aussichtslos sein wie das zuf llige suchen einer bestimmten adresse ohne den entsprechenden stadtplan
4403943 noch vor wenigen jahren war die partnersuche im internet gesellschaftlich noch nicht sehr angesehen
4403944 die suche nach einer neuen liebe im netz wird heute als ganz normale legitime methode angesehen jeder sechste internetnutzer findet inzwischen einen partner im web
4403945 die tendenz ist klar steigend vor einem jahr hatten wir noch 750 000 mitglieder
4403946 vor allem f r ltere menschen die nicht mehr so oft ausgehen wie j ngere wird die online partnersuche zunehmend als alternative eingesetzt
4403947 we were down and i knew i had to start being more aggressive
4403948 i dont know what it was but we werent playing well in the first half
4403949 weve been struggling but have been finding ways to win
4403950 i dont think its really set in but i feel like this journey has been so long
4403951 standing on the podium and hearing olympic champion next to my name was a dream come true
4403952 customers are telling us this is the time of the month theyre really starting to feel the pinch and thats why were investing in price cuts where they really count on everyday essentials like milk bread and butter meat and vegetables
4403953 rising costs continue to hit customers hard and they are looking to tesco to help
4403954 despite clear inflation in some food products we have worked hard to cut our prices week after week and negotiated some fantastic deals with our suppliers to bring shopping bills down
4403955 russ i went roller blading today and havent done so in three years
4403956 if i had to go through this i could at least be an example of trying to live out whats right trying to stand strong and trying to just keep my faith intact
4403957 we gave the truth to the jury we are happy we had an opportunity to try our case
4403958 this lawsuit in my opinion should not have been filed because nothing happened
4403959 its a great vindication and shows us the faithfulness of god
4403960 i just wanted to step on it in the first 50 a little bit and try and get out to an early lead
4403961 were not real big on pointing fingers or attaching blame or airing this out in public
4403962 all persons interviewed highly recommended him for a position of trust and responsibility

4403965 saya tidak fikir ia isu siapa perdana menteri merupakan satu masalah sebenarnya ia telah dieksploitasi oleh pihak tertentu ia hanya satu pandangan
4403966 saya fikir apa yang mereka mahukan ialah siapa juga yang bakal menjadi perdana menteri mestilah berlandaskan kepada islam dan islam sebagai agama rasmi negara ini tidak diabaikan
4403967 sebagai penuntut uitm kami kesal kerana tindakan menteri besar selangor tersebut seolah olah cuba merampas hak kaum melayu sekiranya perlu diwujudkan persaingan kenapa tidak diadakan antara 20 buah universiti yang terdapat di negara ini
4403968 kami kesal kerana kenyataan orang terpelajar seperti abdul khalid itu bukan sahaja mencerminkan beliau tidak peka dengan maruah bangsanya sendiri malah tindakannya itu seolah olah cuba menjahanamkan maruah bangsa melayu
4403969 kita adalah parti yang diberi kemuliaan oleh allah dengan islam kita akan menjadi hina sekiranya kita mencari kemuliaan dengan yang lain dari islam

4403979 met deze blog willen een twee richtingen communicatie starten over hoe we windows 7 maken
4403980 de intentie die we hebben met de communicatie rondom windows 7 is dat we een bepaalde mate van vertrouwen hebben in waar we over praten
4403981 we followed up as many leads as we had we always considered moore a person of interest but back in 2003 we didnt have enough to make the case
4403982 the article came out in the paper and based on that we started getting new leads
4403983 we felt there was sufficient evidence to back it up
4403984 freely sharing with him confidential proprietary and trade secret information
4403985 a jury made a decision and now we have to deal with that
4403986 itll depend on where she is now how important the case is how much it would cost the taxpayers and whether witnesses are still around
4403987 she was a rather bizarre character and seems to have a strange circumstance now
4403988 there was a strong aroma about her and i told her this needed to be taken care of before i went to court with her
4403989 she must know shes a fugitive in at least one state
4403990 he was a special person and he cared about his state
4403991 if he were here he would tell us to not forget what were about and thats taking care of the people
4403992 those are things were investigating right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4403993 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4403994 he was pretty blunt but always had something good to say even if it was something someone didnt like on the other side
4403995 i went to bill and i said i hate to do this but i need to borrow some money to bury my father
4403996 he said blaine whatever you need youve got it thats the kind of man bill was he had a deep love for all of his employees and i can say we all had a deep love for him
4403997 my punishment is nothing compared to the pain and suffering ive brought you
4403998 im not strong enough to ask for forgiveness i ask the lord to forgive ive done horrible things that brought sorrow and pain to these wonderful people
4403999 rodriguez was one of the more violent ones during the escape
4404000 he would put these shanks in peoples ears while they were being tied up making threats
4404001 so he was right in front of him and firing directly at him
4404002 the memory of officer aubrey hawkins his dedication to duty and family are cherished by the irving police department and others that knew aubrey

4404012 in my mind it will stop the shredding of the fabric of our community we must put opportunities in front of our children so that they can go to work and earn a living
4404013 to object to what you call government welfare is your privilege but its not something i can agree with
4404014 i hope you recognize that all the people who have spoken are giving a consistent message we are united together
4404015 if i was the reader and if i had a newspaper i would like to read about somebody else like that
4404016 sure people who want to be international athletes they want the limelight
4404017 but i think maybe this is a little bit more than we would normally enjoy were kind of quiet people
4404018 one thing i said after the 2004 games with the crossfire that i had was that it was the one thing that got shooting on the map had i won that particular event it wouldnt have been as good a story to the general public its kind of the same thing here with his marriage this is fantastic for my sport its getting more people to understand what its about to understand it exists and thats perfect i couldnt be happier about that
4404019 its as good as i can do im extremely satisfied with my performance
4404020 its more than i ever could have dreamed of three medals for one family at the olympics is phenomenal
4404021 but it happens pretty much every great shooter i can think of has done it at least once somewhere
4404022 my main goal for the olympics and its the same this go around is to know that coming in id done everything i could to be prepared i didnt leave any stone unturned i gave it everything i had i knew i did i dont need some trinket to know what i did that day
4404023 i may not have continued shooting and gone on to marry katy to report corrections and clarifications contact reader editor
4404024 we look forward to working with the world leading vendors and operators in the early phases of lte deployment as a member of lsti
4404025 we strongly believe that participation and collaboration in early trials will result in our continued ability to provide monitoring tools that exactly meet the verification deployment and optimization requirements of operators
4404026 deploying femtocells requires a good understanding of market segmentation of both mobile consumer and household markets meticulous planning and targeted marketing campaigns which mean operators will have to invest substantial amount of money if they want femtocell services to gain popularity
4404027 in addition if femtocells are sold to customers in sporadic fashion via traditional mobile operators channels then this may induce a huge scattering of femtocell deployment over large areas not only will this make it hard to manage faps and related networks but most importantly this would mean the operator will not be able to make any capex or opex savings
4404028 btrc is striving relentlessly to introduce affordable new technology services that benefit the bangladeshi people btrc welcomes all initiatives that work towards unveiling new opportunities and building a modern and affordable ict portfolio for bangladeshi consumers btrc is happy to support ericsson in their demonstration of 3g hspa technology i believe there would be immense benefits for bangladeshi telecom subscribers by gaining high speed mobile internet access through 3g hspa technology in the near future
4404029 this pioneering project will showcase the full potential of broadband services for the first time in the country and how an efficient and affordable 3g hspa broadband service can help serve as a blueprint for the widespread introduction of internet connectivity

4404031 i guess what i mean to say is just because soap is a disaster doesnt somehow make rest the answer simpler is better and rest is generally simpler than soap but there is nothing wrong with a plain old post as an rpc call if its easy to make all your calls conform to the restful verb architecture then thats good i guess but if not then just use a post as an rpc call keep it as simple as possible and be done with it and dont spend another minute worrying about being restful or not
4404032 but before they do that they should really try an informal administrative review with us
4404033 if they have a problem we dont know about we can sometimes solve it administratively
4404034 those who will have read that property values are down 20 percent yes next year we will use sales in 2008
4404035 if this trend continues through 2008 we should see more of a decrease in 2009
4404036 its crazy it hits the boiling point and it evaporates

4404039 so when i get ready for school i already know what ill be learning there was stuff on the math wasl that they had showed us in msl
4404040 it teaches us to take care of the community because if we dont take care of the community then no one else will

4404044 i am satisfied that the history given by jatinder to the ambulance officers and to doctors of the consumption of 16 panadol tablets was not true
4404045 i also accept expert evidence that the amount consumed must have been well in excess of that disclosed
4404046 my wife was very friendly a good lady i still miss her
4404047 she did not suicide at all she was a very happy lady she wasnt upset at all even the day before
4404048 this year youll see an even bigger difference because of the economy
4404049 this year the sales tax holiday is sure to be much needed and much appreciated by families shopping for school clothes and fall wardrobes
4404050 the main benefit is the tax savings on top of the fact that retailers have aggressive promotions
4404051 the holiday is always a good incentive to bring shoppers back downtown and take advantage of great offers that a lot of the stores have
4404052 downtown has everything from national retailers like bass shoes factory outlet chicos izod van heusen and a number of independents like douglas mens store footsies ha bas cruz cortez intima boutique nefertiti and many more
4404053 were expecting big crowds for the holiday weekend especially with gas prices right now
4404054 we would expect that a lot of people in the houston metro area who might have traveled further will take advantage of having great beaches and shopping on galveston island
4404055 its just so hard because were still living with it every day were working with his creative contribution
4404056 as we stand here today there are animators who are animating
4404057 we were so proud of the work that he has done and the contribution that hes made and one of the things is that hes never actually going to ever see what an amazing gift he gave to us
4404058 if were going to relocate that decision needs to be made in the next few days so time is of the essence
4404059 the whole basis of the champions trophy is its the best eight teams the best players so not only would it be very disappointing if we had lesser teams taking the place of our major teams but even if those teams went and were under strength it would also be a disappointment to us
4404060 the icc taskforce needs to report back to the icc they need to take on the advice that theyre picking up not only from feedback theyre getting from australia but also from new zealand and england and south africa and other parts of the world
4404061 to some extent the ball is in their court but at the same time were obviously very interested in taking on advice from all the various sources right now
4404062 i have never texted or emailed senator obama and ill offer a million dollars to anyone who could prove otherwise
4404063 in fact ive only talked to the senator once in the last year and a half on the phone
4404064 i would hope that my friend obamas republican rival john mccain would join me in condemning this kind of politics
4404065 although i support senator obama i would never be dumb enough to offer policy advice to either candidate they seem to be doing fine without me

4404069 the major causes of permanent intellectual disablement and death after head injury may be torsional forces leading to diffuse axonal injury dai a form of injury which usual helmets cannot mitigate and may make worse 61 helmets may increase the torsional forces by increasing the distance from the centre of the spine to the outside of the helmet compared to the distance to the scalp without a helmet
4404070 in real accidents while broken helmets are common it is extremely unusual to see any helmet that has compressed foam and thus may have performed as intended

4404082 ive been in london for nine years but id like to move to solihull because its such a lovely area
4404083 i really enjoyed meeting karren and would say it was the highlight of being on the apprentice i didnt find out what shed said about me until the episode was broadcast
4404084 we caught up after the programme had aired i tested the water and im looking forward to working with her
4404085 one of the reasons i like the area so much is that there are a lot of stables about
4404086 these are fantastic results that really reflect the hard work of our children and teachers
4404087 they have once again put solihull on the map and i would like to offer my congratulations to each and every one
4404088 it is clear that solihull is one of the best education authorities in the country with some of the best schools
4404089 there are a quite a lot of people living locally with aviation knowledge and they had plenty of questions they wanted to ask
4404090 however it seems as if the airport people didnt want to answer them
4404091 we will have a senior team from the airport present at the rescheduled meeting probably including our new chief executive paul kehoe
4404092 it was she who gave me strength and courage to work on this issue

4404101 they say rangers have not had much money until now
4404102 but i find that hard to understand because they get 50 000 people every other week and it is a very big club
4404103 we are being obliged to contemplate transfers of 6m 8m and that type of figure so it seems strange a club of that stature can only afford what they have offered us
4404104 i see jonathan as a top player and a very high class footballer
4404105 he still wants to learn as we all do and i include myself in that weve got a journey to go and weve got to learn as we go along
4404106 the premier league is somewhere where yes we want to be competitive every week and picking up victories along the way
4404107 in my mind jonathan brings versatility to my team and i do see him sometimes this season playing on the wing and not in centre midfield and sometimes behind a striker or in a sitting role where he can dictate the game
4404108 ultimately i hope to have enough players in the squad when the window shuts so we have lots of different options
4404109 jonathan is another player with the quality required to play at the level and the quality to play in different positions in our team
4404110 i think hes been a victim of a board thats come in given him a lot of money and wanted success immediately
4404111 he spent the money and unfortunately what he spent it on didnt bear fruit thats not his fault it was just bad luck with injuries i think hes got to be judged on what happens from now
4404112 somebodys got to be the favourite to get the sack first and unfortunately its him because of the demand at west ham for success but the odds on him going will soon change if we stick two or three quick wins together
4404113 its a slow process and youve got to build a foundation
4404114 there are a lot of players who did themselves the power of good with how we performed in the last five games of last season so hopefully the new players can come in and enhance that
4404115 there will be those who are disappointed but by virtue the ones who do start know they have to perform because weve got a bit of competition if not in every position in quite a few
4404116 ive been really surprised that people think its just a case of turning up and well beat stoke
4404117 thats not the case stoke will prove to everybody over the course of the season that theyre a really difficult opponent for everybody that they play
4404118 they come up with the momentum of being promoted theyve got some good players
4404119 they say rangers have not had much money until now
4404120 but i find that hard to understand because they get 50 000 people every other week and it is a very big club
4404121 we are being obliged to contemplate transfers of 6m 8m and that type of figure so it seems strange a club of that stature can only afford what they have offered us
4404122 we have performed very well in recent friendlies they have been great attacking performances so it is not something that concerns me
4404123 we are aware there are only two weeks to go before the end of the window that is something we are working on constantly anyway
4404124 we work without rest to look for players and weve always known the deadline day is the august 31
4404125 we are working calming in the background on one or two things we prefer to work with as much discretion as we can

4404207 we just missed out on europe last season and thats what we will be looking to do this year
4404208 we obviously dont want to say too much but well be looking to push on and get back into europe
4404209 but the important thing to remember is that we are relatively still a small club in terms of fan base and our limited resources
4404210 i always feel that over the last four or five seasons under mark hughes that weve punched above our weight
4404211 weve overachieved as a club whether its in the transfer market or with our league position
4404212 what we must do now and im sure we will is keep progressing and move forward
4404213 everyones settled in really well the manager and new staff have come in
4404214 i hate to dwell on the past but mark hughes and his team did a tremendous job for the club
4404215 but we have moved on now the new manager has come in and straight from the word go hes been really good and really positive
4404216 he doesnt want to stand still he wants to move on and progress the club

4404227 umpires tend to be intimated by john which generally means they are more lenient with him he crossed the line today we are dealing with a group of extremely competitive guys and john is one of them he agreed to the first three code violations but disagreed with the fourth for an obscene gesture john said that he did not do it and the umpire said he 100 percent categorically saw it we have to go with the umpires ruling
4404228 i guess 1992 in new haven was the last time i played john has anything changed i guess he has one of those explosive personalities you could say there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires i said something to the official as players we are in control of the match officials are in charge of the integrity of the game
4404229 i dont really have anyone to blame but myself this is like a long story that culminates in me getting defaulted in a big tournament i mean i guess it was bound to happen its too bad i dont feel good about it but i cant say that im totally surprised
4404230 for the vast majority of players this is a non issue historically there have been more issues with johns matches than the other guys but this was over the top we tell them the umpires to set guidelines early in the match so that the players know their boundaries if you dont things can get ugly quickly
4404231 i am going to recede from you ever so slowly till you start coming towards me
4404232 at this point it is hard to see why anyone would stick their neck out for gen musharraf
4404233 i am celebrating our independence which i feel is near
4404234 we believe that missile defense is a substantial contribution to natos collective security
4404235 i look at it nobody got hurt and i can replace all the other stuff
4404236 last night we had a major fire in conshohocken probably in the history of the borough its one of the worst weve had
4404237 they say if you have no fear its not for you anymore
4404238 if a firefighter would go down and be trapped we would respond immediately
4404239 as long as everyone comes home something must have gone right
4404240 thanks to safer vehicles aggressive law enforcement and our efforts countless families were spared the devastating news that a loved one was not coming home
4404241 i dont know the man but i grew up watching him on tv
4404242 as ambassador to nato i will receive thousands of visitors per year at my residence
4404243 in addition to being an honor and great advertisement for hatboro itself the quilt would speak to all our visitors about our country our history our pride our diversity and the fact that america is a nation built on the hope and hard work of good people in towns small and large
4404244 i have nothing against kurt i watched him grow up and hes a very talented man
4404245 it just shows a nice side of america and starts a different conversation about what america is like
4404246 its not what people traditionally think of its not an andrew wyeth painting but its a piece of folk art and it shows things about real people
4404247 weve made it very clear in a situation in which russia is involved militarily in the sovereign territory of a neighbor there cant be business as usual with russia
4404248 right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4404249 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4404250 the agreement is designed to provide rapid recovery of fair compensation for american nationals with terrorism related claims against libya
4404251 it will also address libyan claims arising from previous u s military actions the agreement is being pursued on a purely humanitarian basis and does not constitute an admission of fault by either party
4404252 both parties welcomed the establishment of a process to provide fair compensation for their respective nationals and thereby turn their focus to the future of their bilateral relationship
4404253 the big thing is be prepared to evacuate its something that needs to be in place before any disaster happens
4404254 i ran up the fire escape and grabbed my dog and my phone
4404255 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4404256 and also i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
4404257 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4404258 im not sure what he was trying to do i think it was a trial balloon
4404259 we hope sen mccain picks someone of his own ideological stripe a pro life running mate
4404260 from a political point of view having a little bit of a rebellion on the right at the republican convention and showing that streak of independence for moderates it wouldnt be so bad
4404261 tom ridge would make a fine vice president and it certainly would help mccain in pennsylvania
4404262 the most difficult thing was to answer their question where was god
4404263 most mothers here are tortured because they dont know what happened
4404264 the lawyers for the mayor said they were willing to comply
4404265 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4404266 feel that their voices were heard and their views respected
4404267 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states
4404268 the one thing you really have to do as a nominee is establish your dominance over the party
4404269 people want to see the presidential nominee controlling the convention
4404270 in the interest of being gracious and avoiding the alienation of the clinton people they basically folded
4404271 reluctantly conceded it was safer than having these people walk away from denver disgruntled
4404272 how do you handle this so you dont offend people who dont like the clintons
4404273 on the other hand you dont want to offend the clinton supporters
4404274 delegate to the victims their counsel or the courts the responsibility of the executive branch to make americas foreign policy response to acts of terrorism
4404275 i have great respect for this panel but i could not disagree more with their analysis or reasoning
4404276 it just seems to be totally wrong to us to have a decision be made on who gets immunity and who does or does not get immunity based not on law but because of political decisions made by the diplomatic corps
4404277 we believe that the court was wrong in its interpretation of the law
4404278 under the courts rationale were a new yorker to be sideswiped by a car driven by an employee of the saudi embassy they could sue for bumps and bruises yet nearly 3 000 families of those innocents who were brutally killed in lower manhattan cannot pursue their claims
4404279 i expected it because its the truth and i know the truth always stands firm
4404280 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4404281 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
4404282 it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves
4404283 if we screw up the energy flow within our systems we could end up with no crabs no shrimp no fish that is where these dead zones are heading unless we stop their growth
4404284 the farmers would certainly prefer to have their fertilizer on the land rather than floating down the river
4404285 minutes after i passed the resting spot i heard a big explosion i turned my head and saw big flames
4404286 we rushed to the scene and saw charred bodies while wounded people were crying for help pots and burned prayer rugs were scattered all over the place
4404287 seconds later i saw fire and flaying pieces of flesh
4404288 i fell down and i was able to see one of my legs bleeding people were running in all directions

4404313 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4404314 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4404315 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4404316 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4404317 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4404318 eigentlich wollten wir nur urlaub in australien machen doch es wurde eine reise um die halbe welt fast 50 000km in ber 13 monaten

4404321 he has done many many terrible things he blew up the french plane and he blew up the american plane and what does the bush administration do the bush administration is far more on the side of the libyans than it is as far as the victims of terrorism go though it talks a good line about caring about terrorism if they can make friends with moammar gadhafi because they want his oil then that tells you where they stand
4404322 its really sickening and its really dirty they are being very private and secretive about it
4404323 the settlement goes to both sides the settlement is for outstanding claims on the part of libya as well as the united states
4404324 i dont have any information on that but the fund has been established i have no information on what the financial agreement will be or the financial compensation that will be paid
4404325 condoleezza rice is going to libya to kiss gadhafis feet
4404326 so this is what has come he blew up an american plane and i am supposed to have faith in the government of this country
4404327 we went through a long path of negotiations until we reached this agreement
4404328 it opens new horizons for relations based on mutual respect the agreement turns the page on the negative past forever
4404329 this is done after the murder of my innocent daughter and 270 people killed
4404330 gadhafi was the one who was behind the attack on that disco and reagan responded
4404331 how do you negotiate with people who threaten to blow you up if you dont give them what they want

4404343 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

4404345 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4404346 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4404347 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4404348 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4404349 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4404350 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4404351 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4404352 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4404353 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4404354 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 y la declaraci n de las naciones unidas esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
4404355 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 ratificado por ley no 1257 y actualmente la declaraci n de las naciones unidas ratificada por ley no 3760 esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
4404356 las personas privadas extranjeras que operan en el pa s como es la empresa manquiri subsidiaria de la minera americana coeur dalene como en el presente caso y que tienen adem s instancias encargadas de velar que el desempe o de sus inversiones es la tarea de opic no derive en da os a las comunidades ind genas y originaria son bien acogidas sus iniciativas de soluci n de conflictos que permitan alcanzar una real y efectiva restituci n de los derechos vulnerados o en riesgo de ser vulnerados
4404357 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales
4404358 en el marco de sus atribuciones y competencias conferidas por la constituci n pol tica del estado y la ley no 1818 en lo que toca a preservar el respeto a los derechos humanos de los pueblos ind genas reflejados en el ordenamiento jur dico nacional y los instrumentos internacionales reconocidos por bolivia
4404359 la empresa va a tratar de resolver este conflicto muy r pidamente para no da ar m s su reputaci n los miembros del ayllu no deber an someterse a una negociaci n que no tiene condiciones justas y deber an exigir que opic tome la responsabilidad por los incumplimientos de sus pol ticas por parte de la empresa minera en cuesti n
4404360 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile

4404362 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
4404363 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
4404364 to the mall the playground playdates to target just to go somewhere
4404365 if youre a stay at home mother youd better have a darned good reason to go somewhere you wonder where can i stop by on my way home from another errand
4404366 we just dont have as much money as we used to
4404367 i was famous for running here and there to get ingredients
4404368 if i was missing something id run out and get it i dont do that anymore i sit down and plan meals two weeks ahead then buy everything at once
4404369 ive always wanted to be a stay at home mom
4404370 if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
4404371 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
4404372 we are not staying home with our children by default
4404373 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
4404374 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheck wont come its that much more frightening
4404375 there are times when i think if i were back at work i could afford this or that
4404376 but i dont think it would pan out in the end
4404377 we had a date night for a while once a week but it petered out
4404378 maybe it was my birthday in may last year not this year
4404379 to find a job that pays something decent i would still have to drive an hour each way at 4 30 a gallon
4404380 i go to five places in one day with three kids its horrible
4404381 how can we justify eating out when we could go to a store and buy enough for a couple days worth of meals
4404382 theres just no time to regroup none left for ourselves
4404383 in our business world when a lot of people talk about monitoring theyre actually doing a reactive call center
4404384 but things are moving in real time the idea of sending data to a marketing and ad network is a lot more stringent its a need to be there type of situation we decided that the only way we could become what would be considered a fully monitored network was to find world class networking software
4404385 nimsoft has turned into a pretty broad it management product especially with its acquisition of indicative
4404386 do a pretty good job of embracing the whole management of virtualized systems
4404387 if you put the two together you have a good combination of managing and monitoring virtualized environments
4404388 in a lot of our networks theyre giving affidavits to their companies and theyre expecting us to hand them those reports so they can turn it into an advertising affidavit
4404389 we dont feel like weve been put into some box
4404390 we feel like theyre highly interested in us and believe they will be there to work with us i think thats important for companies that are small to medium sized and growing
4404391 to get bigger we need a software provider thats willing to roll up their shirtsleeves and work with us
4404392 but nimsoft can be a little more nimble in embracing new technologies with ibm hp and bmc it can take a little bit longer to get it out of the labs theres more bureaucracy to deal with
4404393 youre not sure what the end game is going to be
4404394 is it going to go public in a couple years will someone buy them and then youre looking at a migration

4404407 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas

4404409 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4404410 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4404411 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4404412 russia is an oil producing country and russians are using their new oil wealth to finance a big growth in new vehicles
4404413 you have to deal with those issues and hope that they will be worked out but at the end of the day our customers are expecting us to follow them there
4404414 if we want to have the contracts we have to have production
4404415 its our first step to establish something and of course its much easier if youre in the market already and then you can gain business then if you are still outside
4404416 how do you negotiate with people who threaten to blow you up if you dont give them what they want
4404417 the picture is completely absolutely 100 per cent on schedule on time there were no delays
4404418 ive seen the movie it is fabulous we would have been perfectly able to have it out in november
4404419 we will issue orders soon for the implementation of the 6th pay commission recommendations
4404420 using x rays to find solutions to earth science questions is an area that has been highly active on the srs at daresbury laboratory for some time we are very excited that the srs has contributed to answering such long standing questions about the earth in this way
4404421 the results suggest that efforts should be made to develop drugs that could be given in a controlled clinical or treatment environment in which addicts would have their most potent drug memories reactivated such treatments would be expected to diminish the effects of those memories in the future and help individuals resist relapse and maintain their abstinence
4404422 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defense system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4404423 he was the most kind soft spoken man very polite
4404424 he made his bed put his clothes on a hanger he was a career military man spit and polish to the end
4404425 it does concern me that not only in missouri but apparently other states this is the person they turn to
4404426 it does illustrate how difficult it is to find doctors willing to do this
4404427 i assure them ive taken care of everything so that nothing will go wrong i help them calmly go through the procedure
4404428 it will have the same effect the guy will die
4404429 i was a little sluggish but now it feels good and my body woke up in the heat
4404430 there is a very good chance that we will have six caribbean sprinters in the final
4404431 i was a little flat but it got over the line so that is all that matters
4404432 i feel very good i expended very little energy so i think i have a lot to give in the final
4404433 no matter what the event is i want to win but it didnt happen
4404434 i didnt know i had as little time as i did i didnt even have time to go into the ready room
4404435 i went from the ceremony straight into putting my parka on and goggles cap and go it was about two minutes i knew it was tight but not that tight
4404436 it just kind of flowed it just happened it felt great i just kept it strong and powered to the end
4404437 the last 15 i had plenty left in me i saw liesel behind and just pushed for the wall
4404438 i didnt know what was going on i just went for it
4404439 full credit for her she kept working hard and driving through the wall
4404440 i was so thankful that i was in there in the first place and i got a lane
4404441 i just forgot about the pain and got ready for my next race
4404442 thats the theme of the meet you have to break a world record to win
4404443 i visited the shrine as i hope that those who gave their lives in past wars will rest in peace
4404444 it would be strange if the ideas of the prime minister and myself were always the same
4404445 i will not visit yasukuni while i serve as foreign minister
4404446 i have heard that some ministers are visiting yasukuni in a private capacity and it depends on the insight of each minister
4404447 for us its sad i hope he does what he has to do mr koizumi was upstanding
4404448 the way to pay tribute to the war dead is for us to face the past humbly and to hand down the historical facts to the future without allowing the lessons from the miserable war fade away
4404449 establishing a nonreligious memorial at which all people could commemorate the war dead together
4404450 i pledge in front of the souls of the war dead to realize a world free of war and nuclear weapons based on the principles of the war renouncing japanese constitution which is managed through international concord not through retaliation and threat and which respects liberty and human rights
4404451 we need to find out what the japanese people think about it i do not think the time to take action on the issue has come
4404452 the home of literature we have spent so much time learning and loving
4404453 if were going to continue to see weaponization that is used in conflicts like afghanistan and iraq put on the canada u s border saying that its required for safety and security it really changes the nature of our relationship
4404454 forgotten history of the western people from the earliest origins
4404455 defendants notice of motion in limine based on plea of once in jeopardy for order precluding the prosecution from discussing in its opening statement introducing evidence of making closing arguments on or seeking instructions on any lesser included offense of the charged crimes of second degree murder
4404456 dominick has so much to offer the world it would be so sad if hes not with us much longer
4404457 purports to be a declaration but its not a declaration it doesnt establish any evidence or facts but it does state argument
4404458 1101 b doesnt require that level of recipe that all 1101 b s are on a date the defense said this is not consistent because its not similar enough they are relying on a civil case bowen and not a criminal law case
4404459 in this case here in every one of our incidents the exact same weapon was used that distinguishes our case from bowen a single common marker and in our case
4404460 what the court said is motive the curt identified that as the basis no way that this evidence flies as motive they are trying to do exactly what you told them not to do
4404461 this is a new trial im not bound by any of that im not bound by anything in the first trial
4404462 we didnt respond because our thought is we didnt think it was necessary we thought it was ridiculous we felt we didnt need to respond
4404463 they presented the doctrine of chances the doctrine of corroboration under that theory our motion was to exclude this evidence on motive our motive is that there simply is a misconstruction of motive of 1101 b with kemper that was presented as a common scheme or plan not motive
4404464 there are so many things wrong here in order to add kemper they are suddenly changing their scheme
4404465 mr weinberg says hes not prepared not prepared to argue kemper and then he argues kemper we could have saved several pages of dianes transcription the court reporter and the courts time
4404466 the woman your client tried to get permanently removed from the courtroom in the first trial

4404471 hi my name is lisabeth i am so glad my cousin introduced me to this site
4404472 theres less employment theres less wealth and now banks are restraining credit
4404473 we just dont see where the consumer is going to get the money
4404474 the numbers are the worst weve seen and its not just the magnitude of the problem but the scope so many markets are affected
4404475 the economy is showing signs of distress and a lot of folks are in distress
4404476 we are not out of the woods yet the inflation picture is still worrying
4404477 the monetary policy committee has considered recent economic developments and the outlook for inflation and has concluded that notwithstanding certain risks to future inflation outcomes the current monetary policy stance is appropriate
4404478 if there was a tipping point in the decision to maintain the status quo on interest rates it must have been the re weighting exercise
4404479 under such uncertainty it was probably inappropriate for the mpc to hike rates any further
4404480 for blaming all our problems exclusively on imperialism without internal self reflection and criticism
4404481 we have always said the anc must retain its tradition of bias towards the poor however the sacp and the labour movement need to remain independent from their partner the anc
4404482 the tendency in many african countries after liberation was to collapse left formations into the liberation movements ushering in

4404484 there have been 33 pre trial applications in this matter not all brought by zuma but the reality is that we just saw an application by zuma to have the charges against him declared invalid we are now seeing a stay of prosecution application and there is also the mauritius matter the npa say they are court ready
4404485 so i dont have a chance in hell with you do i
4404486 thats not what i said you just need to get your together and start trusting me im not your ex fiance
4404487 siento que s lo quieren plata y no tocar otros asuntos sin interpretar lo que piensa el pueblo boliviano
4404488 during last nights broadcast a woman named libra was arguing with a man and said memphis was in the f ing room
4404489 there is absolutely no justification for allowing an f word like this to air unedited on prime time broadcast television there can be no question that this was an intentional act on the part of the network someone actually had to edit the scene with the word into the show just this past november cbs hypocritically entered into yet another consent decree with the federal communications commission fcc promising not to air indecent material but apparently cbs will break its own formal promise again last time it was to air a teen orgy this time it is for the opportunity to air the f word cbs behavior is a direct result of the 2 nd circuit court of appeals ruling on so called fleeting profanity a case that will be heard by the supreme court this fall but let me be clear unlike the facts of that legal challenge this was no live broadcast it was an intentional airing of pre packaged program that contained obscene language the networks reprehensible decision to air it cannot go without consequence
4404490 this case does not involve a two way radio conversation between a cab driver and a dispatcher or a telecast of an elizabethan comedy we have not decided that an occasional expletive in either setting would justify any sanction or indeed that this broadcast would justify a criminal prosecution
4404491 we have been dismayed by a series of recent fcc decisions that have transformed a hitherto moderate policy of policing only the most extreme cases of indecent broadcast programming into a campaign of regulatory surveillance that will chill the production of all but the blandest of broadcast programming
4404492 to effectuate its new clean up the airwaves policy the commission has radically expanded the definition of indecency beyond its original conception magnified the penalties for even minor ephemeral images or objectionable language and targeted respected television programs movies and even noncommercial documentaries
4404493 they said the courts work would be incomplete if it simply struck down the fleeting expletives policy arguing that the fccs indecency calls in cases of nudity and nonfleeting profanity were inconsistent and that the commission was using context as a talisman to ward off serious questions about the extreme subjectivity of the agencys determinations
4404494 it is time for the court to bring its views of the electronic media into alignment with contemporary technological and social reality as former regulators we appreciate that the fcc is in an uncomfortable position buffeted by the turbulent passions of anxious parents and threats from excited congressmen but that is precisely why the matter must be taken out of the agencys hands entirely
4404495 the episodes opening recap featured a shouting match between jerry and memphis
4404496 given the frequency and severity of the swearing the show should have been rated tv 14 l
4404497 bruce attempts to scold laurie for being involved with her older teacher but when laurie shoots back with what about what you two were doing
4404498 by airing content intended for premium cable channels on network television cbs has subjected families to topics that only adult couples should be discussing and like so much of tv today by suggesting that monogamy is stifling and therefore unhealthy the show fails to promote positive exploration of sexuality within the confines of marriage
4404499 by airing content intended for premium cable channels on network television cbs has subjected families to topics that only adult couples should be discussing
4404500 i think the girls are going to do very well against big pussy
4404501 it is pathetic that a medium with the tremendous power which television possesses is willing to objectify one half of the human race but increasingly remarks about breasts scenes emphasizing breasts and even entire storylines about breasts are becoming commonplace on tv such a focus ignores intelligence personality charm integrity and the entire host of human qualities and essentially reduces women to objects valued only for their anatomy
4404502 a day and time widely regarded within the entertainment industry as the place where series go to die
4404503 the messages swingtown is sending to young viewers marriage vows are meaningless teachers kissing students is acceptable and any kind of sex with any number of people has no consequences whatsoever
4404504 touted as a redemptive series chronicling a troubled female detectives struggle against her personal demons the shows underlying positive themes are often undercut by over the top depictions of sex and drug use
4404505 dont show it and dont even go into details in saying it

4404521 i am satisfied that the history given by jatinder to the ambulance officers and to doctors of the consumption of 16 panadol tablets was not true
4404522 i also accept expert evidence that the amount consumed must have been well in excess of that disclosed
4404523 my wife was very friendly a good lady i still miss her
4404524 the main push has been a firmer us dollar across the board as well as weaker commodities
4404525 the us is not out of the woods but seems to be improving compared to the rest of the world
4404526 thats why the sentiment towards the us dollar has changed
4404527 history does not repeat itself and the rise and decline of britains empire was and remains quite different from the american situation

4404536 the committee has poked its nose out of the pocket of the coal sector long enough to tell the australian community that we will be the ones to carry the can for the mega profitable coal giants
4404537 the government needs to explain why the polluter shouldnt pay for cleaning up its own act and carry the risk of burying carbon pollution
4404538 this is a very important industry for the future of australia for the public interest and for the national interest

4404726 from my understanding and personal experience visa s are rarely denied when an immediate family member is away and dies especially with the media coverage this case is getting if the visa was denied maybe it was because they decided to bury her in guyana but why was the husband so quick to leave the country
4404727 if the visa was denied maybe it was because they decided to bury her in guyana

4404745 hey i got this weird ass text message what the hell does that mean
4404746 youve just been fd or something of that nature if im not mistaken that is also what he told the guyana chronicles looks like he cant get his story straight
4404747 on 21 mar 2007 at 1 06 pm1 d i think this was a very tragic and very sad story why did this young beautful guyanese woman in our community had to die in the hand of a ruthless killer i read the newspapers and even saw it on the news and couldn t believe that this happened natasha had a order of protection so why she wasn t protected from this monster we need to stand toether as a community and protect our people remember our people left guyana to come to u s for a better life and it s just so sad to see that we are killing each other i think guilt got the best of this murderer so she wouldn t testify and now look what happened i hope he gets life in prison
4404748 i tied her up because i thought she was into that
4404749 for he who have not sinned cast the first stone
4404750 i would like to add that her two years of hell consists of two men who allegedly both had restraining orders this brings us to another thing two men two restraining orders but only one is being held responsible
4404751 her two years of hell consists fo two men who both had restraining orders but who both allegedly did something to deserve it
4404752 so i think everyone should consider this regardless of whether the rape happened or not if people still think he did it anger revenge hate etc then how come there is no evidence against him
4404753 in america colleges have classes up until 10 p m so the late night reference is just stupid
4404754 they are holding him for first degree and second degree murder yet they really have no solid proof that he did it other than their theories and his motive because if they did they would never offer him a plea bargain
4404755 if the police have charged someone with 1st degree murder 2nd degree murder and criminal posession of a weapon then they surely have some evidence of this
4404756 and the only answer a jury will come up with after a trial is guilty
4404757 the burden of proof in all criminal litigation is entirely on the governmental prosecutor to prove each necessary element of the statutory violation against the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant never carries the burden of proving innocence although he or she may be required to prove the elements of certain affirmative defenses such as self defense the defendant is presumed to be innocent at all stages of a criminal proceeding and is legally not guilty until conviction on a finding of guilt after trial admission of guilt pursuant to a guilty plea or a failure to contest guilt through entering a plea of no contest or nolo contendere the strength of the government s prosecution therefore rests not on whether the defendant actually committed the crime charged but rather on the government s evidence to prove that the defendant did
4404758 trials therefore carry significant risk for the government a trial always carries with it the risk of an acquittal which in turn may result in a loss of credibility which may lead to political consequences particularly when the prosecutor is an elected official or works for an elected official often a prosecutor is faced with issues affecting the substance or admissibility of evidence such as when evidence is obtained by illegal or constitutionally impermissible means for instance through a coerced or otherwise infirm confession or an improper search or seizure
4404759 hermant must be innocent of something to be turning down plea bargains left and right
4404760 not all scholars really have a plain ole thing called common sense
4404761 isnt she a human being regardless if she is a whore or whatever you people are categorizing her as now

4404768 the board unanimously concluded that this revised proposal also materially undervalued the company and its prospects and that the proposed transaction structure was unattractive for shareholders
4404769 adecco places considerable value on the management and strong culture of michael page it is therefore important to adecco that it is able to retain the senior management of michael page in the event that an offer is completed

4404782 even among white workers a group of voters that has been targeted by both parties as a key to victory in november obama leads mccain by 10 percentage points 47 to 37 and has the advantage as the more empathetic candidate
4404783 back in the day john mccain was the sort of politician who would stand first in line to call out this sort of swill
4404784 no way to balance it or explain it other than as evidence of a severe character defect on the part of the candidate who allows the book to be used
4404785 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4404786 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well

4404789 we arriveerden er met een groep van pakweg 30 man de meesten zijn cli nt maar er waren ook begeleiders en ouders en behalve onze groep zag ik meer bezoekers met een handicap die juist nu naar de kermis waren gekomen verbijstering alom
4404790 die mannen zijn kapot ze konden vanwege de storm pas om 4 00 uur in ouddorp de tenten afbreken en richting etten leur rijden en vandaag moet alles weer op tijd klaar zijn the show must go on
4404791 de komende vier dagen zit ik in de buurt van bergen op zoom toch kom ik niet vaak meer in mijn eigen stad
4404792 echt iets voor jou werken bij het circus jij doet altijd gek loopt op je handen enzo probeer dat maar eens kreeg ik van hem te horen
4404793 binnen een week was het geregeld en kon ik beginnen mijn belangrijkste taken bestaan uit het verzorgen van evenementen zo kunnen bedrijven allerlei soorten feesten bij ons boeken verschillende acts van de reguliere show kunnen worden gereserveerd voor die evenementen daarnaast hebben we arrangementen voor familiedagen tijdens zon dag houden we workshops waarbij de gasten zich even acrobaat jongleur of clown voelen ik vind het leuk om zon evenement voor onze klanten op een creatieve manier in te vullen dat zit nou eenmaal in mn bloed ik ga bijna elke avond naar de voorstelling kijken en geef regelmatig adviezen over de artistieke inhoud sorry maar dat kan ik echt niet laten
4404794 ik ben al achttien jaar bezig met theater het werken bij een circus is voor mij een ideale uitlaatklep ik kan mijn creativiteit kwijt en daarnaast vind ik het leuk om dingen te regelen
4404795 ik ben dan wel niet opgegroeid in deze wereld maar als kleine jongen was ik gefascineerd door de kermis en het circus als de tent weer op plein 13 stond ging ik er op mijn fietsje naartoe om mee te helpen drie keer raden wat ik van mijn legoblokken bouwde juist een circustent
4404796 ik had nog nooit gekampeerd wist ik veel hoe ik alles moest aansluiten gelukkig kreeg ik in het begin de nodige hulp en went het sneller dan je denkt om altijd onderweg te zijn
4404797 je komt op plaatsen waar je normaal gesproken niet aan denkt om op eigen initiatief naar toe te gaan zo stonden we laatst in volendam ik was er nog nooit geweest moest ik natuurlijk wel even op de foto in klederdracht toerist willy haha
4404798 ik denk dat we een lint van zeker een kilometer vormen
4404799 precies in de vastenavendtijd dat komt perfect uit en in juni zijn alle medewerkers vrij en gaan we op vakantie ons circus herbergt vijftien nationaliteiten in die tijd waaien we alle kanten uit
4404800 ik heb weer genoten van de gezelligheid van dit familie evenement veel mensen hebben dit weer mogelijk gemaakt dan denk ik niet alleen aan de bezoekers en ondernemers bij zon 6 daags evenement als de kermis zijn er helaas ook altijd inwoners die de keerzijde ervaren door de extra overlast dat is helaas onvermijdelijk maar ook dankzij hun begrip kunnen dit soort evenementen plaatsvinden dat mag ook wel eens gezegd worden
4404801 they just needed one signal that if i vote for him more babies can be saved than if we keep wrangling over whether roe v wade is going to be overturned

4404839 terrorism extremism communalism and fundamentalism have emerged as major challenges to the unity and integrity of our country the recent terrorist attacks in bangalore ahmedabad jaipur and other parts of the country have shocked the nation
4404840 what words can i find to condemn such acts of barbarism i share the sorrow and grief of people affected by terrorism the government of india will take concrete steps to rehabilitate and help such families
4404841 they built it by walking across our collective backs when i was at the source women ran shit literally and figuratively we led the editorial meetings we held down the fort we provided the research development fact checking writing planning and scheduling it took to print the most popular rap magazine on the planet but we also provided the ass
4404842 40 year old sasquatch of a so called hip hop feminist named mirandajane
4404843 mixtapes are like cigarettes and marijuana cigarettes are the albums people put in stores and mixtapes are the marijuana that you cant get in stores
4404844 state law requires that the true name and address of the person responsible for producing the cd appears on the label and the product in all of the cases where you see local police involved they simply did not comply with state law with some of these products you almost have to listen to the entire cd to tell if it is remixed to the point of being original you cant tell that by looking at the label but the police look at the label and see no one is identified or in some cases a false name and address is given they might have the name and address of a legitimate label and we can take a look
4404845 thats the thing that we are totally dumbfounded by we were a soundscan store the record labels loved us wed get in stores with artists like 8 ball and mjg or david banner wed get a box of def jam cds to give away or scan through to get a higher place on billboard we bought so much and wed been around for so long we felt that what we were doing was what the hip hop game wanted we wouldnt fuck with counterfeits bootlegs none of that stuff if i got wind of another store selling a counterfeit or a bootleg id go talk to them about it so we had no indication that what we were doing was wrong we had police officers who would come in and buy mixtapes all the time and i had one local police officer who offered to go to court for us if we went to trial
4404846 we also get complaints filed by competing retailers and we get complaints from consumers sometimes who buy a product and decide that its a ripped cd and they feel cheated quite frankly sometimes we will get complaints from record companies or from artists on piracy that theyd observed in none of those cases does it make it automatically a priority we have to assess those complaints and the context of all of the problems weve got going on and make decisions from there sometimes we engage in a lot of training for police departments as to what piracy is about and what state laws are about sometimes well get a call from the police department and theyll ask for our technical advice the implication of your question and what youve heard is perhaps theres some undue influence of some labels targeting specific retailers but thats not a major driving force on what we do on a regular basis
4404847 we opened up almost a year ago and were selling mix cds out in the open im in defiance like lets go to federal court
4404848 one of the biggest things that really killed us was in the local paper the headline was
4404849 well let me stand back and say i dont want to get into the facts of any particular case because it may be law enforcement information that i may not have access or may not be at liberty to share basically we have programs where we constantly survey the retail music market looking for people who are selling product that violates state or federal law in terms of copyright this is something that goes on around the country all the time and we do it by generally surveying thousands of stores
4404850 i dont think you should assume we dont ever go after the source sometimes youve got to start at the retail level everyone involved has to understand that certain activity is illegal in cases like youve seen in ny and the berry case these are generally cases that dont have anything to do with federal copyright law whether or not someone was authorized to use copyrighted material it has to do with whether or not product was labeled in accordance with state law
4404851 they just shut down one of my stores about two weeks ago we have six retail spots and one is in the flea market where i sell my dj jelly mix cds they arrested one of my partners i mean its really a bigger problem for everybody involved in hip hop that we dont have control over what we do
4404852 i know some raids happened down here i dont know which stores
4404853 i started in 1993 i was pushing ny mixtapes to a lot of local stores in florida
4404854 what happened to me drove a big shock through miami there were just a lot of people scared i do still listen to mixtapes but only underground stuff i never listened to the stuff i sold mixtape com is now a clothing store i sell a lot of independent clothing lines i like to support them the same way i liked to support mixtapes at least i know with fashion theres no way for me to get in trouble i only knew the music industry i used to do street team work and i just lost the taste for it after this happened to me so i started my own clothing line called graff gear

4404859 i expected me and doom to make good music and become legends
4404860 hip hop tends to be about whos the flyest who has the biggest chain
4404861 so its kind of like the mask is the opposite of that its like it dont matter what he looks like what race he is all that matters is the vocals the spit the beats the rhymes
4404862 doom was concerned with making money right now and feeding his family by any means necessary
4404863 its about getting money and thats that i got children to feed
4404864 ive been moved and moved most of them wasnt wheelchair accessible
4404865 i remember visiting him up in fishkill new york and the facilities were a little better
4404866 but he told me about how before hed basically had to crawl to the shower in another case medical staff didnt want to have to change his catheter so they gave him a drug that kept him from having to urinate he got very ill because of it because he was not eliminating the way he should have been
4404867 i got my hands on billboard forbes fortune anything that dealt with marketing
4404868 and i learned the business models of people like quincy jones russell simmons tommy mottola and jimmy iovine i basically took my years in prison and i used it as college

4404871 were not a gang were not a boy scout troop were a bunch of vandals who hang out
4404872 the streets are the galleries you can see the art for free but you might pay for being in the wrong place

4404875 i had decent parents that would always try to do for me
4404876 from a young age i was taught right from wrong how to be a man to be a hard worker
4404877 one episode i lost my tooth and me and big bird had to go through sesame street and try to find it
4404878 he stood for something big he was for black culture i rhymed about beating people up about shooting at people trying to make money
4404879 we beat him up in the snow he was on drugs and he owed us money for dope so we kicked his ass
4404880 he was a fucking murderer what do you want me to say
4404881 i have other friends that are a little less organized with that shit he was a little more organized
4404882 weve been through so much hard times when we were both struggling we had each other to lean off of
4404883 it was a blizzard and snow was all over the windows so i couldnt see much
4404884 there were several different people shooting and the whole car was annihilated i dont know who shot me i was dealing and when you get to a certain plateau everyone knows you though you might not know who they are they think that doing something to you will benefit them whether its for a rep or financially
4404885 i consider him a brother to me and it shouldnt have gotten to the point where its at
4404886 sometimes the line of genius and acting crazy is so thin you might fall over the line and need someone to bring you back

4404903 i view midgets as saying hes big time and were small and he probably thinks crunk is like a fad so thats just his way of saying were out of here
4404904 i never looked at it like that if i want to dis niggas ill say it straight up
4404905 but if the shoe fit you know what im saying people can take it how they want to take it if somebody feels offended by it thats on they own self

4404910 i cant act like i dont have no love for him
4404911 i care about him so much that it caused the conflict that we have today the more i speak about him the more it becomes to the world like im bitter toward his success he was bound to be successful but the plan was for him to direct that success toward the others if our plan is to get up over a wall and i push you up and help you get over the wall and you dont throw a rope for me then its going to be an issue
4404912 its funny how once it gets to where the name is getting recognized everybody want to act like they got a problem with the villain

4404927 all the people on the sides know mf doom is hot mf doom is hot mf grimm is hot
4404928 it was good to see him rock and after that i thought we would be back to normal its apparent that he didnt think so
4404929 i think hes caught up in an image he cant escape from he has to be a villain
4404930 the whole villain thing is really like looking at how other people see him
4404931 the oppressors usually look at the people theyre oppressing as the villains but the oppressed are the heroes to the people so i just accept it now ill be the villain ill be the hero to the hip hop world

4404944 we are going to take every possible action with international support to oppose the ministers plan

4404954 lap dancing clubs are in contradiction to efforts to promote gender equality
4404955 yet by boxing lap dancing clubs into the same licensing category as cafes and concurrently requiring the promotion of gender equality the hands of local authorities have been tied
4404956 our towns and cities should be shaped as far as possible according to residents wishes not by the presence of unwanted lap dancing clubs in the heart of them
4404957 lap dance clubs fuel a sexist culture of treating women as sex objects areas surrounding lap dance clubs can become no go areas for women
4404958 the only viable solution is to license lap dancing clubs as sex encounter establishments

4404965 for the network and insight of other photographers while connecting with models muas
4404966 this is the best forum in san diego for models makeup artists and photographers to connect on both a social and professional level i urge anyone interrested in the area of modeling in any capacity to come to future meetings and to sign up as members
4404967 others should join to get valuable experience if they listened to the more experience photographers
4404968 this has the potential to be an excellent networking opportunity we need more models and more muas but overall its a great group
4404969 sport is all about one person trying to derail the other persons dreams its kind of the dog eat dog trend that sport is especially when you get up to higher levels like olympic games nobody knows what ive really gone through in the last eight years and whats gotten me to this point besides myself and a few people that i know well its my own personal deal at this point

4405135 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4405136 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4405137 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4405138 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4405139 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4405140 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4405141 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4405142 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4405143 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4405144 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

4405173 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4405174 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4405175 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4405176 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

4405203 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4405204 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

4405214 ive seen this before purusha plainly wasnt the so far like
4405215 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4405216 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4405217 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4405218 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4405219 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4405220 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4405221 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4405222 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4405223 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

4405225 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4405226 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care

4405228 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4405229 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4405230 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4405231 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4405232 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4405233 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4405234 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4405235 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4405236 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4405237 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4405238 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4405239 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4405240 if we start to interpret every matter can be broadened fighting and public demonstration can also he part of daily life
4405241 if we do not put our security perspectives in gear we may just be caught off guard

4405249 there is a heightened need for the unity cooperation of the milf and the national democratic front of the philippines in their distinct and common concerns and causes against the same adversaries
4405250 it is full of malice it is calculated to outwit and outflank the milf and the bangsamoro and to facilitate frontal military attacks against them they are being left no choice but to wage revolutionary struggle in order to advance their cause of national self determination
4405251 the patriotic and progressive forces and the people are reasonably concerned that the moa had been devised by the untrustworthy and sneaky arroyo as a way for pushing a charter change to allow her to stay in power beyond 2010 without really having to give substantial concessions to the milf
4405252 the milf can continue to use the moa as a standard or minimum basis for negotiating with the grp the grp or the arroyo regime can also use the same thing for putting off serious formal negotiations with the milf and for hyping the need for charter change
4405253 certainly such expectations can never be realized through the kindness of the us and the grp and without the persevering struggle of the moro people the grp and its imperialist masters are merely using the moa as a device of pretended generosity to milf in order to seize the propaganda initiative to prolong grp milf informal talks and ceasefire and to deploy larger us and philippine military forces against the milf and the bangsamoro
4405254 we appeal to all parties concerned to resolve the on going conflicts through peaceful means and to respect life and uphold the rights of all victims caught in the middle of this discord
4405255 we count on the lgus involved the national government civil society and the milf to take care of the special needs of women and children and in responding to the current situation
4405256 as the nations source of information we urge the mass media to practice conscientious responsible and accurate reporting
4405257 both the government forces and milf should ensure the enforcement of the ceasefire agreement at all times to prevent the increasing number of casualties and the economic setback brought forth by the ongoing conflict
4405258 a faxed copy of ra 6958 is definitely not a genuine document and therefore cannot be the subject of falsification within the statutory meaning of the law

4405274 that her girlfriend wants to go off and get married to some guy
4405275 sweetie can you go out and get something to take over to their house
4405276 i dont know but if he doesnt hell find out tonight
4405277 i remember the days when she couldnt even boil water
4405278 ta kun said you guys were holding hands when he answered the door
4405279 its early for her but she didnt take a nap today
4405280 sorry i couldnt get in here in time to stop the crying
4405281 because all for one amp one for all is getting a little sad
4405282 well i wanted to wait until noa gets older but i really want to come back
4405283 and then well have 6 kids 3 boys and 3 girls and theyll all be ridiculously attractive
4405284 but we dont have the right equipment to have babies together
4405285 i knew there were a lot of things going on and was aware rangers wanted me too it was an exciting time and there was a lot of tension but i feel i have made the right move
4405286 i have to be honest the champions league really appeals to me and i can get that opportunity with celtic
4405287 i see this as a massive step in my career in fact signing for celtic is the crowning moment of it so far but i have a lot of ambitions and know i can achieve them as a celtic player
4405288 it was what i wanted i am now ready to give everything for my new shirt
4405289 the intent of this ordinance is to smear protesters and make them appear as if theyre somehow criminal
4405290 whereas its a new venue its not a new challenge for us
4405291 it could be a real nightmare to get 76 000 people into invesco field
4405292 do we close the interstate or will the protesters thats a very big issue
4405293 if you identify the anarchists early and they engage in criminal behavior snatch them up right now
4405294 the further you delay the more damage they can do to the process of legitimate protest
4405295 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4405296 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4405297 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake

4405304 but the clear fact is we sent out on the website an honest statement by the chief executive martin bain explaining the situation
4405305 but then people want to read into it and put their own twist on it theres not a lot we can do

4405317 we followed up as many leads as we had we always considered moore a person of interest but back in 2003 we didnt have enough to make the case
4405318 the article came out in the paper and based on that we started getting new leads

4405327 this year youll see an even bigger difference because of the economy
4405328 this year the sales tax holiday is sure to be much needed and much appreciated by families shopping for school clothes and fall wardrobes
4405329 the main benefit is the tax savings on top of the fact that retailers have aggressive promotions
4405330 the holiday is always a good incentive to bring shoppers back downtown and take advantage of great offers that a lot of the stores have
4405331 downtown has everything from national retailers like bass shoes factory outlet chicos izod van heusen and a number of independents like douglas mens store footsies ha bas cruz cortez intima boutique nefertiti and many more
4405332 were expecting big crowds for the holiday weekend especially with gas prices right now
4405333 we would expect that a lot of people in the houston metro area who might have traveled further will take advantage of having great beaches and shopping on galveston island
4405334 in my mind it will stop the shredding of the fabric of our community we must put opportunities in front of our children so that they can go to work and earn a living
4405335 to object to what you call government welfare is your privilege but its not something i can agree with
4405336 i hope you recognize that all the people who have spoken are giving a consistent message we are united together

4405343 the micro projects programme management is yet to satisfactorily address these administrative concerns in the interim however programme management and the board are working with the ministry to resolve the issues
4405344 the ministry has indicated that this decision was taken in the interest of ensuring that on going micro projects are completed and that beneficiaries receive the anticipated level of support projected under the programme
4405345 if there is no sign of settlement at the next meeting then it would be procedurally prudent to refer the wage dispute to the next stage which is conciliation

4405356 it wasnt easy for nastia to be second but i never believed nastia was no 2

4405359 i just had to give it my all and hope it was enough
4405360 when i saw her score come up i knew i couldnt score six tenths higher

4405749 are straightforward fishes they have small pelvic fins retain fin rays in their paired appendages and have well developed gill arches suggesting that both animals remained mostly aquatic
4405750 a longer snout suggests a shift from sucking towards snapping up prey

4405793 the british market is incredibly difficult to work in because the fees for players and their wages are excessive what we do need to do as a club is increase our scouting network abroad
4405794 a lot of players enjoy being around bigger clubs even if they arent in the team
4405795 they enjoy the kudos and everything else that goes with it and dont fancy a battle at a club like stoke
4405796 that is one of the reasons we have to be very careful to attract the right players and right characters
4405797 it is over three weeks since we learned that the portuguese authorities had closed the investigation to find madeleine lifted our arguido status and ended judicial secrecy
4405798 we were surprised that copies of investigation files were given to the media the content of these files has been extensively reported it will be clear to everyone now that there is absolutely no evidence that suggests madeleine has been seriously harmed
4405799 knowing this we strongly believe that madeleine is out there and can be found of course whoever is responsible for madeleines abduction must and can be found to prevent them from putting another child and family through the misery we have suffered

4405910 the preacher said that jesus already became sin already became sin for me i grew up but i grew up torn and conflicted stealing my fathers belt hanging it my closet as a threat against what the hell i did it any way i followed the preachers and i followed the girls who came to revival meetings i tried to screw them but they were good southern girls who knew how to be coy who knew enough not to say anything and and i was clueless they said no they walked away fingering their silver rings i followed them home sitting in the trees and watched them with their boyfriends i wasnt coy with the preachers i didnt a have clue about my damned life and they knew that i didnt have a clue and they pushed for me to become like them i followed them thoughtlessly once i spoke with borrowed words it was supposed to be my testimony but stole it from a book its the story you heard earlier

4405916 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
4405917 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
4405918 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
4405919 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
4405920 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration

4405964 i continue to be very pleased with our revenue growth during these non seasonal quarters
4405965 sales during these quarters come almost entirely from our existing wholesale customers and as such act as a same store sales measurement tool
4405966 despite inflationary pressures and building inventory for the upcoming holiday season we continue to achieve solid improvements in our margins
4405967 once our peak season gets underway our investment in new sales territories and a beefed up inventory will turn into ever growing revenue
4405968 the win doesnt change too much really i still believe i am improving and learning more about the team and the car at each race
4405969 my aim for the last part of the season is to win more races and to perform regularly at the front
4405970 its something i was able to do from time to time in the first half of the year but i now feel more confident that i can be a consistent challenger in the remaining races and im really looking forward to that

4406185 you go through different stages throughout the race but towards the end of the run i was really loving it
4406186 at one point im sure i was running with my eyes closed but i didnt realise until i started to trip over my own feet
4406187 it just kept concentrating on the next couple of hours rather than the whole thing
4406188 most people think i have got a screw loose or that someone must have dropped me on my head as a baby but every time i have completed one of these things i want to push myself one step further
4406189 before each race you start to worry that you might not have done enough training or might not be able to do the distance but i dont like giving in and i keep thinking positive breaking the race up in to small pieces and nibbling away at small sections of it

4406197 it is a terrible situation we were promised toilets in our homes when we moved here four years ago but weve received nothing from the thabazimbi municipality
4406198 you can imagine what this does to our health especially that of young children who play in the veld accidentally step on the faeces and then walk back into the house
4406199 when i asked the contractor who laid the sewerage pipes why he was not installing toilets he said he had stopped working because the municipality owes him r2million
4406200 the municipality does not want us to dig our own pit toilets
4406201 its a shame that we have to live like this
4406202 i dont even get visitors because they say they cant visit a place with no ablution facilities
4406203 it will cost the municipality r3 5million to install the toilets
4406204 we have written to the provincial government and local mining companies for help

4406211 a safer alternative to vehicles not classified as a school bus but which are still used to transport groups of school aged passengers to sporting events community activities or other such educational or child care facilities and outings
4406212 not just in the school industry but in other areas
4406213 it is wrong to say certain segments of the market are immune to economic downturns in the market as far as were concerned
4406214 its not really a straightforward comparison because were in the middle of adding models
4406215 we have definitely seen some of our clients suffer in this economy i would never make a broad statement that our clients are immune to whats going on or not sensitive to the plight of others we are up and up significantly because people are very loyal to the ownership experience and we have a very high repurchase rate
4406216 it wasnt that long ago that the u s was 60 of our global sales

4406253 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4406254 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4406255 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4406256 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4406257 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4406258 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4406259 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4406260 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4406261 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4406262 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4406263 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4406264 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4406265 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4406266 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4406267 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4406268 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4406269 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4406270 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4406271 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4406272 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4406273 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4406274 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4406275 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4406276 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

4406321 it is disappointing that the issues with this years national curriculum test results have meant that the partnership between qca and ets europe must end early
4406322 ets europe has apologised to schools for the delays in marking national curriculum assessments in england as a subsidiary of a global non profit company we are dedicated to assuring quality and equity for all pupils and we are sorry that the results this summer were delayed for some schools
4406323 however we would argue that the quality of the marking is high due to the stringent new checks that we introduced this year
4406324 but i think hes planning on factoring that in as like a major factor
4406325 i think the audience would be insulted if you did because then you feel this obvious pressure to appeal

4406328 it is over three weeks since we learned that the portuguese authorities had closed the investigation to find madeleine lifted our arguido status and ended judicial secrecy
4406329 we were surprised that copies of investigation files were given to the media the content of these files has been extensively reported it will be clear to everyone now that there is absolutely no evidence that suggests madeleine has been seriously harmed
4406330 knowing this we strongly believe that madeleine is out there and can be found of course whoever is responsible for madeleines abduction must and can be found to prevent them from putting another child and family through the misery we have suffered

4406478 mea has extended this olive branch and unfortunately the alaska energy authority responded with a wood chipper

4406480 they kept telling me how small it was but this is good
4406481 we invite a lot of parent innovations like volunteer art classes and we work as a team with the teachers
4406482 we know we need gas we understand that but were back to the old what is responsible development
4406483 yes we need gas wells here but not next to houses the pressure is going to be unbelievable as energy prices rise
4406484 the thing is theres already statutes and regulations in place that govern those things
4406485 so any time you add more to it then it doesnt make it any easier the state in particular has some pretty stringent regs
4406486 those firms that take a look at it apply and get the permits are actually the firms wed like to have here
4406487 by working through the process they acknowledge they have to be good neighbors

4406489 we need something thats sustainable so we can continue to build that infrastructure
4406490 the more you expand the power grid the more it lowers everybodys cost
4406491 we came up with a plan that served the communitys needs

4406501 at the end of the day he was stronger and better
4406502 i was penalised for holding but it was early enough and at the same time i deserved it you know he was always in my face and i didnt know what to do
4406503 actually johnny was fortunate when you look at it because the referee was pretty lenient after that
4406504 when we were in close he was working so hard i thought he could have been given a warning for his head his head was in my face the whole time but the referee only looked at me thats the way it is
4406505 its hard for johnny at the moment he is going to be down for a long long time ive been through this myself so i know what its like
4406506 i know when i lost i cried for a week in seoul it feels like the end of the world and it should feel that way because its not pretty to lose and you shouldnt be happy when you do he shouldnt be going around partying with a smile on his face he should be sick to his teeth
4406507 ive to stick around now and watch all this boxing
4406508 four years i have to wait around now no way of knowing

4406513 why do i ever need to peel and seed a tomato
4406514 tomatoes may be frozen whole sliced chopped or pur ed additionally you can freeze them raw or cooked as juice or sauce or prepared in the recipe of your choice thawed raw tomatoes may be used in any cooked tomato recipe do not try to substitute them for fresh tomatoes however since freezing causes their texture to become mushy tomatoes should be seasoned just before serving rather than before freezing freezing may either strengthen or weaken seasonings such as garlic onion and herbs preparation select firm ripe tomatoes for freezing sort the tomatoes discarding any that are spoiled wash them in clean water dry them by blotting with a clean cloth or paper towels freezing whole tomatoes with peels prepare tomatoes as described above cut away the stem place the uncut tomatoes on cookie sheets and freeze tomatoes do not need to be blanched link before freezing once frozen transfer the tomatoes from the cookie sheets into freezer bags or other containers seal tightly to use the frozen tomatoes remove them from the freezer a few at a time or all at once to peel just run a frozen tomato under warm water in the kitchen sink its skin will slip off easily freezing peeled tomatoes if you prefer to freeze peeled tomatoes you can wash the tomatoes and then dip them in boiling water for about 1 minute or until the skins split peel and then freeze as noted above for more information on freezing tomatoes check this link to the national center for home food preservation hosted by the university of georgia cooperative extension service storage time to extend the time frozen foods maintain good quality package foods in material intended for freezing that means proper freezer bags not just any bag thats left over from the produce section of the grocery store keep the temperature of the freezer at 0 degrees f or below it is generally recommended frozen vegetables be eaten within about 8 months for best quality

4406543 the talks never collapsed and all parties are committed to the dialogue i would also want to confirm commitment to see the talks end successfully sooner rather than later
4406544 you have tsvangirais backers who are playing hardball and insisting on the virtual disappearance of robert mugabe and youve got robert mugabes backers insisting he remains maintains some kind of executive powers
4406545 we cannot continue wandering around without direction hence the need to swear in parliamentarians and open the house so that the elected members can continue to fulfil their constitutional mandate

4406605 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them

4406609 we will continue to reduce the number of british troops in iraq
4406610 of course future decisions will be based as i have always said on the advice of our military commanders on the ground

4406613 fmit has admitted it made an improper investment from funds that were borrowed from the state government for upgrades to irrigation systems but were instead invested in the us subprime mortgage market
4406614 due to the failures in the us subprime market the value of this investment has decreased by approximately 2 million
4406615 theyve acted contrary to our wishes and possibly in an illegal manner so weve been the victim of potentially a fraud
4406616 to have a collective punishment for our ratepayers removing their legal right to elect their directors just seems a gross overreaction

4406626 i appeal for the help of every civilized person in the world to stop this uncivilized barbarian inhuman treacherous absolutely outrageous behavior and to save innocent lives
4406627 the fact that the biggest number of bombs fell on purely economic and civilian targets clearly indicated that was a premeditated thing and it had nothing to do only with abkhazia or south ossetia
4406628 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4406629 the siding was the first to go then they took the fence then they broke in and took everything else

4406641 as we have gone through this season we have become more settled and confident
4406642 croke park is the biggest stage of all and its where players really want to produce their best if we can manage this then we will hopefully be in with a great chance of reaching the semi finals
4406643 we have a lot of boys who have been there before and know what it is all about so we are not unduly worried but we do know that dublin will be very formidable opponents you have to consider that they have won four leinster titles on the trot and in the process they must have been tested on occasions yet they were able to pass those tests
4406644 there is a big level of expectation surrounding this dublin team and they will be going flat out we have to be ready for this
4406645 we obviously were hoping to avoid the qualifier route but we have watched tyrones progress and we know they are going to very difficult opponents
4406646 i enjoy the involvement at midfield we know though that it will take a massive effort on the part of our team as a whole if we are to win tomorrow
4406647 the points didnt go for me in the last round i knew i wouldnt get the decision unless i knocked him out
4406648 the scoring here is so bad for the olympics it is unbelievable even though i know ive had better days i still thought my performance was exceptional and i should have won six or seven points with some good body shots
4406649 it is not enough to say that some of the scoring here over the last few days has been outrageous
4406650 it is going beyond that its as though they are trying to destroy boxing in the olympics far too many shots arent even registering
4406651 it has become almost physically painful to watch fighters going for what they believe is the chance of their life times and then seeing the ridiculous results of their efforts flashing up on the tv screen
4406652 we had no serious thought that the japanese would accept our proposal
4406653 but we just couldnt get into the game the koreans were so quick and i think her serve is probably the best in the world it was so flat we just couldnt get it back
4406654 pre occupied with the pursuit of justice it became his life

4406656 he never drank before very much maybe at a wedding or something at the beginning he wasnt too bad
4406657 then he was on tablets but hed go into fits of temper he stopped taking them then he turned to alcohol
4406658 i used to tell people i had four children and michael was the naughtiest of the lot he was always with the children and playing tricks on me hes not like that now hes very aggressive very bad tempered he doesnt sleep well he thinks hes our boss he demands things if he goes to meetings and things dont go right its as if it is our fault
4406659 i was on a country road driving like a lunatic hoping a tractor would come out in front of me to end it all i cried until i had ulcers in my eyes i couldnt stop i must have cried for three months
4406660 i dont go to bed anymore because i dont want to wake up to nothing in the morning
4406661 i tried to keep going but its lonely without anne that is when my hatred started i hated those people so much and never hated anyone in my life every day since that day i have been so angry im sorry but thats just the way i feel
4406662 i cant get it out of my mind when i was helping someone else i wasnt there for my brother i have a problem with that im very pessimistic about life i was helping someone else when he needed help i find that hard to live with
4406663 we are fielding a relatively young side with a lot of our new players included bath are a strong side and we are hoping to learn a lot from this game we have worked really hard during the pre season months and put new systems in place so i am looking forward to watching the team play we all really enjoyed the supporters event on tuesday night and i know the players are really keen to start this season well and give all those supporters something to cheer about
4406664 the guys coming in from the southern hemisphere were halfway through a season and needed to get out and play more games while the guys here have had their close and pre season and have worked hard along with the new signings during the summer and its important that they get some game time
4406665 its important that we have a top line game to open with and bath are quality you want to pit yourselves against the best
4406666 its the time of year when supporters can simply come along and enjoy the rugby we will be doing things like running a penalty when you may normally kick it as there arent the same pressures on you as in a league or cup game
4406667 it will be hard facing ulster jerseys instead of playing with them but i am pleased my first experience in bath colours will be in familiar surroundings for me
4406668 coming to the guinness premiership is a big challenge for me and my time at ulster was a great experience for me and was very rewarding for me it was about looking for a change a new opportunity and a chance to expose myself to a lot of risk
4406669 i have to live for four years with what i did today
4406670 hopefully ill come back but its hard im young but four years is a long time away you dont know whats going to happen sure you dont know whats going to happen tomorrow
4406671 at the end of the day he was stronger and better
4406672 i was penalized for holding but it was early enough and at the same time i deserved it you know he was always in my face and i didnt know what to do
4406673 actually johnny was fortunate when you look at it because the referee was pretty lenient after that
4406674 when we were in close he was working so hard
4406675 i thought he could have been given a warning for his head his head was in my face the whole time but the referee only looked at me thats the way it is thats boxing

4406949 hubo sospechas en muchas partes del mundo rabe y entre sectores del pueblo estadunidense de que estados unidos hab a ido a la guerra con irak precisamente para asegurarse la riqueza petrolera que esos contratos intentan extraer
4406950 extraer la riqueza de irak en un acuerdo c lebre por su explotaci n
4406951 destinado a establecer alguna instalaci n militar o base con el prop sito de proveer el emplazamiento permanente de las fuerzas armadas de estados unidos en irak
4406952 ejercer el control de los recursos petroleros de irak por parte de estados unidos
4406953 claramente respald al primer ministro maliki y al gobierno iraqu contra lo que calific de grupos armados ilegales del ej rcito del mehdi de sadr en el reciente conflicto en basora
4406954 y eso no es sorprendente dado que su principal representante en irak el consejo supremo isl mico domina el estado iraqu y es el principal respaldo de maliki

4406960 im a decent and good person and have done a lot for the community
4406961 but the dream gave this message because even though i knew the information i have not acted on it
4406962 im a bed the man is in a hospital so he needs a bed to lie on im the bed
4406963 the dream is a theater in which the dreamer is the scene the player the prompter the producer the author the public and the critic all the figures in the dream are personified features of the dreamers own personality
4406964 the dream does not conceal we simply do not understand the language
4406965 he is a bear before he drinks his morning coffee
4406966 this whole dream could be interpreted on a deeper level but this interpretation is valid dont worry about getting things on the deepest level just accept things at whatever level is comfortable for you your life can work on any one of a number of levels all levels are good
4406967 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4406968 that choice will end his bid for the presidency and spell defeat for other republican candidates
4406969 hes not even sure christian conservatives would vote for him let alone work for him if he picked a pro abortion running mate
4406970 a good portion of us were urging him to pick a pro life running mate
4406971 that choice would go a long way to solidify his credentials
4406972 wrong headed short sighted fracture the republican party and not allow us to capitalize on the democratic partys fracture right now
4406973 if he does that it makes our job 100 times harder it would dampen enthusiasm at a time when evangelicals are looking for ways to gin up enthusiasm
4406974 some people in the movement say it would be the kiss of death he heard that in the room last night
4406975 youre going to have to have a huge turnout of that base again for mccain to win
4406976 ninety percent of the workforce for bush in 04 came out of that constituency
4406977 picking a ridge or a joseph lieberman would not be helpful at all
4406978 the point that mccain was making is that people can differ on one issue and still be a vital member of our party
4406979 the fact that governor ridge is not perfectly in line with the party platform does not make him any less of a republican
4406980 the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4406981 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out for vice president
4406982 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that
4406983 this move to a pro choice running mate such as lieberman could help reshape his message to appeal to swing voters
4406984 the right wing is not going anywhere and choice is a key issue for over 40 women who voted for hillary in the primaries
4406985 a lot of the troops here are on the fence or disappointed

4406992 do you think rocking in a chairll make you lose weight
4406993 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defense system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4406994 republican presidential candidate john mccain now enjoys a healthy 88 7 percent lead over barack obama among republicans

4407002 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4407003 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4407004 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4407005 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4407006 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4407007 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4407008 the prime minister never offered to absorb 20 000 refugees in israel the prime minister again reiterates that under any future agreement there will not be any return of palestinian refugees to israel in any number

4407017 on setting up diplomatic relations between the two countries at the level of ambassadors
4407018 one of the steps that has long been required is the establishment of a proper embassy for syria in lebanon and vice versa
4407019 now if the syrians will go ahead and demarcate the border between lebanon and syria and respect lebanons sovereignty in other ways then this will have proved to be a very good step
4407020 to reactivate the work of the joint committee to demarcate the lebanese syrian borders within a mechanism and a set of priorities
4407021 it is not possible to mark the borders in shebaa farms as long as there is still israeli occupation the occupation must end
4407022 to activate and step up the work of the joint committee on people missing from both countries
4407023 cast a shadow over our efforts to normalise ties with pakistan
4407024 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated

4407051 kick anyones ass who said halo 3 wasnt the greatest game ever made
4407052 i will try and stay here all day but the police are going to try and remove me
4407053 but the police have been very very good about it very supportive
4407054 we need open courts where the truth can come out
4407055 i think you can expect to see us gold medal competitive in about eight events which is phenomenal
4407056 and because of the previous performances at the world championships we are odds on favourite and whichever way you look at it you cant avoid that
4407057 its a combination of money the right people the best equipment and just a very positive mentality
4407058 sane is concerned that more than twice as many young men were admitted as young women which suggests men may be more likely to self medicate with illicit drugs to manage their emotional distress
4407059 many of these admissions may be related to other pre existing mental health problems such as depression or feelings of alienation for which we need much earlier intervention and support when families and others express their concerns
4407060 this bulletin paints a picture of wide discrepancy between the number of men who take are treated or even die from drug use compared to the number of women
4407061 if he wasnt in this sport i dont think id be as good

4407063 i thought i could hang on and thats all i wanted to do
4407064 while recent studies have found that households are not generally knowledgeable about personal finance issues we wanted to know whether they have a good gut sense of their own retirement preparedness
4407065 we found that nearly 60 percent do and nearly 40 percent do not some worry too much some worry too little
4407066 future savings may not be the top priority for many households they may be focused on more pressing concerns with the current economic climate crunching americans sense of financial security its understandable many are focused on making ends meet in the short term yet its important to prioritize and reorganize rather than eliminate your savings habits careful planning that addresses short term concerns while still working toward long term goals is crucial to surviving tough economic times
4407067 i think the sentence is a bit light he should face a harsher sentence because he has committed a crime against a child
4407068 i dont think its coming down as fast as it should be
4407069 shetlanders are still paying a far higher price than anywhere else in the country and as oil prices reduce we are the last to see any benefit from that
4407070 we seem to be the last people to see the benefits despite having sullom voe on our doorstep this forces the argument that the competition authorities if they are worth anything should be fully investigating
4407071 i think the uk government dont give a damn about the highlands and islands the scottish government keep writing to the chancellor but he keeps ignoring them and we could do with a coherent argument made by everyone to the competition authorities if they find as i think that we are being ripped off then the government have to take some action
4407072 i wouldnt even like to guess what thats going to cost us
4407073 the cost of manufacturing in the islands is going through the roof as well as across the whole of britain
4407074 the industry has taken a bad knock for a lot of years
4407075 now i think theres the first sight of a light at the end of the tunnel after a long period of very bad prices this whole period has been so demoralising
4407076 i can detect from speaking to folk theyve just had enough now the price will be better this year but i hope its not too late i would like to encourage them to hang in there and the council to look at ways of helping this industry
4407077 i go around the country areas a fair bit and you can see good stockmen from fair isle to flugga as they say but there is a lot of land now thats very scarce of stock
4407078 im not wanting to go back to that at all i want to go back to quality to increase the size of the shetland native sheep
4407079 the cross ewes can produce something to sell whether it be slaughtered at home or be sold for slaughter or for finishing further away
4407080 this would be a sustainable investment if some way can be found in investing in this industry again
4407081 hes doing a tremendous job with what hes producing but hes not alone there are a lot of those guys around who would do it if they could just see that it could work and give them a little income out of it i think they need support the council or the government needs to look at this we cant continue this deterioration in numbers everywhere
4407082 theres thousands of acres of land thats been reseeded that needs helping again and areas thats needing to be improved very much in the remote areas
4407083 the pacific fleet headquarters has received official notification that warships from the united states and great britain will not arrive at the port in vladivostok therefore these warships will not take part in the exercise
4407084 this was the use of sophisticated weapons against a small town against a sleeping people this was a barbaric assault
4407085 only now theyre beginning to show some pictures of the destruction so this looks to me like it was a well prepared project they wanted to put the blame on russia
4407086 this is the man mr gorbachev who helped to you know bring down kgb kingdom and he is the one who is you know justifying what the kgb people are doing right now in my country
4407087 the whole stadium chanted for the entire match anti russian slogans
4407088 afterwards the polish journalists just talked politics and forgot all about the game

4407091 as worldwide demand for sustainable seafood from aquaculture is increasing this new vision will help to promote the sector as a long term viable business
4407092 shetlands fishing industry has undergone many changes especially over the last 50 years or so arguably the pelagic sector has seen some of the most dramatic changes
4407093 these have included the change from traditional drift nets to purse seines and then pelagic trawls the collapse and recovery of its principal target species herring and increasingly stringent management measures under the european common fisheries policy
4407094 pelagic processing in shetland has also seen huge changes over this period culminating in the development of the shetland catch factory
4407095 one of the main aims of the project will be to record the changes that have taken place in the pelagic industry an important element will be recording the recollections of the people that were and are involved in the industry
4407096 despite the importance of the fishing industry to shetland very little information has been recorded about its recent history previous studies of fishing in shetland have tended to concentrate on the 19th century or at the most no later that the inter war period
4407097 this project will help fill an important gap in our records and we are very grateful for the financial support which has made it possible
4407098 reading about the efforts of volunteers to sustain and develop their communities is always humbling and the judges had a particularly difficult task in narrowing down a shortlist

4407102 there have been lots of things that have dampened down spirits but it seems to have gone fairly well this year most things are of a pretty good standard
4407103 it demonstrates the amount of time and dedication that folk have to put in to enter stuff for the show
4407104 there is a lot of preparation and a lot of commitment
4407105 its her size and shape that made her stand out
4407106 the standard of the sheep in general has really been very high
4407107 i didnt hold up much hope of winning it with the quality of the other competitors surely the judge likes big suffolks so this ewe fitted the bill
4407108 shell be retiring now but hopefully her gimmer will be here another year as a ewe
4407109 i was very pleased because the standard i was competing against was very good
4407110 it is time consuming with garden flowers you never can be sure of what will be available so you just have to make the best of what you get

4407147 individuals who abuse spouse or offspring or who fail to fulfil family responsibilities will one day stand accountable before god
4407148 i would like to encourage churches in these circumstances to not endeavour to deal with these things in house they are ill equipped to do so and there are better and wiser courses to follow
4407149 three women said it was the same for them and that it was their role one said she hates her husband but continues to stay
4407150 they are to be constantly smiling over their family of five they are supposed to take supper across the street to an ill neighbour and then put up with their husband when he comes home from work and smile about it the whole time to be a good mother and wife women have to put on this mask of perfection they cant show their tears depression or agony
4407151 i remember running away i didnt have anywhere to go but i just decided i needed to run away i took two things with me and i wished id used them the first was a book of mormon like a bible the second was a razor blade i was going to kill myself i wanted him to kill me
4407152 he told social welfare that id recanted about the men having sex with me i didnt at all i wasnt asked or talked to social welfare left it up to the church to look into it and they didnt even talk to me
4407153 he didnt beat me around the face he used to throw me around the room bang me against the wall slam me into doors slammed doors on me hes tried to run me over with a car
4407154 i got out of the bath and said look look at this he took it from me and flushed it down the toilet
4407155 his whole reason for marrying was to become a bishop you cant be a bishop if youre not married
4407156 i slapped him once it felt so good i slapped him again
4407157 physical violence is a problem for monica who had previously been in hospital for injuries sustained during assaults
4407158 the day that i actually left he slammed me up against the lounge wall
4407159 please dont hit mum daddy please dont hit any more
4407160 that was it for me i gathered up some clothes and food and we went to a ladys place and we rang womens refuge
4407161 i was going to save our marriage make myself safe and he will become a better husband
4407162 the post traumatic stress disorder examination conducted in april 2002 indicated monica had severe symptoms flashbacks nightmares hypervigilance heightened arousal avoidance of stimulae that triggers memories
4407163 she continues to be afraid she will be controlled and possibly physically harmed by him
4407164 the churchs principal concern now is the needs of the women to whom you referred the invitation stands for them always if they would like to meet and discuss with their relief society president the female leader in their congregation or meet and discuss with their minister or have access to an alternative leader away from where they live if this makes them more comfortable or have a referral to lds social services and the counselling service through the church
4407165 by and large the leaders deal effectively with the issues they face nevertheless as imperfect people there will be some instances that are not handled perfectly
4407166 individuals who abuse spouse or offspring or who fail to fulfil family responsibilities will one day stand accountable before god
4407167 un jugador que es un 5 no muy alto pero que su capacidad f sica le da bastantes opciones tiene buena mano de 3 4 metros es explosivo en el 1x1 muy buen reboteador ofensivo y detr s puede defender perfectamente a un 4 o un 5 porque es fuerte f sicamente su corpulencia f sica hace que pueda aguantar p vots m s grandes y su rapidez de piernas hace que pueda defender a 4 m s r pidos
4407168 in think in the first half that the defense played very solid football
4407169 you cant have that many drops and expect to move the ball consistently and we have to cut down on the penalties
4407170 for me it was about working on ball placement i just tried to get the ball in a position where they could come down with it and possibly pick up yards
4407171 severe conditions advising fans to take cover in the concourses
4407172 i wouldnt have been upset if they had called it its dangerous out here with lightning
4407173 in the past few months and particularly over the summer we have seen increasing signs that this parliament is really not working very well any more it is becoming increasingly dysfunctional
4407174 quite frankly im going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively
4407175 governing is more than not just being defeated in the house its also being able to pass legislation
4407176 this is the prime minister who made a virtue of passing fixed election date legislation and now hes threatening to cross sussex drive and go see his neighbour the governor general and ask for an election because hes fabricating a crisis where none exists
4407177 na het incident met moncassin was tom opgejaagd wild ik heb hem toen voorgesteld om uit te blazen in mijn vakantiehuis in frankrijk
4407178 volgens de getuigenissen die ik later in het dorp heb gehoord hebben mijn franse wielervrienden zich uitstekend geamuseerd met tom

4407202 fermi tutti attenti a fare diagnosi sbagliate come quella di famiglia cristiana
4407203 si usava il termine fascista quando eravamo studenti per indicare chiunque non avesse le nostre idee racconta ricolfi nel suo articolo dal titolo
4407204 le diagnosi che parlano di quel che sta avvenendo in italia come una rinascita del fascismo sotto altre forme sostenuta dal settimanale cattolico e ripresa dai 26 mezzibusti non mi convincono per niente
4407205 chi ragiona cos sostiene ricolfi dimentica due cose molte delle misure rimproverate al governo sono comunque analoghe a misure dello stesso tipo adottate nei principali paesi occidentali la seconda che la gente comune vede n tali misure semplicemente un modo per invertire il lungo trend di lassismo e superficialit che ha informato lazione di tutti i governi da molto tempo a questa parte
4407206 il fascismo non centra per nulla ed un peccato che a sinsistra siano in pochi a riconoscerlo francamente e senza mezzi termini
4407207 quel che centra prosegue nella sua analisi ricolfi la lenta ma solida crescita in italia di una domanda di autorit che contagia anche il popolo di sinistra e che consegna permanentemente i voti e legemonia alla destra
4407208 ma e qui ricolfi da una stoccata allopposizione autorit nel lessico infantile sic della sinistra significa autoritarismo e autoritarismo uguale fascismo

4407228 i love being a spartan its been a honor and a privilege coaching here for 32 years
4407229 but i think there is a point in everyones life that it is time to step aside and let a young vibrant energetic enthusiastic coach like damon rensing is take the program over and give the program all that energy and enthusiasm it deserves
4407230 for more than four decades joe baums dedication to the sport of soccer and to michigan state university has been remarkable
4407231 along the way he has become synonymous with the spartan soccer program
4407232 its really been a whirlwind for me it feels like i have been through a lot in the last year and a half or so but you live and you learn
4407233 but i am really happy where i am at right now i am probably having the most fun i have had playing football since my senior year of high school
4407234 when i committed here i felt like it was a little hyped up and fans turned around on me real fast
4407235 i have always been a guy who wants to show people wrong so i kind of feel like im the underdog a little bit it is motivation for sure
4407236 i am really enjoying myself im glad i made the trip back home
4407237 the most enjoyable part of being here is putting on that green helmet and having that spartan logo on your pants it was a feeling i have been dreaming about since i was a little kid
4407238 obviously keith cant play this year but he is learning the system learning the offense
4407239 nichol and backup kirk cousins are both doing a great job
4407240 thats an ongoing battle everyday and i have been really pleased with both of them
4407241 joel foreman has continued to improve and mike bacon is backing up at center so those guys are rotating and taking a lot of reps in practice and i feel comfortable with both guys in there at left guard right now
4407242 those two are battling it out still when you got a situation like that you keep your carrot dangling a little bit
4407243 you make sure both of them can do the right things but those two guys have been battling pretty well in there
4407244 i was planing on going to western michigan to just be a student
4407245 then msu assistant don treadwell called my football coach slash athletic director and talked to him and said they were interested so we sent him some film they went over it liked it and they gave me a call back

4407264 people are trafficked due to lack of employment education and social problems and dropping out of school they are normally people who are known to them too
4407265 the victims are especially young women aged between 18 and 25
4407266 some leave their homes to take up a job as child minders but on their arrival their identity documents are confiscated and they are not allowed to communicate with their families for the duration of the contract then they are forced into prostitution or bonded labour
4407267 each country which accedes to the protocol has to in accordance with its means provide measures to protect and assist victims train law enforcement and border officials inform and educate victims potential victims and the general public
4407268 these result areas now form the basis for the programme of assistance to prevent and react to trafficking in persons and will contribute to the development of a national action plan nap as required by the palermo protocol
4407269 prosecutions have proceeded on an ad hoc basis overtly demonstrable to the facts such as kidnapping indecent assault and rape which do not individually attract as heavy sentences as a specific trafficking in persons would impose
4407270 the absence of legislation also limits prosecutors to dealing with only the perpetrator directly linked to the offences resulting from the trafficking of the victim to the exclusion of the perpetrators behind the scenes as this is often an organised crime activity
4407271 in response to this better coordination was needed to turn them from victims into survivors victims of trafficking will not be prosecuted
4407272 our challenge is to ensure that households know about these programmes and can access them and the poor have social networks to help break the poverty cycle
4407273 through this campaign we will ensure that the relevant implementing departments or agencies follow up poor households in need of services that they are eligible for
4407274 we appeal to individuals within households social movements civil society groups and businesses in the country and faith organisations to join hands in this war our collective efforts have changed south africa for the better once before lets do it again
4407275 if we make a success of this initiative in xhariep district in the free state the example can be emulated throughout the country
4407276 patients and families affected by terminal and incurable illnesses should expect appropriate pain relief including morphine
4407277 the centre sets a benchmark for the region through evidence based research training and service delivery
4407278 we are working towards producing the necessary expertise and knowledge to empower other provinces to follow suit
4407279 the approach focuses on symptom management such as relieving pain and enhancing the quality of life and psychosocial needs
4407280 we hope the centre will pave way for a new approach to the management of life terminal illnesses particularly the pain diagnosis when doctors says sorry theres nothing more we can do we want to remind people that palliative care says there is everything we can do and eliminate the feeling of despair
4407281 we understand the shelters cannot be kept open permanently but there should be a delay in dismantling them our argument is that we want this process to be lawful and to be conducted orderly
4407282 we want the provincial government to properly explain its reintegration policy thoroughly to the displaced people
4407283 last night i massaged my gf all over her body with the finest chinese wine then we made passionate love and i made her scream non stop for five minutes
4407284 last night in the shower i dropped a bar of soap in front of my bf he bent over and i made him scream for fifteen minutes straight
4407285 thats nothing last night i massaged my wife all over her body with gula melaka i caressed her entire body with it then ate her and i made her scream for two long hours
4407286 what did you do to make her scream for two hours
4407287 the main focus of the programme is to reconstruct inappropriate schools structures while alleviating poverty through job creation skills development and local economic development

4407299 they dont understand that theres this nonprofit organization los gatos music and arts that donates to the venue and the museums the long term goal is to do more around music and arts in los gatos
4407300 the most important thing is that the arts help to define us as human beings
4407301 lets face it music and art of any kind are important to being well rounded it helps us be a better community whether its rockn roll or swing music
4407302 what makes los gatos attractive what makes us special is everything from interesting art galleries to innovative businesses and free concerts its no wonder people come here to visit and to live
4407303 all you have to do is say i can do something
4407304 i like to play with different types of materials pearls and stones and glass
4407305 we have quite a few painters two pottery artists photographers and some weavers
4407306 theres even a man who does sculptures out of recyclable materials los gatos has a nice reputation so the show has a nice variety of different things
4407307 none of the art is mass produced or manufactured and its all the artists own work we also like the fact that the artists are there
4407308 by keeping it small we keep the quality up the artists are reviewed very strongly
4407309 i cut the log in half and make a rough bowl and then i turn it and then i put it in the freezer
4407310 after i retired i wanted to get more involved in art
4407311 but i was no longer interested in working with clay a friend took me to a woodworking show in san mateo and introduced me to wood turning i was immediately hooked
4407312 dio deka is making lamb and beef kabobs chicago steak house which hasnt even opened yet is making pork burgers and beef skewers valerianos crimson trevese and dolce spazio will also be there its not your usual carnival fare
4407313 the restaurants are competing with each other but there will be hotdogs and burgers too
4407314 were hoping to raise about 14 000 which is about 10 percent of our annual budget
4407315 the best part is just seeing the crowd enjoying the atmosphere looking at art listening to music and sipping wine
4407316 we give between 9 000 and 10 000 in scholarships to los gatos and saratoga high school students we also give another 8 000 or 9 000 to students from what we call our turn around school program these are kids who are flunking or getting a d minus in their freshman or sophomore year and who at the end of their junior or senior year something really clicks and theyre going to graduate its a really cool program
4407317 its a different atmosphere than most festivals theres a built in ambience having it on the lawn area is a huge plus
4407318 theres no way you should be able to eat what michael phelps eats this is not even a normal athlete i would not recommend this kind of diet for even a fit and serious competitor in say a 10km road race this man is in a very very different place to the rest of us hes 6ft 4in and 192lb of pure joy from a female perspective obviously though i probably shouldnt say that
4407319 after a 4 500 short course yards moderate morning practice
4407320 warm up 800 mixer on 10 30 4x150 kick on 2 30 50 stroke 50 free 50 stroke 400 pull with buoy on 5 00 breathe 3 5 7 9 by 100 200 stroke on 3 00 10x50 on 45 2 25kick 25drill 2 25free 25stroke 1 stroke main set 4x50 on 1 30 1x50 1 20 1x50 1 10 1x50 1 00 1x50 0 50 1x50 0 40 1x50 0 30 long swim down 100 200 300 pull lungbusters by quarters 400 choice kick 300 200 100 im drills
4407321 say hes doing about four miles a session and a couple of sessions a day
4407322 plus his land training id say hes burning maybe 5 000 calories in training and maybe 2 500 simply to sustain himself something like 8 000 a day in all mind you he is a very big bloke i havent looked at his schedules but 12 000 seems a lot
4407323 ive worked with extreme athletes triathletes for example who work phenomenally hard who expend between 6 000 and 10 000 calories a day
4407324 i can believe someone like phelps is getting through 12 000 and the point is its plainly working for him isnt it nobody could say hes not performing well hes quite clearly expending what hes consuming and just like all of us thats what counts
4407325 it does look quite salty quite fatty not very high in good fibre or in fruit and veg hes certainly not getting his five a day
4407326 i would certainly have expected him to be eating a bit less fat and its all saturated fat the wrong kind i suppose the point with an athlete like phelps though is that he needs a very high calorie intake but a very low volume whereas with the rest of us its the precise reverse we need a low calorie intake and high volume
4407327 and hes going to be burning them at a truly phenomenal rate theres protein in there too obviously which he needs to maintain and repair muscle mass and tissue but for someone like him in a sport like his its really a question of how many carbohydrates he can get in as quickly as possible so this diet might look very high in fat but if he had to eat this same number of calories in a diet that contained for example more fruit and vegetables hed simply never manage it his body just couldnt hold it his intestines would give up hes lucky as it is that he doesnt have a sensitive digestive system thats one of the myriad factors that contribute to make him the exceptional performer he is
4407328 most have been training since they were children remember and its a very difficult transition to make they have to be very very careful because theyre going to be cutting their level of activity to maybe a fifth and their diet has to change accordingly
4407329 i might design him a similar diet but with a bit more fibre maybe wholegrain pastas and bread its plainly not affecting his performance but many people would be constipated on a diet like that that said we all have different needs the important thing for right now is that what hes eating works hes like a turbo powered engine revved up to maximum speed and thats the only reason hes burning it all up different athletes handle carbohydrates differently hes obviously converting them very very effectively but its not a sustainable diet long term
4407330 look he needs these vast amounts of carbohydrates simply to get through the training sessions let alone compete
4407331 he eats swims and sleeps and thats about it when it comes to carbs hes in burn mode most of us particularly the couch potatoes are in storage mode and it really wouldnt do to be storing what youve just eaten on a regular basis
4407332 the good lesson for the rest of us in all this
4407333 is that if we do increase our level of physical activity we can afford to relax a little with the diet if we go to the gym or exercise regularly we can allow ourselves the odd little treat a lot of people make that mistake they think theyve got to deny themselves everything vaguely sinful its not the case
4407334 the average person is going to burn about 400 calories
4407335 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4407336 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more

4407338 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4407339 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4407340 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4407341 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4407342 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4407343 we do remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement thats both fair and equitable providing that union leadership is reasonable and realistic in its approach
4407344 we have problems up front as we are missing key personnel we are a little bit light and went with two young guys who are still learning the game it was difficult for them
4407345 i think what the bid does show is that the club is in decent shape financially and that we were able to make a bid of that significance

4407349 shoppers are advised that the four day market spectacular will go ahead as planned and most shops in town will open
4407350 when we came out of the pub all we could see was smoke coming out of the roof and within a matter of minutes flames were coming out there was loads of people coming out of the hotel but it didnt look like anyone was seriously injured the fire brigade were already here when we came out but more and more engines kept coming
4407351 we couldnt believe what we were seeing the flames could been seen from miles away it looked like the whole town centre was on fire the smoke and flames seemed to fill the sky
4407352 there were loads of firefighters running around when i got here it seemed like it was going to take a lot of them to bring it under control at one point it looked like they had put it out but the flames just started shooting out of the roof again
4407353 i couldnt believe what i was seeing there was people everywhere just stood around watching what was going on a lot of the people who had come out of the hotel looked quite frightened many of them seemed to be from china or japan they didnt really know what was going on the police managed to move them to safety quite quickly

4407362 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4407363 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4407364 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4407365 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4407366 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4407367 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4407368 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4407369 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

4407442 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defense system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4407443 this is the highest ever that weve scored in the last 18 years for sure
4407444 i am concerned that our students have not exceeded or at least reached the average of the state
4407445 we need to do a good job of analyzing whether there are certain areas we need to focus on to better prepare them we encourage these young people to take these exams and oftentimes their skills like language are not as proficient as they need to be we have to be cognizant of that my objective is that we exceed the state average and if they are not there make sure we effectively help them get to those levels
4407446 we formed a mini task force of teachers last spring to address why historically our school has scored below the state average on the act
4407447 we are looking at any and every possible contributing factor schedule rigor college equivalent offerings strong focus on struggling learners and on and on it looks like it may be a two year process but we hope to determine ways we can raise the score up we feel strongly here that we do an outstanding job of developing all levels of students but we certainly at the very least need to ask the question
4407448 while a one year jump is not a clear indicator that the improvements weve made in curriculum assessment and instruction made a difference it is starting a trend in the right direction
4407449 high school principal scott thompson and his staff spent significant time working on curriculum assessment and instructional practices to address the deficits we saw one year ago in reading and english
4407450 it is a good predictor of academic success in college
4407451 its not quite as accurate as a high school grade point which takes into consideration perseverance work ethic and motivation

4407453 adecco believes that there is scope for a combination with michael page which is to the benefit of both companies and their respective shareholders
4407454 the board unanimously concluded that this revised proposal also materially undervalued the company and its prospects and that the proposed transaction structure was unattractive for shareholders
4407455 adecco places considerable value on the management and strong culture of michael page it is therefore important to adecco that it is able to retain the senior management of michael page in the event that an offer is completed
4407456 the only thing is that im not confident with how the game ended
4407457 i lost my second baseman when the pitcher pedro luis lazo threw the ball at his head i dont see any place for that in baseball i respect the way cuba plays baseball but i dont like losing players
4407458 it takes all the work out of baseball because all you need is a base hit and youve got a good shot to win
4407459 normally you get a guy on first and battle to get home it was strange running out to second from the dugout ive never done that in my life and probably never will again
4407460 there is no reason why fares should go up as a result of this for the consumer it means they will have access to a much bigger network we will coordinate our schedules to make it easier to connect between airlines and you will have greater access to cheaper fares
4407461 there will be nothing to stop the customer from taking a fare with aa outbound and taking a fare with ba on the inbound leg
4407462 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the uk and us aviation industry
4407463 this is an open market and that is the big difference between now and 2001 anybody can come in and compete
4407464 we have seen open skies and we have seen the effects
4407465 the other two alliances have anti trust immunity the issue of competition between the alliances is much more relevant than it was in 2001 and we have a changed industry environment things have changed sufficiently for us to apply with confidence this time
4407466 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4407467 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them

4407475 they that have the power to hurt and will do none they rightly do inherit heavens graces
4407476 true heroism is remarkably sober very undramatic it is not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost but the urge to serve others at whatever cost
4407477 if heaven is about to entrust an important mission to a man it begins by filling his heart with bitterness and by confusing his powers of perception and overturning his plans it forces him to exert his bone and muscle it forces him to endure hunger and all manner of sufferings when the man emerges triumphantly over all these trials and tribulations he is then capable of accomplishing what would have been impossible for him to do before

4407519 he looks like more of a strategist than a fighter
4407520 one reason why its so important for us to perceive our leaders as competent credible and sincere is because that makes us feel secure
4407521 we identify with leaders if leaders look confident brave bold and true then we feel we can take on the world
4407522 whats the job of a leader its to move us
4407523 if you dont look sincere then youre never going to move anybody
4407524 one reason why its so important for us to perceive our leaders as competent credible and sincere is because that makes us feel secure
4407525 we identify with leaders if leaders look confident brave bold and true then we feel we can take on the world
4407526 he said righhtt as much as i want to believe that im just not in the mood to have people pair me up with other people i want things to go naturally
4407527 i need to tell you something remember how i lost my pencil case and found it afterwards yeah well erm which happens to be a favourite of mine amp amp amp amp amp its a library book erm yeah
4407528 when you go from extreme high water to low water that has a tendency to leave behind significant sediment and it shifts channels unexpectedly
4407529 when you have a flood you get a combination of sediment and soil coming off the farm fields and golf courses and streets and yards
4407530 also the energy from the flow picks up sand off the bottom of the river it swirls it all together in this milky hazy mixture that comes down the river during flooding
4407531 wow i feel so good im gonna go out and get shit faced yay
4407532 the objective is to provide those companies with the necessary expertise so that they contribute to the enhancement of local enterprises
4407533 jerusalem will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
4407534 i swore to myself that if i ever faced such a crisis again i would come down on the side of dramatic action going down in flames if that was required
4407535 there will be situations that require the united states to work with its partners in africa to fight terrorism with lethal force having a unified command operating in africa will facilitate this action
4407536 will enhance our efforts to bring peace and security to the people of africa
4407537 the first african american ever to win nomination to vie for the presidency of the worlds sole super power
4407538 with this win their son will implement africa friendly policies that could uplift the continent from poverty
4407539 good and know that nothing is impossible no matter where you come from
4407540 likely to benefit if he wins the presidential election this august
4407541 he says he is likely to move away from the policies of sanctions which has hurt countries like zimbabwe to negotiation he says he will have tough aid conditions and will move away from the weapons of mass destruction to mass reconstruction
4407542 but what is there for africa in the american elections
4407543 overcome the strong lobby groups that control american foreign policy and that have very little time for africa
4407544 we cannot lay claims on obama hes not one of us
4407545 what everyone seems to be forgetting is that barack obama is an american not a kenyan his roots may lie in kenya but he was born and raised in the united states and his loyalty lies with that nation not with ours
4407546 as a us senator my country and other nations have an obligation and self interest in being full partners with kenya and africa and i will do my part to shape an intelligent foreign policy that promotes peace and prosperity
4407547 national racial and ethnic pride that a black man can become king of the empire
4407548 the nature of the us as a state and the character of the american presidency
4407549 the american presidency is a highly circumscribed office that is subject to larger national interests on which there is consensus about the purpose of government
4407550 develop and implement a foreign policy to enhance us interests and pursue a domestic policy that will bring economic prosperity to the nation
4407551 why am i pessimistic about the prospects of an obama presidency for africa
4407552 structurally racist and exploitative relationship with africa in slavery the brutal capture transportation sale and exploitation of africans to build america and the support by the united states of cold war despots in africa lies the destructive relationship between black people and america
4407553 that africa is so underdeveloped and marginalised in global politics that is why to america africa has either been an afterthought or an object of pity and charity it would require an ideological shift by the us to change its relationship with africa to base it on equality fair trade and investment and a voice for africans in global institutions
4407554 these are not steps that a president can take alone because they affect fundamental american interests and would call for a realignment of us foreign policy so that it is not simply eurocentric
4407555 that had never happened before i realized not in hawaii not in indonesia not in l a or new york or chicago for the first time in my life i felt the comfort the firmness of identity that a name might provide how it could carry an entire history in other peoples memories so that they might nod and say knowingly oh you are so and sos son no one here in kenya would ask how to spell my name or mangle it with an unfamiliar tongue my name belonged and so i belonged drawn into a web of relationships alliances and grudges that i did not yet understand
4407556 there are times when considering the plight of africa the millions racked by aids the constant droughts and famines the dictatorships the pervasive corruption the brutality of twelve year old guerillas who know nothing but war wielding machetes or ak 47s i find myself plunged into cynicism and despair
4407557 there are positive trends in africa often hidden in the news of despair while at the same time clinging to an afropessimism that warns
4407558 covert support to various insurgencies inside indonesia and cultivated close links with indonesias military officers many of whom had been trained in the united states
4407559 our record is mixed not just in indonesia but across the world
4407560 occasionally u s covert operations would engineer the removal of democratically elected leaders in countries like with seismic repercussions that haunt us to this day
4407561 in the curious position of defending aspects of reagans worldview
4407562 were single handedly responsible for poverty around the world nobody forced corrupt leaders in third world countries to steal from their people
4407563 as the child of a black man and a white woman someone who was born in the racial melting pot of hawaii with a sister whos half indonesian but whos usually mistaken for mexican or puerto rican and a brother in law and a niece of chinese descent with some blood relatives who resemble margaret thatcher and others who could pass for bernie mac so that family get togethers over christmas take on the appearance of a un general assembly meeting ive never had the option of restricting my loyalties on the basis of race or measuring my worth on the basis of tribe
4407564 the driver of the toyota suffered bruising and soreness to his chest and minor cuts to his hand
4407565 who better to bring a tumultuous region together than the worlds best and most respected baseball player me
4407566 my philosophy is to look at what israelis and palestinians have in common before focusing on their differences
4407567 sure it might be frustrating that peace could be impossible without the status of palestinian refugees rights of return being resolved first
4407568 but lets not forget that the israeli baseball league saw its first season begin in earnest last year and let us also not forget that we constantly see footage of palestinian boys throwing rocks as hard as they can at the israelis i dont see disgruntled arab youth i see future starting pitchers and that commonality can build bridges
4407569 i doubt that rodriguez could even find the jerusalem on a labeled map
4407570 presidents clinton and bush have both tried and failed to forge peace between these bitterly divided religious rivals
4407571 this isnt like trying to get the boston red sox and yankees to play nice in the american league east peoples lives are actually on the line and to have this peacock fan his feathers and pretend like he can do what no respected leader in america or europe could do is insulting as it is arrogant
4407572 i play in new york after all and critics hammer me the way i hammer meaningless one run homeruns in blowouts where we lose
4407573 chick peas sesame tahini lemon juice and garlic tend to give me indigestion but i wouldnt let hummus lack of involvement prevent the overall prospect of an independent palestinian state
4407574 my philosophy is to look at what israelis and palestinians have in common before focusing on their differences

4407581 many of us are concerned about the quality of care extended to those who receive elective surgery
4407582 serious risk of the countrys long term isolation in the international arena
4407583 this time around they us eu are a little more vocal in their criticism particularly as abdallahi was democratically elected and i think that brussels and the us went out on a limb supporting the coup leaders and their movement towards democratic reform only to have it overturned a year later
4407584 the position of the army has always been a problem in terms of consolidating the political order within the country
4407585 mauritania has experience in multiple coups and the one 2005 that led to the transition failed to reorganize the whole security sector to the extent that when you have a small political crisis the army emerges to restore so called order
4407586 the military may be interested in trying to cultivate a certain co opted political islam similar to what the monarchy has done in rabat morocco where the pjd justice and development party has sort of bought into the parliamentary system
4407587 i think that the root cause of the political crisis in mauritania is the hike in food prices that forced the government to dissolve the whole cabinet and appoint a new cabinet in may
4407588 the reaction of the government failed to take into account the realities of the country
4407589 no probably not mauritania doesnt have the capital markets tools to deal with inflation and it certainly doesnt have any answers in the short term to increase domestic food production
4407590 i dont think the us support to train to recruit or rearm or maybe to offer military assistance to countries has been effective in fighting terrorism in those countries
4407591 what it does do is to maybe give the military the idea that they remain a strong entity that can rewrite the political destiny of their country and that is very dangerous for all the countries involved in that us military cooperation
4407592 the french have also played a pretty significant role on the security front
4407593 the military was growing frustrated with abdallahi because of what they thought was his ineptitude in dealing with terrorism even though they were the ones ultimately shouldering the burden of terrorism
4407594 is al qaida in the islamic maghreb really pushing into mauritania
4407595 my sense is no they have encouraged individual actors in mauritania tunisia or morocco to claim affiliation with al qaida once they carry out successful attacks but if the attack fizzles then they are discouraged from saying it was a part of al qaida
4407596 youth radicalization is probably more likely to manifest itself in violence than in actual political action
4407597 there has been quite a lot of islamist related violence but this stuff strikes me as more opportunistic or copy cat than organized resistance to the secular government
4407598 the us has been the destination for most mauritanian oil so far and you also have the french involved to a certain extent
4407599 no the priority for the us and paris would be on maintaining state stability pushing the military council towards holding new elections but not undermining the states overall viability
4407600 this is the most publicised issue theyve had in their history and its really the sort of embarrassing bug that never should have made it past qa quality assurance
4407601 last night we became aware of a code issue with the recently released update to esx 3 5 and esxi 3 5 update 2
4407602 from what ive heard the patch fixes the problem you do have to give kudos to vmware for addressing the issue so quickly
4407603 as a vmware enterprise partner and vmware authorized consultant i can tell you this is a big deal for vmware to release a product that has such grave consequences for even a relatively small portion of the total vmware user population
4407604 a small percentage does not diminish the severity of problem for affected users and the upmost urgency is expected from a company that caters to enterprise customers who dont have downtime in their corporate dictionary anymore
4407605 however i believe this could have been prevented by not rushing an update to market which was intended to be free and compete with microsofts hyper v this will no doubt teach vmware a lesson and unfortunately will cast doubt about the reliability of vmware in the enterprise its a shame a clearly superior product is going to get bad publicity from this oversight lets give them credit and hope they learn from their mistakes
4407606 the issue was fixed quickly and there was lots of communication as to the status cause and future changes to prevent another incident
4407607 however some faith has been lost as most customers ive talked to are disappointed that a bug like this made it past qa many admins have been pushing virtualisation to their executives and this doesnt help their case
4407608 virtualisation is still in the emerging stages and enterprise reliability is a huge issue that can only be proven over time
4407609 vendors have been pushing the idea that it is enterprise ready and an incident like this hurts not only vmware but the entire virtualisation movement virtualisation is inevitable and will certainly continue to proceed but people will slow down and think more about how to protect themselves against things like this
4407610 more and more people are using it and a major incident whether a bug or a security hack could freeze your entire infrastructure i think people will begin to re evaluate their options and contingency plans for an incident like this including perhaps diversifying their infrastructure and adopting multiple hypervisors
4407611 als je tankt voor 50 euro dan krijg je 34 eurocent korting ja hallo wat is me dat voor een voordeel terwijl die uitbuiters tanken op ons belastingsgeld en kunnen reizen dat ze erbij neervallen feesten als de beesten campagnes voeren met het geld van de burger
4407612 at arms length from ministers to ensure the independence and objectivity of the testing regime
4407613 ets europe was selected due to the strength of their worldwide experience in delivering large scale assessments
4407614 it is disappointing that the issues with this years national curriculum test results have meant that the partnership between qca and ets europe must end early
4407615 ets europe has apologised to schools for the delays in marking national curriculum assessments in england
4407616 as a subsidiary of a global non profit company we are dedicated to assuring quality and equity for all pupils and we are sorry that the results this summer were delayed for some schools
4407617 however we would argue that the quality of the marking is high due to the stringent new checks that we introduced this year
4407618 terrorism in all of its manifestation is a terrible thing
4407619 but what we witness in kashmir is terrorism of the most pernicious kind the state terrorism
4407620 i think if it were all over today hed be the greatest olympian who ever lived
4407621 i just wanted to step on it in the first 50 meters a little bit and try and get out to an early lead i knew in the first half if i got a big enough lead i thought i could hang on and thats all i wanted to do

4407624 ryan had an incredible swim today and im glad to see him get his first gold i know hes happy
4407625 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4407626 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4407627 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4407628 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4407629 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4407630 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4407631 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4407632 sedan jag uts gs till vd har jag identifierat flera problem i verksamheten och med tekniken som hindrat oss fr n att lyckas

4407634 tobacco seriously damages your health and that of persons close to you
4407635 the country spends five times the revenue it gets from growing tobacco treating patients of the malaise making it totally impossible to make a case of any advantage we are getting from the whole industry
4407636 annually the public health system treats some 12 000 patients from tobacco illnesses out of which 4 000 are non smokers thus the need to tighten rules to protect no smokers
4407637 what farmers in these areas should be encouraged to do is grow more food than tobacco to help kenya attain self sufficiency in food production it is sad that the nearly arid lands are put under crops that dont help food security for the family
4407638 the soils take years to recover and support other crops thus accelerating food insecurity which translates in high poverty levels
4407639 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
4407640 on the campaign trail john mccain claims that he fought to expose jack abramoff and his corrupt cronies
4407641 it was a scandal that rocked the country linking all the way to the bush white house and republicans in congress sending two former republican congressmen to prison
4407642 but now desperate to raise campaign cash to run more negative attack ads john mccain is cozying up to jack abramoffs cronies
4407643 ralph reed a key business partner of jack abramoff helped the convicted former republican lobbyist launder 2 million dollars through a front group to finance a gambling campaign
4407644 now ralph reed has signed up to raise money for john mccain
4407645 ralph reeds murky connections to jack abramoff run so deep it cost him a race for lt
4407646 while most people now see ralph reed as a tainted man raising tainted money john mccain sees him as a source of campaign cash

4407658 there are ways to prove it through testing but not in a scientifically and legally accurate way there can be a plus or minus by one or two years and the results can be manipulated by taking certain substances
4407659 this question is being tackled by several federations not just gymnastics if there is an age limit in an event there is a risk

4407663 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4407665 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4407666 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4407667 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4407674 the idea that people should abandon the north and move to the already crowded south east where house prices and living costs are sky high is an insult to people living here
4407675 i am staggered that a think tank so close to the conservatives is making such a call
4407676 it looks like the conservatives are starting to show their true colours so the battle at the next election in bury south will be between the liberal democrats with a record of standing up for local people the conservatives who want you to move to berkshire and a discredited labour government

4407715 el museo de manchester se plantea hace mucho la cuesti n tica en el tema de la exhibici n de restos humanos todo empez a os atr s cuando grupos ind genas de australia nueva zelanda y am rica del norte solicitaron la repatriaci n de restos exhibidos por nosotros
4407716 cuando nos planteamos redise ar las salas dedicadas al antiguo egipto que no hab an sufrido ning n cambio en m s de 20 a os decidimos iniciar un di logo con los visitantes sobre cu l es la mejor manera de exhibir las momias
4407717 yo creo que hay que regresar las momias a sus tumbas como una muestra de respeto respeto al ser humano m s all de cualquier culto creencia o religi n respeto por personas que pidieron descansar en paz
4407718 seqenen ra ta ii llamado el m rtir es un h roe para los antiguos egipcios no es necesario mostrar su agon a al momento de morir el dolor en sus brazos en sus manos por qu estamos mostrando un hombre tan importante para nosotros de esa forma
4407719 nosotros nos hemos planteado c mo exhibir las momias de una forma correcta respetuosa protegi ndolas del deterioro pero nunca hemos pensado en dejar de exhibirlas
4407720 son personas muertas que deben ser enterradas o s mbolos de la antigua cultura egipcia nosotros pensamos que son parte de nuestra herencia no cad veres que representan la fant stica habilidad de los antiguos egipcios para preservar a estos seres queridos
4407721 para m las momias son personas muertas no son monumentos no son piedras no son estatuas no son pilares son seres humanos carne hueso sangre
4407722 existen adem s decenas de textos que nosotros llamamos maldiciones donde se amenaza a quien interrumpa el sue o de los faraones aquellos que me despierten de mis descanso eterno enfrentar n el fuego o la muerte vendr con alas r pidas contra aquellos que entren a mi tumba tomen mis cosas o manipulen mi cuerpo y hay muchos m s
4407723 la mayor a de las momias exhibidas tanto en el museo egipcio como en todo el mundo fueron movidas mucho tiempo atr s de sus tumbas originales en el pasado egipto sufri varias invasiones y los antiguos egipcios movieron las momias a ubicaciones secretas para protegerlas as que nosotros no las hemos sacado de su lugar de origen
4407724 yo no estoy de acuerdo con la excusa del estudio cient fico y le pongo como ejemplo la momia de tutmosis i desde que fue colocado en su caja de vidrio en el museo egipcio d cadas atr s tiene un signo de pregunta al lado de su nombre entonces por m s que lo han sacado de su tumba nunca hemos estado seguros de que se trate de tutmosis i
4407725 desde la perspectiva isl mica yo me tom el trabajo de preguntarle a alguna de nuestras eminencias religiosas si es correcto exponer gente muerta de esa manera y estas figuras me dijeron que desde el punto de vista isl mico no es correcto m s all de la creencia de esa persona
4407726 si uno le pregunta a cualquiera que nos muestre a su abuelo de esa forma por 100 libras egipcias alguien estar a de acuerdo yo lo dudo
4407727 desde una perspectiva isl mica o desde un enfoque basado en las creencias del antiguo egipto
4407728 si tenemos una serie de momias vinculadas a un per odo hist rico determinado mantenidas en buena condici n lo que estamos haciendo es mostrar uno de lo grandes misterios del pasado

4407770 its a cause for regret that at a time when we are already in a difficult situation the american side further exacerbates the situation in relations between the united states and russia
4407771 they are here in full force and doing lots of damage its going to be a pretty ugly friday and monday
4407772 the root causes are many but beyond the macro economic triggers the immediate reason for the slide is the dollar
4407773 whether that is a final peak or an intermediate peak followed by higher prices we dont know yet it could go lower
4407774 its a big shakeout in gold and silver for people who have been long but dont really believe in the commodities
4407775 if you do it speculatively with leverage i dont recommend buying it now
4407776 i expect commodity prices to remain subdued until mid 2009
4407777 the major issue in commodities is the proliferation of etfs and hedge funds as they unwind positions this leads to the price overshooting
4407778 dollar driven probably because we are supposedly seeing more write downs in the european banks
4407779 we could see gold go all the way down to 750 an ounce
4407780 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defense system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4407781 i consider that the united states is not acting in a cautious manner in this situation
4407782 instead of getting full moral and political support in the struggle against real aggression and ethnic cleansing we have heard a mass of unpleasant words and threats that will of course not strengthen our relations

4407806 this study is important because it brings attention to certain vulnerable groups who are currently underserved specifically ex combatants who make up 30 percent of 3 2 million people
4407807 we hope these findings will be used to help the liberian ministry of health in writing their mental health policy
4407808 we used a speech stressor test used in a lot of psychology research
4407809 basically the participants each appeared before a panel of several evaluators who supposedly were behavioral experts participants had to give a 10 minute speech which was videotaped and then are asked a series of math questions they had to solve without paper or pen
4407810 the whole exercise is a nice stress experiment in the laboratory
4407811 the wheals on a person who was moderately anxious because of the experiment were 75 percent larger after the experiment compared to that same persons response on the day when they were not stressed
4407812 but people who were highly anxious had wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed moreover these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress
4407813 late phase reactions also occur in allergic asthma and can in the proper settings be potentially life threatening
4407814 the results of this study should alert practitioners and patients alike to the adverse effects of stress on allergic reactions in the nose chest skin and other organs that may seemingly resolve within a few minutes to hours after starting but may reappear the nest day when least expected
4407815 whats interesting about this is that it shows that being stressed can cause a persons allergies to worsen the next day
4407816 this is clinically important for patients since most of what we do to treat allergies is to take antihistimines to control the symptoms runny nose watery itchy eyes and congestion
4407817 furthermore the event will recognise the tremendous steps which have been made by individuals and by the community as a whole in rebuilding lives in our town and a key element of the ceremony will be a communal dedication to peace

4407826 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases

4407830 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away

4407832 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away

4407974 the vultures have never circled over me before but ill deal with it
4407975 i understand the criticism i dont close my eyes to it but i dont have to accept all of it as well

4407977 i accept that there is a responsibility i know there are certain traditions at west ham and ive been brought up on that
4407978 people have to understand that we were patched up a lot of times last season and quite often the team picked itself given the injuries we had but i accept the criticism
4407979 following an inspection with course inspector peter hobbs the decision has been taken to abandon tuesdays meeting
4407980 you know it was one of those rounds i just kind of when i had to hole 8 6 10 footer for par i did
4407981 i holed first about a 8 footer or 10 footer for par that was a funny sense kind of a good start a momentum builder then holed a nice put on 2
4407982 after that i played real solid didnt really look like making bogey the rest of the day maybe on 16 the par 3 i had to hole about a 6 footer it was a real good round hit it good and as i said putted well
4407983 definitely its something im thinking about actually started the week before reno i was rooming with chez reavie in toronto when he won

4407989 the governors office was given a general heads up a couple days before the raid the meeting was already set
4407990 evidently there was some discussion about what to do about the meeting in case they didnt know the precise time but they knew these two events could happen very close there was some discussion should they keep the meeting at same time postpone it
4407991 why law enforcement couldnt let us know during the meeting
4407992 and i received a call at about 8 30 p m but we realized at that point there wasnt much that could be done
4407993 the people that i have talked to are all hopeful we can resolve the concerns over the timing of the sweep being coincidental with the meeting of the panel
4407994 heard rumors that there were some members of the panel who might resign over the timing of the sweep and our meeting my feeling is that this panel is our best venue for getting good and helpful and productive conversation around the immigration issue so my strong hope is that that we can figure out a way to resolve this problem
4407995 i want to stay at the table until im absolutely convinced we cant get any good out of this
4407996 that the most effective thing would be to resign i said at this point id like to think the panel can do something thats useful

4408027 more homeowners are paying tribute to wine in their outdoor rooms because of what it represents to them
4408028 when people open a bottle of wine theyre not just sharing a drink theyre sharing an experience theyre enjoying good company good conversation and romance theyre making memories
4408029 recycling is a major component of our environmental philosophy and were always looking for new ways to use old materials
4408030 those bottles represent good times with friends why throw them away when they make a perfect building material

4408039 the crazy ones the misfits the rebels the troublemakers the round pegs in the square holes the ones who see things differently
4408040 im sick and tired of this notion that there is a singular big idea out there marketers demand it from their agencies and agencies in turn expect it from media sellers and technology vendors and they all want it yesterday plus no one wants to pay for it big ideas take too much time to find and we dont have the time to find em big ideas are equated to expensive ideas hence the word big theyre meant to create a splash secure buzz enrapture the masses with pomp grandeur and ceremony
4408041 ideas are about potential as victor hugo once said there is nothing as powerful as an idea whose time has come but the idea is a catalyst a conduit a means to an end and not an end unto itself today the only time big ideas are means to an end is when that end is winning a new business pitch or a grand prix at cannes most new business pitch big ideas are unimplementable and how many grand prix winners at cannes have gone on to change the world or transform businesses business models and or lives you wont hear me talking about the big idea anymore but rather many small ideas its time to get out of the business of desperately seeking the hail mary or grand slam and focus on small ball or winning through a series of calculated gains of inch increments its time to truly recognize the power of small being the new big as seth godin might say which more often than not begins with one human one individual one life one smile one spark one seed and grows and takes off from there

4408066 a lot of younger employees want to take their parents to the workplace to show them around it becomes almost a given or they would participate in a family day younger people are staying in touch with their parent even at work often several times a day
4408067 weve heard of a couple instances of parents calling up when they were unhappy with performance reviews people are talking to their parents five times a day they ask a lot of questions now in the workplace it drives their bosses crazy if they expect an immediate response from a manager they might not get it
4408068 she was going to knock it out of the park
4408069 one of the things is to manage expectations an employer needs to be parental coaching in dealing with conflict and criticism to remind a young person they are an adult part of it is defining who you are how to live independently explaining that this is your job and your life and you will be held accountable
4408070 youre not only recruiting the child youre recruiting the parent understand that every step of the negotiation process even though their parents are not present employees are going back to their parents at home theyre going to be involved in every step of the process a lot of employees will come in with expectations fueled by parents sometimes they give up easily they do want to see things happen quickly when that doesnt happen they often get frustrated and move on so companies need to adapt
4408071 part of it is that the boomers worked so hard with mother and father in the workplace theyre trying to make up for time spent working and they have very high standards for their offspring its very much a culture where they want to participate in what their kids do
4408072 interestingly i hear from teachers elementary or middle school that the gen y parents are even worse this whole hovering phenomenon is becoming part of how society operates its very child centered gen y are the generation thats had more attention than any in history when we talk about helicopter parents its a small percentage its just that its a big change in the workplace
4408073 its important to note that helicopter parenting is pretty specific to certain socioeconomic populations not all parents of millennials have the time or resources to hover over their kids all the time its more prevalent among affluent parents who have really pushed their kids to succeed all their lives who did all the scheduling of sports practices and music lessons and helped them apply for college and never manage to lower their level of involvement even after they move out of the house
4408074 in some ways theres an opportunity there are plenty of gen yrs who are professional and mature and they are really sticking out now theres now a meaningful way to distinguish themselves
4408075 most of the rain is going to fall over more or less a 12 to 15 hour period and a lot of areas could see upwards of 50 millimetres or so by the time its all done
4408076 so thats quite a bit to fall in that period of time
4408077 although these findings seem surprising at first they hint at fears parents have about video games
4408078 to some parents video games are full of unknowable dangers while researching for grand theft childhood parents we spoke with in focus groups often bemoaned the fact that they didnt know how to use game controls and felt unequipped to supervise or limit video game play of course parents dont want their children drinking alcohol but thats a more familiar risk

4408096 we still feel confident about our chances we know our rivals will be strong but weve worked hard to improve the car and are confident well be competitive this weekend
4408097 looking back at the season so far it feels like a different championship compared to last year 2007 was very intense and consistency was incredibly important
4408098 this year everybodys results have been more varied and every driver who has won a race has also failed to score on at least two other occasions
4408099 thats made getting strong results even more important but i think well see consistency becoming crucial as we head towards the end of the season
4408100 the most important thing is to finish consistently in the points
4408101 this summer break gave me the opportunity to get away from that and focus on just recharging my batteries
4408102 going to a new circuit doesnt really change my preparations everybodys in the same situation so i dont treat things very differently
4408103 of course weve done some preparation back at the mclaren technology centre ahead of this race but our main focus will still be the three free practice sessions ahead of qualifying
4408104 ill be working closely with my engineers to make sure we start the weekend with a good baseline and work hard to strengthen it as we go through the weekend

4408147 it should be a celebration a really good time for the essendon football club because of the warriors theyve been
4408148 it was harder the first time i was 29 at that point
4408149 now im just battling each week to play the rigours of football of today
4408150 i came to the realisation that the way footballs evolved it just doesnt suit my frame and my body size any more it really is a young running mans game
4408151 what again everyones got to retire eventually its only how many dame nellie melbas you have
4408152 mal was a terrific player for us he was a part of a lot of success we had so he retired and came again for essendon as we all know
4408153 in 2002 i returned to new guinea after many years and i saw the troubles that the country had so id like to help in some ways
4408154 were planning to win our final three games and see what occurs from that first and foremost adelaide starting saturday
4408155 we were a touch disappointed the way we played our first half last week it wasnt the way wed been playing the previous eight weeks so were fully wound up for tomorrows game
4408156 well look to play aggressive football for the next three weeks and continue not only to possibly send off champions of the club but also continue to give young players opportunity at senior level
4408157 should employees be allowed to store guns in their cars while parked on company property even if the employer objects
4408158 were only three weeks away from one of the biggest one day tournaments that we play and we still dont know if were going
4408159 weve heard what they had to say were a lot more informed now than we were before the day started and theres obviously some decisions to be made in the next few days
4408160 the concerns are still there of course there have been lots of things said that are going to be put into place and lets hope those things are put in place to an appropriate level
4408161 were only three weeks away from one of the biggest one day tournaments that we play and we still dont know if were going
4408162 if were going to relocate now it needs to be made within the next few days operationally it would be difficult but its certainly not an option that would be discarded at this point and it could be relocated
4408163 they cricket australia need to give us a firm indication
4408164 all theyve done today is listen to the facts obviously weve heard that there are still some concerns particularly from the players association mainly to do with the confidence in the actual implementation of the security measures which are in place
4408165 its 24 days now till the tournament starts so its coming down to crunch time
4408166 what weve always said is that we reserve our rights to make a decision at the appropriate time even if we decide that were going we still reserve our rights to change our mind at any stage
4408167 taking on board the advice weve received today but also our ongoing assessments from various other sources weve got some thinking to do in the next little while things will obviously develop in the coming couple of weeks
4408168 i havent got a decision to make until cricket australia make a decision
4408169 its a hypothetical question i think the players that youve probably heard from before might not go but well wait and see what happens in the next few days

4408175 this is a fairly remarkable streak when the guys are all playing well like this you have this feeling that you can always come back
4408176 nothing is set in stone other than hes the starter in the first ball game
4408177 i know what i can and cant do and i know i can throw the ball with anybody out there
4408178 im not worried about that what people say about me thats fine they have their opinions i know the people that really know football know i can throw the ball
4408179 i thought i dont know if he can do it im not sure he can
4408180 he really showed what he can do as a passer
4408181 gave me every opportunity to start i think i did well but its his decision
4408182 i understand his decision and im happy with it i think im ready to lead the team if im called upon
4408183 theres always that feeling when somebodys got a little magic
4408184 whenever youre around brett its kind of in the air that hes got magic we havent been with him through a game yet but steve has that air about him too
4408185 were not going to win if we dont play defense the way we did tonight
4408186 the longer and longer this negotiation went on the more i could see myself coming back
4408187 i was pretty much ready to go ive matured a lot more since high school and im glad that my decision out of high school was to go to texas
4408188 i didnt really have a specific number of what my price was i just told the white sox that i have no problem with going back to texas i guess thats why this took so long
4408189 we dont really worry about the streak it just falls as it should
4408190 its better to just not worry about it and be relaxed and just play
4408191 we tell our kids and preach to them that climbing the mountain of success is easy but staying up there is tough
4408192 thinking about every week youve got to stay up youve got to worry about injuries youve got to worry about a kids girlfriend all the other variables that come into play youve got total respect for that because on any friday night youve got a 50 50 chance that youll win or lose
4408193 i said to him for todays competition just let it go
4408194 i felt a little sluggish the first round but my body is woke up now
4408195 i think there were more collisions in that one race than they had all the rest of the night
4408196 a musician a successful musician artistically successful whatever that means
4408197 a hot rod 1937 ford coupe with a flathead is right near the top of the list
4408198 ideally it would be period correct to what a 37 would have been modified to in the early 50s
4408199 maybe the law of averages if i play him enough hes bound to have an off day against me
4408200 i cant be more elated that it happened at the olympics
4408201 i think it should be successful i did everything he asked me to do
4408202 i didnt do them to influence the commissioner i did them to better myself as a person
4408203 they were normally things that i have been doing besides staying out of trouble
4408204 commissioner goodell told jones that his continued participation in the nfl depends on demonstrating that he can conduct himself in a lawful and reliable manner
4408205 jones will be expected to continue the personal conduct program established by the nfl and the cowboys and to avoid further adverse involvement with law enforcement
4408206 we hear a lot about how the linebackers dont do this they dont do that but we know what weve got and we know how hard weve been working
4408207 i think people are going to be surprised at how much better we will be this year im telling you theres a lot of talent at linebacker
4408208 they are bracketed at the middle linebacker spot and are co starters in my eyes
4408209 they are both going to play they are both guys we can win with
4408210 were important i suppose because the secondary is kind of young
4408211 but thats just an excuse everybodys saying the secondary is young we just want to control the line of scrimmage play hard make sure everybody is on the same page because were pretty much the quarterbacks of the defense making sure everybody is doing what theyre supposed to be doing lined up right and everything
4408212 hes got initial quickness hes got good ball get off
4408213 hes a very strong upper body guy so he can power the tackles and hes got god given pass rush ability so youve got to utilize his talents and put him in a situation where he can be successful
4408214 if we mess up were going to play the next play but were going to play it fast and physical no half stepping were just going to try to come out from the start to finish thats what were going to show the fans that were real physical and tough
4408215 the 200 back is all legs in long course for ryan to come back 20 minutes later and just having us miss going one two its a pretty incredible swim and its an incredible day for him
4408216 ryan swam a wonderful race i swam the best race i could possibly swim it hurt but im proud that i hung in there like i did apparently it takes a world record just to win an event here
4408217 watching her on the medal stand she didnt even look that happy i think she was in shock
4408218 its my last race so im going to let it all go
4408219 he hansen is going to step it up and do something incredibly fast remember last time in 2004 he lost to japans kosuke kitajima in the 100 and then he beat him by about a half second in the relay so hes good
4408220 but we dont just go for size we go for athleticism and size we have three pro bowlers in the offensive line
4408221 they won super bowls with it they are good at what they do they come at you from all angles it presents an interesting challenge for us
4408222 hes a big aggressive receiver who likes to go get the ball owens said
4408223 i felt 38 today im not going to lie to you
4408224 dac arbitrii ne fur cu steaua scot echipa de pe teren
4408225 once we step out on the field with texas the only ones who can help us is ourselves texas always has a very polished team that has great talent but they arent tough they arent a physically tough team
4408226 my defense will get to a point where they will be mean nasty and ornery bastards and thats what you need for texas texas will move the ball with tit for tat screens and options but well make them pay a price whenever they catch one of those dinky passes well put three hats on them and make them not want to get up thats the way to beat texas
4408227 the first thing i thought of was my parents and my coach
4408228 its tough but we just got our own american record by four seconds so we cant complain about it
4408229 the huge mistake i made four years ago by taking the preliminaries too lightly has been eating at me for a long time and for me to go out there and accomplish that medal im really excited obviously it doesnt top the 400 freestyle relay from the other night but its something that has really pushed me for four years
4408230 im feeling a little tired right now and i got a couple days of rest
4408231 hes got a great stroke hes got great power in his stroke to be able to do a 50 all the way to a 200 and he has some of the best endurance in the world
4408232 it felt really good it felt a lot like yesterday morning i just wasnt as fast on the third 50 i could tell thats where they moved up
4408233 its such an honor to be surrounded by such incredible people all the time and to be able to compete for my country is really one of the best feelings in the world
4408234 i had been throwing up all morning and didnt have much energy
4408235 now its an international professional meet and its going to be tough mentally and physically and ive got to fight nobody is going to want to give an inch
4408236 its good to get a game like this under our belts
4408237 its good to have your backs against the wall every now and then it shows how we keep fighting were not just going to let down because another team is competing with us
4408238 you can throw her outside and she can beat you you can throw it inside and she can beat you you can throw it in the dirt and she can golf it you can throw it 10 feet over her head and she can tomahawk it
4408239 we all kind of laugh because she can do almost anything that she wants
4408240 the whole lineup changes the whole mentality just goes in the trash
4408241 i think maybe the referee rushed the decision to show michael the red card
4408242 i cant turn back i just got to keep going forward
4408243 it was difficult with the way they attacked us so hard wynne said
4408244 down a man and defending the whole time it was hard to get anything going offensively
4408245 i block that out of my mind i dont worry about that
4408246 hes just an incredible athlete and i wish him the best
4408247 we actually hung out a little bit this offseason at some different events were fine we talk like normal people we dont worry about the comparisons
4408248 there were a lot of things left on the field that could have been better williams said
4408249 hes going to do big things in this league for a long time bush said of williams
4408250 get over it man you were a pow fine you saw dresden firebombed and by some accounts more people killed than in hiroshima but youre supposed to be entertaining me now let it go and give me something else for my six dollars
4408251 i always say i dont mind being joe armstrong anyway
4408252 the audience is every four years for the olympics or when lance armstrong was winning the tours thats american cycling so i hope that winning a gold medal will bring the fans out for more than just one day every four years
4408253 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4408254 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4408255 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4408256 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4408257 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4408258 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4408259 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4408260 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4408261 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4408262 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4408263 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4408264 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4408265 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4408266 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4408267 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4408268 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4408269 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4408270 who are open to doing something on the production side
4408271 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4408272 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4408273 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4408274 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4408275 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4408276 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4408277 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4408278 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4408279 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4408280 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4408281 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4408282 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4408283 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4408284 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4408285 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4408286 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4408287 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4408288 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4408289 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4408290 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4408291 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4408292 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4408293 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4408294 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4408295 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4408296 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4408297 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4408298 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4408299 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4408300 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4408301 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4408302 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4408303 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

4408305 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4408306 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4408307 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4408308 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4408309 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4408310 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4408311 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4408312 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4408313 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4408314 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4408315 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4408316 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4408317 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4408318 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4408319 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4408320 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4408321 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4408322 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4408323 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4408324 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4408325 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4408326 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4408327 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4408328 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4408329 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4408330 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4408331 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4408332 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4408333 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4408334 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4408335 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4408336 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4408337 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

4408340 worries about an economic slowdown in the u s and europe and even japan are weighing on the oil market
4408341 with the dollar gaining strength against the euro and yen oil and other commodities have come down
4408342 oil is not so much a hedge against a falling dollar anymore
4408343 this pipeline problem has simply been ignored by the market
4408344 i think us 112 is still a key support level for oil
4408345 we are playing with peoples livelihoods if retailers are going to pay for these promotions out of their own money all well and good but we know from experience they will come looking for farmers to help redress the balance our costs are going up and confidence is fragile the price cutting could force more farmers to go under
4408346 were investing in price cuts where they count on everyday essentials
4408347 rising costs are hitting customers hard and they are looking to us to help
4408348 we are playing with peoples livelihoods if retailers are going to pay for these promotions out of their own money all well and good but we know from experience they will come looking for farmers to help redress the balance our costs are going up and confidence is fragile the price cutting could force more farmers to go under
4408349 were investing in price cuts where they count on everyday essentials
4408350 rising costs are hitting customers hard and they are looking to us to help
4408351 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4408352 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4408353 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4408354 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4408355 those directly affected by flooding in cedar rapids live and work in areas that are substantially poorer than most of their community and the state
4408356 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4408357 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4408358 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4408359 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4408360 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4408361 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4408362 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
4408363 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
4408364 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
4408365 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4408366 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4408367 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4408368 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4408369 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4408370 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4408371 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4408372 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4408373 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4408374 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4408375 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4408376 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4408377 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4408378 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4408379 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4408380 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4408381 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4408382 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4408383 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4408384 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4408385 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
4408386 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
4408387 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4408388 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
4408389 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
4408390 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
4408391 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
4408392 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
4408393 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
4408394 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
4408395 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4408396 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
4408397 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4408398 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4408399 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4408400 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4408401 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4408402 you should check email as often as you need to get the work of your day done
4408403 if one checks email all the time and is constantly answering or deleting mail will they ever get anything done
4408404 maybe thats the case for some but im convinced that in order for each of us individually and organizationally to thrive we need to respond better and faster all the time
4408405 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4408406 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4408407 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4408408 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4408409 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4408410 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4408411 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4408412 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4408413 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4408414 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4408415 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4408416 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4408417 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
4408418 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
4408419 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
4408420 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
4408421 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
4408422 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
4408423 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
4408424 it is my purpose to try to educate the people of new hampshire about this
4408425 its important to talk here about just how public funding works and why it is so important
4408426 i think granny d proves that one person can make a difference
4408427 this plan would allow candidates to deal with issues and not with money
4408428 the public has settled in their views about the war
4408429 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4408430 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4408431 the best thing you can do is weatherize your home
4408432 it not only lowers your heating bill a weatherization will reduce by 20 percent your fuel consumption it also saves you money and keeps money in the maine economy
4408433 this is a crisis and theres no shame in reaching out
4408434 volunteers can only volunteer when they know who theyre looking to help
4408435 weve only had one so 185 square feet per student thats fairly large
4408436 were looking at programs were looking at where we can make cuts and still meet needs of teachers
4408437 were trying to be responsible its a balancing act we need to be careful we dont want to be the district that builds a school then has to put on an addition in five years
4408438 so if we think it makes sense and if the extra space is justified it might be approved an emphasis on might
4408439 my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples
4408440 have mercy on me lord son of david my daughter is tormented by a demon
4408441 it is not fair to take the childrens food and throw it to the dogs
4408442 oh yes lord but even the dogs can eat the crumbs that fall from the masters table
4408443 woman great is your faith let it be done for you as you wish
4408444 i will make them joyful in my house of prayer
4408445 i heard there could be grants out there but i dont know yet if its going to be feasible for a property of that size
4408446 this is probably something that is going to go before the voters at the 2009 town meeting
4408447 this is a major concern to me because there seems to be consistent practice where the railroad has disposed of waste along the entire railroad line
4408448 i am requesting other expert opinion and documentation for the hearing
4408449 we have obtained a hydrologist a surveyor conducting supportive documentation for the area but i would like the town to assist us in pursuing this enforcement action
4408450 to date there are approximately 15 locations that i have given to the state they have only looked at three even though its been up to four years
4408451 providing additional documentation from an outside source would facilitate these proceedings and hopefully encourage additional review by the state
4408452 i assume its deputy fire chief benotti but i dont know
4408453 he was a young kid and they just wanted it to be over at the court they felt he was apologetic on that he was to go to jail but not for killing someone i dont know how you live with something like that
4408454 something tragic happens and there are people who take advantage of it and dont do their jobs they are responsible for taking care of those who didnt do anything wrong that sentence was a slap in the face david was a great person and its really sad theres no accountability no responsibility today the whole situation is unfortunate for what he took away i dont think 21 days is appropriate its a tragedy
4408455 we have to look at the defendant and his background and the facts of the case we consult with family members and make what we feel is an appropriate sentence the purpose of a sentence is rehabilitation punishment and deterrence
4408456 when we bring the flag down its called striking the colors now you can say youve learned something
4408457 the event is getting bigger and bigger and more well known every year
4408458 people also come from further afoot every year i think this year there will be very large attendance because of the price of fuel
4408459 its a big celebration for the seacoast and for new hampshire
4408460 its one piece of the jigsaw puzzle that makes up a great community and great region
4408461 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4408462 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4408463 i am very happy with what vijay said about his drivers
4408464 i am neither geek nor nerd i am not a hacker a phreaker a programmer or any variety of technoid dweeb
4408465 we are still showing a need for the 10th position
4408466 if i cant have the 11th officer and i can sustain the 10th then i need to change the 10th officers shift
4408467 looking at the officers shifts to justify the 10th position has caused me to believe there is backup needed between two and six in the morning
4408468 i was there alone on the scene until exeter got there
4408469 were down one officer right now having one more guy or girl out at that 10 p m to 6 a m shift is critical
4408470 according to their calculations 11 2 officers are needed for stratham
4408471 since we have had the 10th officer and that day shift has been filled residents have come forward and said theyve seen him in the area and are happy about it
4408472 id like to still maintain that but if i have to choose between officers safety and have people see them out there during the day im going to go with officer safety
4408473 go big and keep my board under me and stomp a landing
4408474 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4408475 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4408476 prohibition from child care services of persons convicted of certain offenses
4408477 seeks to change the social climate for gay lesbian bisexual transgender queer and questioning youth in the n h seacoast region
4408478 someone will come into my office and ill say did something happen on the bus today and theyll say no then ill say do i have to get the video and suddenly their story changes
4408479 we had several lunch accounts that were way way over for a year or two and we didnt have any way to deal with it
4408480 in our continuing efforts to ensure our communication with the community
4408481 weve been working to make sure that online content is timely
4408482 my biggest objection is the disruption of the site when they get through that site is going to resemble the genetically modified tomato there will be no resemblance of what is there now
4408483 if one building could be put on it i think it could be worked out but i think it is too intense of a use
4408484 half of the parking requires some kind of relief many of the drainage facilities are also in buffers or the shoreland protection district
4408485 theres quite a bit of relief that is required and thats not an opinion its a fact
4408486 wetland fill permits are meant to allow access to buildable land not create buildable land
4408487 flows for a sufficient time to develop and maintain a channel that might not flow during dry portions of the year
4408488 it seems to be one of the largest factors looming over the decision making process whether this is a stream or a ditch
4408489 but that doesnt mean in the future nothing will happen
4408490 i dont care how much or how little money i make this is what i want to do
4408491 my mother always told me i would make people laugh and hopefully this will get really big
4408492 i said something today i never thought id say before
4408493 i pulled into a gas station today and the guy said fill er up and i said no just 50
4408494 theyre not bitter theyre not jaded and theyre always ready to laugh
4408495 he maintained that seven was an even number because you cant spell seven without even
4408496 thirty years ago you know what they called the drunkest person at the party the life of the party
4408497 helping to provide educational opportunities is definitely one of them
4408498 thanks to the tremendous generosity of our board members supporters and the musicians who participate in this annual fund raiser
4408499 we have been able to increase the number of four year scholarships every year and our goal is to add 20 more students to the program this year
4408500 getting the data out of the device and into the control system usually uses proprietary software that is not interoperable across platforms
4408501 suponho que eles pensaram que os mi dos eram muito naturais e simp ticos
4408502 cinquenta e seis crian as de 56 grupos tnicos chineses juntaram se em torno da bandeira nacional chinesa representando os 56 grupos tnicos
4408503 is more careful with their things and has regular maintenance done more often
4408504 you badgered me to death to join your guild and all i want is to be alone
4408505 i couldnt risk getting caught again theyll try to take my work from me and claim it as their own
4408506 just a few more nights of digging king just a few more
4408507 just a few more nights of your instructions had it not been for that snooping little town tramp id be done with the dirty work im sorry for that but were still on schedule were still ahead of the curve
4408508 it can be compared to someone stealing the traffic lights on a busy main street
4408509 we were looking for ways to promote the idea that during construction newmarket is still open for business the economy is certainly struggling and given people are detouring through town its potentially harmful to a lot of the small businesses the big take home message is to encourage people to shop in newmarket
4408510 summers are usually a lot busier because of ice cream sales but it is nice to see actual progress with construction like sidewalks and curbs instead of a large hole
4408511 besides the economy people remember the traffic patterns from last year and i think people have the concept they cant come down here when they can the construction workers are really trying their best
4408512 i havent seen my kids in 14 years its been awful
4408513 its to put some checks and balances into the court system
4408514 its very very easy for one parent to alienate another parent using the children
4408515 im fighting now for all the other people that are stuck in the system
4408516 theres nothing i can do for myself for my situation im fighting to change the system so that so many people who are currently caught in the system wont have to suffer like some many hundreds of thousands of others have
4408517 people are so financially destroyed theyve mortgaged their houses theyve emptied their 401ks
4408518 its extremely driven by money we need to start holding the judges accountable for their actions they have totally unlimited power they do whatever they want
4408519 and to prove yourself innocent takes a whole lot of money theres zero due process
4408520 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4408521 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4408522 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4408523 our long term goal is that once weve vacated our space the library can more into it
4408524 thats something well be asking the voters to fund next year
4408525 hopefully well have some nice sun and some nice music
4408526 bring a blanket and a picnic lunch or dinner and enjoy the day
4408527 the teachers are back and i do think that its a testament to them being refreshed and ready for a new year
4408528 i think many of the classrooms could start school tomorrow
4408529 its everything from face painting by a five year old to pop the balloon
4408530 the kids had to use their imaginations to come up with the booths and we offered very little help
4408531 we just thought it would be really fun and messy
4408532 its a place where families can come and have fun and it doesnt cost money so people can just have fun
4408533 its a good way to wrap up the summer these kids see the same kids and the same counselors for eight nine weeks
4408534 this also shows parents what they do at camp all day
4408535 they went into the barnstead town hall and the employees gave them a standing ovation
4408536 they monitor the building for us and give a proposal
4408537 i feel its a direction we should seriously investigate for the district
4408538 we went out to bid and got 12 5 cents for three months because the market is constantly changing
4408539 before december we feel we can get 10 cents or less
4408540 we did not lock in because the market is fluctuating
4408541 i never thought id have to worry do we have enough fuel and at what price
4408542 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4408543 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4408544 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4408545 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4408546 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4408547 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4408548 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete

4408559 il parlamento di strasburgo e il consiglio europeo hanno protestato esprit ha scritto gli italiani sono incredibilmente duri contro i romeni e gli zingari sar incredibile ma vero
4408560 non si riveli mai vero il suo sospetto della rivista esprit ndr che stia rinascendo da noi sotto altre forme il fascismo
4408561 siamo e saremo sempre in prima linea su tutti i temi eticamente irrinunciabili
4408562 di fascista oggi in italia ci sono soltanto i toni da manganellatore che famiglia cristiana consente di usare a beppe del colle
4408563 per fortuna continua giovanardi gli argomenti usati e le immagini evocate si squalificano da sole mentre rimane il rammarico che un settimanale che entra in tutte le parrocchie italiane tenti di coinvolgere una parte del mondo cattolico in una campagna connotata da pregiudizi e livore ideologico senza precedenti
4408564 questo giornale sta perdendo colpi il suo direttore se ne sta beatamente a cullarsi sulle onde di marettimo e in questo contesto parla di pericolo fascista
4408565 il tentativo di buttarla tutta sullantifascismo quando la sinistra voleva a tutti i costi raggiungere il potere magari con il compromesso storico con la dc mi pare che fuori tempo riporti in avanti le lancette dellorologio e si accorger che quelle che io reputo fandonie le pu dire tranquillamente

4408568 alcuni che stanno al governo pensano di essere ancora nel ventennio le reazioni scomposte e nervose di alcuni ministri e di alcuni esponenti della maggioranza di governo alle critiche del settimanale cattolico famiglia cristiana sui temi della sicurezza dimostra che siamo in presenza di un esecutivo autoritario e di una maggioranza antidemocratica
4408569 la maggioranza invece di criticare gli editoriali del settimanale dovrebbe riflettere sulle note critiche molto vicine alle riflessioni del mondo cattolico pi impegnato oggi famiglia cristiana lorgano pi attento nellinterpretare quei cattolici emarginati da un sistema politico di stampo risorgimentale

4408572 this is a great place to work compassionate effective management and family style teamwork
4408573 unfortunately from what i have observed many people still are afraid of computers the fear takes two separate forms both of which come from a limited understanding of how computers work the first was typified by a film 2001 a space odyssey a fear that the computer is a thinking being with a will of its own possibly a malevolent one the second fear more recent is that because computers are so powerful and weve come to entrust them with so much of our work and lives a mistake could prove very costly and indeed im sure every one knows at least one person whos had a very costly mistake happen with a computer a hard drive wiped out by a virus an important file deleted etc so this fear is at least somewhat realistic
4408574 people always fear what they dont understand and technology is moving and growing so rapidly these days understanding it is just about impossible i do think this applies more to computers than other gadgets because computers are so powerful and seem much more mysterious
4408575 the reason people are scared of computers is not hard to understand most of the people who are leery to get into the computing lack knowledge or have false knowledge a lot is sung about computers viruses and identity theft etc but the media does not spread major advantages of computer usage the middle age and older crowd who did not grow up using computers and feel using a typewriter is good enough for them are most computers averse the older generations resist against any new technology they are used to the old way and dont have an interest and are intimidated by the new way many of my senior customers are afraid of doing something wrong and destroying expensive technology
4408576 i am not sure whether it is fear or a slew of negative emotions some people experience when confronted with technology that is new to them fear of change conservatism
4408577 the local consumer oriented computer market of 300 000 to 350 000 computers a year is divided into 15 to 20 per cent foreign brands and the rest comprises local computers of this the local branded computers enjoy a very small market minute at best rest are having locally integrated computers taking a bunch of components and putting them together
4408578 skills are improving and requirements are growing and sometime impulses rule
4408579 uses computer only as a fancy typewriter and needs the internet to save the trip to the library for the encyclopaedia or to check the weather in hunza sometimes and to send his work to publications and be in touch with friends and fellow travellers all over the world
4408580 when i began first back in 1991 i was terrified all the time id press the wrong key and lose all my data computers you know are a little like horse they know when a novice is riding them and they throw the inexperienced rider off and also kick him her i still remember the time i spent six hour on my first computer on the first day carefully saved my work as i had been told and the next morning presto it was not there that computer knew i was a novice i heard it snickering now when i know which key to press and when these machines keep asking me strange questions from time to time questions that i cannot even understand i ignore these questions i dont want to get drawn into hi tech mess
4408581 dependency of its sort and resulting reduction in reading habits are main fears of any society where the internet is a common place
4408582 i did learn my lesson the hard way i had translated a book saving the work on my system i posted the draft to one of my e mall accounts for safe keeping after it was complete i kept working on translation and the script kept changing but i did not mail the updates my labour was gone when my hard disc crashed i opened the mail but what i found was only initial draft i had to work all over again another thing even more frustrating is losing my settings customised with the help of techie friends over time with new disk it was as if working on someone elses computer there was nothing familiar there though data remains in tact but all settings vanish when the disk is formatted and windows reloaded
4408583 this subject is not talked about or discussed one of the many reasons given is that even those who do not know of this damaging aspect will learn about it through popular parley this amounts to hiding the head in the sand and is only aggravating the situation parents who cannot ensure safer surfing tend to restrict the use which in any way is not a sustainable solution
4408584 scare of railway steam engine when was invented scare of motor when it first came on the roads or scare of flying does not stop people using those vital services why inanimate machines or any thing on the internet should scare the users
4408585 i am neither geek nor nerd i am not a hacker a phreaker a programmer or any variety of technoid dweeb
4408586 weve had a number of people say to us you are kidding arent you
4408587 we are going to start prosecuting we are going to start calling the cops
4408588 i guess a lot of us think nobody is going to steal from the salvation army probably that attitude makes us a prime target
4408589 until now they have attempted to handle the problem in house but are now resigned to calling police whenever an incident occurs
4408590 they stress that the vast majority of users are law abiding but that this is a minority spoiling it for the rest
4408591 what really gets up their noses is that some of the suspects have even been given stuff in the past
4408592 that you cant go and cut down any old tree without a hearing
4408593 its the issue of the type of development the town wants and where it goes make sure it would be consistent with a planned policy
4408594 there has been quite a rise in need people from a different income level are coming residents who came in to donate in the past are now the ones who are coming in because they need help
4408595 i dont know what were going to tell the next person who comes in
4408596 some of the staples we just dont have were starting to get concerned its just going to get worse
4408597 very concerned about what is going to happen come the fall school is going to be starting soon and i dont have any school snacks for anybody
4408598 when youre going through something like this you feel like theres not a whole lot you can do and so for me this feels like an opportunity to do something
4408599 the people involved are very appreciative of all you do
4408600 my moms death inspired me to raise awareness and educate people let as many people as i can know that its not an old persons disease this is affecting people in their 30s to 50s
4408601 im sure that people will take advantage of this situation because of the gas prices
4408602 were going to be able to offer so many more services and i think that the townspeople will be happy about it
4408603 weve got a lot of good people in town and i want to offer them all that we can in our office and be able to keep that business in the town
4408604 the seafood festival is happening and applecrest orchards gets up and running that weekend but it the jumper classic should be a benefit to our local economy
4408605 while we were there at myopia the caliber and level of the sport rose
4408606 this is a riders horse show so we take athletes considerations like the training surface seriously
4408607 i try to eat right but its hard with all the junk food sometimes i do cardio and weight lifting with my mom
4408608 i worked at a weight loss camp in california 11 years ago and absolutely loved it
4408609 as a fitness instructor i dont tell anyone to deprive themselves
4408610 its a great exercise and keeps you healthy i know im going to be strong when i grow up
4408611 healthy food is good for you but you can have a little junk food just a teensy bit
4408612 me and my sister really wanted to go to fitness camp i learned that fruit and vegetables are good for you and i learned to draw a cherry tree
4408613 they sit down all the time when i was a kid i was outside all the time
4408614 its important to learn early on an active healthy lifestyle
4408615 we color food pyramids we do kid anatomy and self esteem activities
4408616 the only piece of information used from the elementary schools nwea was math placement
4408617 other than that they dont really put a lot of stock into it
4408618 it tells us whether a person has a high medium or low proficiency in certain areas but as a teacher what does it tell you
4408619 im just looking at it fiscally we are talking about 4 600 to 4 800 to administer the tests
4408620 we had no idea he was so proficient in math
4408621 its a common score through elementary middle and high school as a parent i am a proponent of it
4408622 i can clearly look at my son chases stats and see where he is weaker and where he is stronger
4408623 i like it i think it maps growth and i think it is important to see it at the middle school
4408624 if a question is brought to me about a childs progress this can show progress
4408625 i can look at the data but its how you evaluate the data thats important
4408626 when we hired our assistant principal last year we as a board were looking forward to her helping with the nweas
4408627 weve got this data that isnt really being used to its fullest
4408628 i think its a great test and with all of the time money and resources we have invested in this i dont think we should let it fall by the wayside
4408629 it was a very tragic accident and a tremendous loss for the community
4408630 theres not one kid here who cant say they havent eaten in my house at some point
4408631 people just drew to him luke he just had something there was nothing fake about him he was just realistic

4408634 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4408635 the white house had concocted a fake letter from the director of the iraqi intelligence service to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
4408636 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
4408637 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
4408638 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document from habbash as outlined in mr suskinds book
4408639 he told me to calm down then started hitting me
4408640 the two of them were squared off on the front lawn
4408641 in a perfect world we would love to have five strong candidates running for the seats
4408642 were asking them to do a lot and its unfortunate that we have to rely on people who are willing to do this in their spare time
4408643 it would be presumptuous to think any seat is guaranteed
4408644 we did it last year for the precincts 100th anniversary and we thought this is something we should be doing every year
4408645 he basically transformed the casino into what it is today
4408646 he purchased the property back in 1979 and now they are celebrating their 30th anniversary
4408647 the mcginnis family would always come up and spend their summers at hampton beach
4408648 i think they held it from the casino restaurant which is now the whales tale
4408649 he and his family also represented hampton beach at the world fair in new york in 1964
4408650 there are 15 circles on the map and every circle has a clue
4408651 the clues will help you find the key to the treasure chest
4408652 were paying for something that we already paid for thats how i am looking at it
4408653 if you dont have the surplus in a certain range bond rating agencies look at it it could cost the school and town money
4408654 it was going to rub people the wrong way if the money goes to the fund balance and into the capital reserve accounts
4408655 mom never finished school and shes done all right for herself why shouldnt i quit
4408656 the idea is to let them assimilate without all the chaos
4408657 starting high school is an overwhelming situation and for the freshmen coming through the doors it can be intimidating we began the delayed opening several years ago so that the students coming through the door for the first time can have some time to themselves to get their bearings its worked out well in past years and were glad to be able to continue doing it i feel it really does help alleviate a lot of anxiety and confusion and its a great way to help make the students more comfortable
4408658 it can be difficult for these students to go from being the oldest and wisest pupils in their school to being the youngest and newest
4408659 so weve found that by delaying the rest of the students a few hours makes a big difference in how the incoming freshmen assimilate themselves
4408660 the entire front line of the armys brass stepped down because of the war gal hirsch who was defeated in lebanon went to georgia and they too lost because of him
4408661 the lack of more substantive knowledge with respect to accounting and finance matters among past elected officials and the towns administrative staff was the root cause of the failure to recognize significant and in some cases serious deficiencies
4408662 it also appears that some of the auditors concerns were not shared with the entire select board
4408663 in my capacity as chair of the conservation commissions meeting of june 10 there has been a general perception that the conduct of a portion of the meeting and certain of my comments or questions concerning the affected boy scout were inappropriate
4408664 while these events were not my intent for these oversights i hereby publicly and sincerely apologize
4408665 in a manner which was not beneficial to all concerned
4408666 we really need to look at any way we can save energy
4408667 do something thoughtful and do it as part of the budget process
4408668 we use a lot of cream and weve been seeing an increase there every other month
4408669 ive been in this business since the 1950s and i cant remember when ive ever seen prices jump this much so quickly anything that comes in by truck has gone up
4408670 our economic stimulus check served mostly to cover the rising cost of our medical benefits
4408671 its important to balance the need to protect wildlife with the need to use the lake for societal needs
4408672 its important to kennecott that the selenium standard is set to a scientifically defensible level
4408673 we want people to look professionally so people will feel comfortable interacting with our employees
4408674 when a police officer shows up you dont want to see a nazi tattoo on their forehead or a ring around their nose
4408675 weve come a long way since things were so judgmental
4408676 some people dont feel comfortable with interacting with people that are that way
4408677 we would rather have a full cadre of lenders but that is unlikely to happen in the near future until congress raises the yields
4408678 now were calling on congress and the departments of treasury and education to take additional action to further stabilize the student loan program for years to come
4408679 were in a pretty good place a much better place than our sister agencies across the country
4408680 from the students perspective this will work we will be able to help them without depleting our resources
4408681 im not aware of lenders offering better terms than what uheaa is offering
4408682 we encourage students to research who theyre going to get loans from and find the best terms they can get they are going to have to pay more interest thats unfortunate
4408683 i would sincerely hope that the italian parliament would pass this law
4408684 these workers are doing one of the most vital jobs in the airport but are among the lowest paid
4408685 access sports medicine and orthopaedics understands how important it is for us to give back to the community
4408686 the sports physical clinics that we offer are just a couple of the many different community programs that we are involved with throughout the year for example just next week we are hosting a blood drive
4408687 twenty years ago we used to do this crazy exam
4408688 while this doesnt take the place of kids annual physical we are looking for the things that can be catastrophic heart palpitations family history breathing issues heat and exhaustion to play sports this is almost like another level of check
4408689 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4408690 g dels theorem implies that pure mathematics is inexhaustible no matter how many problems we solve there will always be other problems that cannot be solved within the existing rules because of g dels theorem physics is inexhaustible too the laws of physics are a finite set of rules and include the rules for doing mathematics so that g dels theorem applies to them

4408696 the nabucco pipeline now is dependent not only on gas from the caucuses and from east of the caspian but also from iran

4408699 if you want to know the truth i think its a good test for our team
4408700 if you stay in the hunt and you battle it out and we win i think that tells us what kind of team we are theres two ways to look at it if we get down and we dont come back were not champions and were not men
4408701 take heed and beware of covetousness for ones life does not consist in the abundance of the things he possesses
4408702 no servant can serve two masters either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other you cannot serve both god and money lk 16 13 think about it which one controls your life
4408703 you need more of this you wont be happy without that you need to look this way and have these things in order to be accepted respected and valued by others
4408704 it is harder for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god then it is for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
4408705 religion that god our father accepts as pure and faultless is this to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep one self from being polluted by the world
4408706 do not merely listen to the word and so deceive yourselves do what it says
4408707 im not going to lie to you and tell you it was easy
4408708 i could have lost my eyesight i could have lost consciousness i could have lost my life
4408709 amy looked a bit out of it and was really getting agitated by the amount of attention she was receiving no one was quite sure when she would lash out next
4408710 i want to make sure that if and when we do it its really good its perfect
4408711 itll be very limited i want to make sure and im not quite certain yet but we should have answers very shortly
4408712 weve spent a lot of time doing a lot of wiring of ballparks doing a lot of checking
4408713 every game i watch theres a bat splintered im sensitive about it and we need to move ahead
4408714 its still long if i come back next year it will be shorter
4408715 he came in and showed me as billy crystal said in analyze that its a process he took a little bit off its within the rules of cleaning it up a little bit right now its around his shoulders its not covering his name up well continue to monitor it
4408716 he says every time he gets a hit its the hair i say its the ability he knows as well as everybody else around here that his ability is special hes a character

4408720 you know that positive energy can lift you that negative energy can bring you down
4408721 in think in the first half that the defense played very solid football
4408722 you cant have that many drops and expect to move the ball consistently and we have to cut down on the penalties
4408723 for me it was about working on ball placement i just tried to get the ball in a position where they could come down with it and possibly pick up yards
4408724 severe conditions advising fans to take cover in the concourses
4408725 i wouldnt have been upset if they had called it its dangerous out here with lightning
4408726 any time you have a preseason game you take the good and the bad
4408727 am i disappointed the way we played sure that series
4408728 its like youre trying to crank the car up a bit more every week
4408729 weve given up a couple long drives carolina didnt score this time pittsburgh was able to score on theirs so we just have to make sure we dont give up those long drives and get off the field bring it out and get some turnovers too
4408730 but i talked to my brother and he told me that i hadnt given it enough time hadnt given it a fair chance that 3 weeks wasnt long enough so i gave it a chance
4408731 i get an apartment on 43rd street in west philly
4408732 im going to be away on a 12 day road trip and i know that on tuesdays you have to move the car so they can sweep the street so i put it in a garage but i havent unpacked yet so there are golf clubs binoculars a record player other good stuff in the trunk
4408733 i come back after the trip and go to get the car and theres a lot of scurrying around i get in the car and im driving and the odometer has been disconnected there are cigarette butts in the ashtray theyve been driving the car the whole time i open the trunk and everythings gone
4408734 and i said i really might have to rethink this philly thing but i stayed
4408735 merchant told me we want to inform em we want to entertain em and every once in a while we want to surprise em thats what ive tried to do
4408736 treatment strategies have to consider that in a significant portion of young patients initial recovery may not be stable over time
4408737 coach marty mornhinweg and coach reid have a lot of things in the offense for me jackson said
4408738 they have a lot of confidence in me and are giving me an opportunity to help this team out i feel im better from the last game to this game coming off the ball running my routes
4408739 the volume got to him a little bit as we got toward the end of our installs in the spring minicamps thats understandable i wasnt shocked by it hes an intelligent kid and he wants to be good he has that drive well see how he continues here
4408740 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought it was offensive
4408741 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
4408742 the problem with michael phelps is there is no competition where he is now if he came to where im from which is the inner city liberty city miami i was the three time charles hadley pool champ i know a couple of people that could be michael phelps right now and im one of them
4408743 if you play him enough times hes bound to have an off day
4408744 i proved that i played with the best tonight and it couldnt have happened to me on a better stage
4408745 i missed some key shots that i probably shouldnt have missed
4408746 but i respect them so much to be here in their own country i can only imagine the pressure they were under we had a little pressure on us going in as world champions but with their being at home and expected to win they worked hard for it we worked hard for it but it was their day
4408747 i know i had so many doubters the last few years with my injuries
4408748 she was rock solid she has her ability to do her best at the most important moment even in the big arena
4408749 i heard the red wings put in a claim on me
4408750 you see a happy vacation spot we can send people to
4408751 i dont so well have to do the best we can
4408752 as the manager of the team there were two fundamental responsibilities
4408753 one was to win the game and the second was just as important to get everyone home safely
4408754 there is no easy answer we knew the game was going to be played to its completion
4408755 he has a brand new pitch that he didnt have and its good
4408756 i think everyone in the bullpen was hurt its saying we cant do our jobs
4408757 i heard the red wings put in a claim on me
4408758 you see a happy vacation spot we can send people to
4408759 i dont so well have to do the best we can

4408772 if he wasnt in the sport of swimming i dont think id be swimming as well lochte said
4408773 hes up there and i want to become better than him i cant say without him id be where i am
4408774 thats an unbelievable thing for him its a cool moment phelps said
4408775 to be a player in that race i have to force the first 50 meters if im there itll be a race
4408776 i have to conserve as much physical and emotional energy as i can he explained
4408777 it was a best time but i think i was just disappointed that i know i can go faster than that
4408778 dude its ridiculous how many times a day i have to see your ugly face
4408779 a lot of times fans worldwide in general they say well you are making all this money you are supposed to take it or i paid to come to the game so i can let you know anything and say anything i want
4408780 well i have kids ive got a wife ive got mom and dad before i was a ballplayer i was a person and i am a person the same way you are so you say something as a person forget the uniform as a person i could say something back but because of the uniform i the fans can say anything i want to you and thats your armor thats your shield its just not true not at all
4408781 i might catch some flak for saying this but you know theyre front runners when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre doing bad theyre completely against you
4408782 its not me its booing the guy who is out there working hard and busting his butt
4408783 thats when i really get upset ive always said that whatever you want to do against me i can deal with myself and im sure he could deal with it too but thats my teammate i know the work he is putting in i see what he is doing trying to get better and you are crushing him thats what makes me upset
4408784 in the 8 years weve been getting closer and closer last year we finally got over one obstacle and we are still working to get over another one
4408785 and its our fault as players for saying well we understand why because of this
4408786 i never want them to win as long as im playing dont get me wrong but take the team that you have and push them to be better dont take black friday i just found that out dont take black friday and put it on these new guys half of them dont even know it i didnt know it until 15 minutes ago 20 minutes ago black friday i was like is that like palm sunday you know about the history of the team dont get me wrong but when you are there you are trying to change that for that time period my tenure here were we successful thats all you can control
4408787 i dont think right at this moment hes a dl possibility
4408788 i dont need to talk about the all star game
4408789 we had this game circled ever since it came out
4408790 a few of us felt like we needed this game to show we mean business and are serious about the gold medal
4408791 i had a lady cry when she came up to me
4408792 she came up to me asked me for an autograph and as i started to sign it she started crying literally crying i couldnt believe that i felt like the pope for a minute i just play basketball
4408793 we say it all the time we feel like the beatles
4408794 theres nothing like it the chinese have been outstanding whenever we leave the hotel go to the athletes village they are there urging us on its greatly appreciated and were going to need it
4408795 the other day it was pouring down raining and there was still a group outside of about 100 kids just waiting chasing the bus in the rain
4408796 we come out here every summer to do clinics and stuff like that and i have always been pretty popular but i dont know when this happened
4408797 were busting our rear ends its not like were trying to lose
4408798 we got outpitched outplayed you dont get swept in a series if the other team doesnt outplay you
4408799 its tough man everybodys going out there were trying right now its just kind of unexplainable
4408800 were not getting a lot of hits and getting key hits when we need them right now its just weird ive never really been a part of anything like this before
4408801 we played like we wanted to win we played together
4408802 we were very aware of their offensive sets we were very aware of their personnel and we played like that so we were kind of a step in front of what they wanted to do because we kind of knew everything already
4408803 its a good organization and if they can use him thats great
4408804 i think it should be successful i did everything he asked me to do
4408805 deux raisons nous ont pouss s d caler cette sortie l t prochain nous savons que l t est la p riode id ale pour la sortie dune production familiale comme le prouve le succ s de qui affiche le second plus gros cumul de recettes de la franchise derri re le premier volet par ailleurs comme les autres studios nous subissons encore les contrecoups de la gr ve des sc naristes contrecoups qui ont eu un impact sur la mise en chantier de certains autres de nos films et qui ont donc modifi la donne sur le march pour 2009 et nous ouvrant de nouvelles fen tres et de nouvelles opportunit s la meilleure strat gie tait donc de d caler harry potter et le prince de sang m l juillet o le film trouve sa place comme lune des sorties majeures de l t 2009
4408806 ce changement de date ne modifie en rien le calendrier de production de ce film et des autres films de la franchise la post production sur
4408807 quand jeff robinov ma fait part de cette d cision et du pourquoi de cette d cision jai tout de suite compris que cela offrirait au film un public encore plus large je suis tr s fier de ce sixi me film et du travail incroyable de david yates et de nos acteurs je crois que nous continuons de repousser les limites nous sommes impatients de partager ce film avec les fans m me si nous devons attendre un peu plus longtemps que pr vu

4408809 its unlike anything weve seen in the trading card category
4408810 im very excited that i can continue with the organization and help the team keep moving in the direction were going
4408811 its exciting to be a part of the team that is building towards the ultimate goal
4408812 he is a very energetic coach who brings a lot of enthusiasm and passion to the game and we look forward to working together over the next few years
4408813 my family and i are very happy in the area and im very excited about the upcoming year
4408814 last season we knew that in order for us to improve a lot of our young players needed to mature and each one of them did this offseason paul holmgren did a great job of keeping players here as best we could and continued to improve our team i think were ahead of where we were last year i think were doing a great job of being physically ready and also we have a great attitude
4408815 every day i try to get better as a head coach and i think i am
4408816 i have almost 2 full years now i know what works for us and i know how to prepare for the opponents i feel comfortable
4408817 i think with that score i can be up there with the medals im just going to swing big
4408818 randolph made statements that he would be back to kill our victim
4408819 neither one of us could probably answer why we were getting one in the first place
4408820 things have been going so great that someone actually had to remind us that hey you do remember those papers are still there literally it was days ago
4408821 so weve agreed that before we leave florida in a few days well make sure that thats gone away
4408822 the kids and i kind of learned about the divorce at the same time
4408823 so that was hard that was probably the worst part of the whole thing was being able to deal with how hurt the kids were
4408824 it was kind of cool to sit back there and watch all that happen
4408825 that was the first time that i tried doing it i was all in
4408826 i dont believe ive ever seen that especially between two pitchers
4408827 i dont believe ive ever seen four in a row between two pitchers and that many runs given up in a one run ballgame with two outs
4408828 you see a lot of special things whether its a guy hitting his 500th home run this was more like you probably wont see it again you might see it once if you play the game for 10 or 15 years
4408829 the first two you dont feel it the third one is the one you start feeling it three in a row

4408833 more gains in the greenback should expose crude oil prices to further downside potential
4408834 this could keep precious metal investment demand at bay today
4408835 excess liquidity is what got us into this situation in the first place
4408836 the loans and liquidity the us government provided hasnt cured the situation we have to clear all the bad debts and silly spending no amount of government spending can hurry that process or help alleviate that
4408837 its still early to say its the end of the super cycle but if the markets continue to fall like they are doing now i am sure many people will be talking about it very soon
4408838 many of the shakier speculators and investors have probably baled out in the last few days
4408839 they will probably not be seen in the market for sometime to come
4408840 physical demand is back again and this will most likely get stronger from sept onwards the increase in net production if any at all is happening at a very slow pace and secondary supplies are reducing
4408841 our colleagues from hong kong report that after the recent price drop they have seen robust demand coming not only from the jewelry sector but also from other industrial end users
4408842 as a result after being net exporter from hong kong in the recent past mainly due to getting in masses of scrap gold heraeus is now back to being a net importer
4408843 i guess you could say ive had an easy road until now
4408844 the vultures have never circled over me before but ill deal with it
4408845 i understand the criticism i dont close my eyes to it but i dont have to accept all of it as well
4408846 some of it is true and i take that on board and i try to change
4408847 i accept that there is a responsibility i know there are certain traditions at west ham and ive been brought up on that
4408848 people have to understand that we were patched up a lot of times last season and quite often the team picked itself given the injuries we had but i accept the criticism
4408849 you know it was one of those rounds i just kind of when i had to hole 8 6 10 footer for par i did
4408850 i holed first about a 8 footer or 10 footer for par that was a funny sense kind of a good start a momentum builder then holed a nice put on 2
4408851 after that i played real solid didnt really look like making bogey the rest of the day maybe on 16 the par 3 i had to hole about a 6 footer it was a real good round hit it good and as i said putted well
4408852 definitely its something im thinking about actually started the week before reno i was rooming with chez reavie in toronto when he won
4408853 i saw his win from wire to wire every step with him because at night he would come back and talk about it whatever

4408885 i expect commodity prices to remain subdued until mid 2009 said arjuna mahendran head of investment strategy at hsbc private bank in singapore
4408886 the major issue in commodities is the proliferation of etfs and hedge funds as they unwind positions this leads to the price overshooting

4408913 the difference in mental health outcomes between child soldiers and never conscripted children can be explained in part by greater exposure to traumatic events among child soldiers especially for general psychological difficulties and function impairment
4408914 the study has several clinical and programmatic implications first the greater burden of mental health problems among former child soldiers supports the need for focused programming which should include but not consist solely of interventions to reduce depression symptoms and the psychological sequelae of trauma especially bombings and torture as well as incorporate belongingness and income generation second girl soldiers may require focused attention possibly for factors not addressed in this study such as problems of sexual violence and reintegration difficulties third the variation in type and severity of mental health problems highlights the importance of screening including locally developed measures of function impairment as a base for intervention
4408915 without screening there is a risk of pathologizing child soldiers as a group rather than providing support to those individuals most impaired finally the presence of mental health problems among never conscripted children illustrates the need for comprehensive postconflict community based psychosocial care not restricted only to child soldiers
4408916 we know there is a strong relationship between pre pregnancy obesity and preeclampsia and at least a third of all pregnant women in the united states are obese
4408917 our work represents the first multidisciplinary evaluation of the possible mechanisms of the disease process as it relates to obesity
4408918 that are posing one of the greatest health threats in human history
4408919 preeclampsia is complex with components involving improper vascular growth and functioning in the placenta inflammation and other factors obesity also is related to inflammation oxidative stress insulin resistance abnormal fatty acids and a host of other metabolic concerns
4408920 these adverse effects of obesity on pregnancy also may be affected by lifestyle sleep patterns activity and diet
4408921 this collaboration is an important step in building the infrastructure necessary to enable the use of aposense in our upcoming clinical trials and ultimately commercialization in the u s
4408922 we are excited to partner with iba a world leader in the production of radio isotopes for imaging and therapeutics and about our shared vision of the potential role that aposense can play in helping to improve patient care in multiple disease areas
4408923 this agreement is an important milestone in the expansion of our leading position in the field of radiopharmaceutical products after the announcement in may with wilex ag this is the second agreement for a novel agent in the field of pet radiopharmaceuticals and it confirms our strategy of offering technology materials and services to medical imaging centers from a single source we very much look forward to our enhanced cooperation
4408924 certainly there are times when a c section offers women their families and healthcare providers a necessary and lifesaving birthing solution
4408925 however this alarming citywide increase underscores how c section has become a method of convenience rather than necessity even though it can present tremendous risks for an expecting mother just as alarming our citys hospitals have no strategy to reduce the rate we urge families and the medical community to remember that the highest level of medical intervention is not always required and is not necessarily the safest option for the mother and child
4408926 im really concerned that the c section rate continues to rise at so many of our citys hospitals
4408927 were making some positive strides as new yorks hospitals are finally complying with the legal requirement to release this data however theres much more work to be done to ensure that women receive the best and most medically appropriate care and that hospitals take strong steps towards reducing the c section rate information is essential especially when youre dealing with the health of mothers and children this is why i have introduced legislation which will require the city to create an online database to allow mothers to find hospital information quickly and easily and help them make safe informed decisions
4408928 the american healthcare system is increasingly dependent upon medical interventions to address what is most often a normal and safe physiological process natural childbirth and this new data shows that new york city is mapping to the trend
4408929 quite often women are not fully informed of the risks associated with commonly performed obstetrical interventions nor do they know there are options beyond hospital birth however as new york city women are becoming more aware of the state of standard maternity care in this city we have seen an incredible increase in demand for services outside of the hospital
4408930 we should be concerned about the long term risks of having so many women in the united states undergo major abdominal surgery particularly those who do so when they are young
4408931 i urge my colleagues and peers across the city to be open to innovative means of changing how maternity care is delivered in new york and to help develop solutions that work towards reducing the c section rate
4408932 in my research animal models dont represent human patients sufficiently well
4408933 and thats a problem that extends across pain research as a whole new and highly sophisticated brain imaging technology is providing vital insights that animal research has failed to produce i would like to see far greater uptake of these and other human relevant approaches to pain research to help us develop the effective treatments that patients so desperately need
4408934 its clear that experimenting on animals isnt an ethical or even relevant route to study the complexity of human pain
4408935 it is critical that these often simplistic experiments are replaced with more advanced techniques that dont involve inflicting animal suffering powerful brain imaging machines could help revolutionise pain research globally and speed up the development of pain killing drugs providing much needed hope for chronic pain sufferers but the enormous potential of imaging approaches will only be realised if the government and the research funders make a concerted effort to invest in these human focused technologies
4408936 the pharmas awards embrace all aspects of pharmacy being awarded a pharmas award is a great honour and will help to boost the winners pharmacy profile it is proof to peers colleagues and patients that their work has been judged to be amongst the best in the pharmacy field
4408937 dna vaccines offer a promising avenue of pursuit in aids vaccine development

4408945 cluster bombs are indiscriminate killers that most nations have agreed to outlaw
4408946 russias use of this weapon is not only deadly to civilians but also an insult to international efforts to avoid a global humanitarian disaster of the kind caused by landmines
4408947 russian georgian and south ossetian forces all have an obligation under international humanitarian law to protect civilians from attack
4408948 the latest information on civilian casualties in gori tskhinvali and surrounding areas calls into question whether the forces are respecting that obligation
4408949 victims of the attack described to human rights watch how they saw numerous small explosions within seconds before they fell to the ground
4408950 some of them had been hit by rockets most likely fired from grad launchers weapons that should not be used in areas populated by civilians as they cannot be directed at only military targets and are therefore inherently indiscriminate
4408951 we burned these houses we want to make sure that they the georgians cant come back because if they do come back this will be a georgian enclave again and this should not happen
4408952 two of them didnt do anything to us so we just let them go we couldnt take them anywhere as i had to take care of my own men first the third one seemed to be high on something a normal person would have surrendered and this one was shooting at us instead we questioned him and then executed him
4408953 people are continuing to arrive in north ossetia by the busload and many civilians are wounded
4408954 world vision has also found that many families have been separated from their loved ones in the chaos
4408955 the amount of cases being reported across europe shows the disease is on the move this most recent case in holland demonstrates that not vaccinating livestock leaves farmers vulnerable to outbreaks now the midge season has started
4408956 the industry has rallied behind the jab campaign and has done tremendously well in terms of vaccination
4408957 the explosion in the number of cases on the continent also acts as a timely reminder to those farmers in the current protection zone who have not vaccinated and the dangers this presents to their unprotected livestock
4408958 we are entering the peak period for midge activity so vaccination is the only way to prepare and protect us from any potential outbreaks that may emerge in the coming weeks
4408959 i appeal for the help of every civilized person in the world to stop this uncivilized barbarian inhuman treacherous absolutely outrageous behavior and to save innocent lives
4408960 the fact that the biggest number of bombs fell on purely economic and civilian targets clearly indicated that was a premeditated thing and it had nothing to do only with abkhazia or south ossetia
4408961 better jobs better care new research on the long term care workforce
4408962 were asking v festival visitors to join the 15 6 million other superheroes who have already joined the odr and to discuss their wishes with their families
4408963 more than 7 800 people in the uk are currently waiting for an organ transplant and the sad fact is that over 1 000 of them will die while waiting due to an acute shortage of donors
4408964 young people are fantastic supporters of organ donation 30 of people on the register were aged between 16 and 25 when they joined
4408965 we are hoping that lots of festival goers will visit the uk transplant stand have a go at being a superhero and sign up to the nhs organ donor register and pledge to give the gift of life
4408966 taking the superhero theme of the campaign the game gives users the opportunity to upload their picture to make themselves a superhero and pass the results onto friends and family
4408967 it is designed to be fun with a serious message that we hope people will pass on everyone can be a superhero and save a life by joining the nhs organ donor register superhero me means they can also make themselves look like one
4408968 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
4408969 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
4408970 no evidence sufficient to support the claim that an observed association between abortion history and mental health was caused by the abortion per se as opposed to other factors
4408971 global statements about the psychological impact of abortion can be misleading
4408972 help disentangle confounding factors and establish relative risks of abortion compared to its alternatives
4408973 children who consumed 2 or more servings of dairy and 4 ounces of meat or other nondairy protein had bone mineral contents over 300 grams higher than those children with lower intakes of both dairy and other proteins
4408974 dairy is a key source of proteins calcium and other micronutrients including phosphorus and vitamin d
4408975 effects of average childhood dairy intake on adolescent bone health

4408978 we look forward to this promotion with stanford blood center every year
4408979 its a great cause and the athletics department is happy to be able to support it
4408980 with approximately 20 percent of our blood supply coming from high school and college students on mobile blood drives it is important that we continue to bring in donors when school is not in session otherwise we risk facing shortages in our inventory
4408981 the results of this study are very encouraging with the potential to change the way stable angina is managed due to concerns regarding the tolerability of beta blockers patients tend to receive low doses which may not provide optimal heart rate reduction the results of this study suggest that the combination of ivabradine and atenolol shows real promise in the treatment of patients with stable angina
4408982 the u s mint buys direct from the refiners and this suspension of gold eagle sales may be an indication that the supply line is already backing up or that the mint expects that it will back up for the rest of the year i wonder who would give up physical metal at these prices and under these circumstances except distressed sellers the central banks are in a hunker down mode as far as i can determine and its the mines that supply the refiners so if the mint which buys from the refiners is having a difficult time locating metal what does that tell you i keep saying that we may get a surprising rubber band effect later in the year when the pre holiday festival season kicks off in september october it may happen sooner one of our indicators of approaching a bottom in gold is how many calls centennial precious metals gets from our u s based indian clientele heres a quote from my offices report to me at the end of the day today today was a good day there must have been an indian convention where someone was handing out usagold business cards that may give you a clue as to thinking in india proper and probably the rest of the asian rim

4409039 all systems should be unified and integrated at the soonest possible time i think taking into consideration the forthcoming three year budget these tasks should be resolved and money of the tax payers will be used effectively
4409040 lap dancing clubs are in contradiction to efforts to promote gender equality
4409041 yet by boxing lap dancing clubs into the same licensing category as cafes and concurrently requiring the promotion of gender equality the hands of local authorities have been tied
4409042 our towns and cities should be shaped as far as possible according to residents wishes not by the presence of unwanted lap dancing clubs in the heart of them
4409043 lap dance clubs fuel a sexist culture of treating women as sex objects areas surrounding lap dance clubs can become no go areas for women
4409044 the only viable solution is to license lap dancing clubs as sex encounter establishments
4409045 no club or organization which is sex based or based upon any kind of sexual grouping orientation or activity of any kind shall be permitted

4409070 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4409071 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst

4409073 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al

4409078 connecticut citizens as well as visitors to our state have every reason to expect cautious and courteous driving by state employees
4409079 they have every right to let us know if anyone in a state vehicle is not obeying the rules of the road this is really another way to ensure that state government is responsive to the citizens it serves
4409080 the most frequent complaints received about fleet vehicles are that the driver was going too fast or that the driver appeared to be talking on their cell phone
4409081 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4409082 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view

4409087 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4409088 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects

4409090 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4409091 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4409092 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4409093 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender

4409097 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4409098 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4409099 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4409100 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4409101 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country

4409109 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4409110 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4409111 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4409112 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4409113 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4409114 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4409115 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure

4409126 unsere aufgabe ist es unser zentrum absolut dicht zu halten
4409127 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4409128 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4409129 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4409130 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4409131 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4409132 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4409133 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4409134 people say high wycombe survived the luftwaffe but not the urban planners of the 1960s
4409135 cathy and i looked back at the headlines from the 1960s and saw the doom and gloom newspapers spell for so called
4409136 but those headlines are little different from the ones we see today weve learnt absolutely nothing and why because the drive behind the development is always the same money
4409137 the basic idea we came up with was to look at the way people connect to an area and how this can be disrupted
4409138 how is this something we should be aspiring to and how does that affect the people who live there
4409139 high wycombe was once known for better things such as producing two prime ministers the earl of shelburne and disraeli how many other towns can lay claim to that
4409140 apparently there is a saying that the river wye gave the town its mills the mills produced the market and the market gave birth to the town
4409141 its where the early translators of the bible found support where engish civil war took root where the quakers plotted their flight to america the us air force based their cold war communications and where raf strike command still rests in the hills
4409142 ive travelled a lot in the past around india and australia and i think its really helped to heighten my senses
4409143 i can wander around places with innocent eyes and even the most mundane things are fascinating to me
4409144 my investigation threw up all kinds of fascinating things i never knew before i discovered an ancient footpath in green street which stretches back to before the romans possibly 5 000 years maybe earlier
4409145 theres so many little footpaths everywhere and who knows where they lead
4409146 some seem like they dont go anywhere but the important thing is that they once did
4409147 the main thing is that we found another wycombe we found our own town we ignored the maps and we discovered a town that still has a very strong spirit of place that cant be taken away whatever lies ahead
4409148 the modern avenue served as laboratory for the fl neur while the contemporary street finds the neo fl neur manipulating the mediating filters of technology in pursuit of new connections to the landscape

4409150 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

4409152 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4409153 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4409154 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4409155 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4409156 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4409157 our 14 offices are part of a highly structured volunteer heavy plan to win in new hampshire
4409158 we are creating neighborhood teams with volunteers who are trained equipped and empowered to build a campaign organization in their own neighborhood
4409159 i think weve built on that grass roots effort from 2004

4409177 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
4409178 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film released july 11 2007 which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4409179 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films

4409207 on the campaign trail john mccain claims that he fought to expose jack abramoff and his corrupt cronies
4409208 it was a scandal that rocked the country linking all the way to the bush white house and republicans in congress sending two former republican congressmen to prison
4409209 but now desperate to raise campaign cash to run more negative attack ads john mccain is cozying up to jack abramoffs cronies
4409210 ralph reed a key business partner of jack abramoff helped the convicted former republican lobbyist launder 2 million dollars through a front group to finance a gambling campaign

4409214 ich sagte immer zu mir selbst das ist zu seltsam
4409215 und leo meinte bringen wirs hinter uns und ich sagte ja nur zur erinnerung du bist mein bester freund er ist mein mann es ist ein wenig unheimlich
4409216 mir war nicht klar gewesen wie viel chemie mit ihm seit titanic noch da war
4409217 ich gebe zu es ist ziemlich bizarr meiner frau als regisseur zu sagen wie sie liebe machen soll aber das ist immer schwierig ob man verheiratet ist oder nicht
4409218 ich konnte mir nicht vorstellen dass er sich nicht f r diese geschichte und dies charaktere entscheidet
4409219 also habe ich dieses raffinierte katz und maus spiel inszeniert um meinen mann und dann meinen besten freund zusammenzubringen
4409220 mit blo en augen l sst sich das nicht f r jeden tag genau festlegen
4409221 erstmals hat ein entwicklungsland die olympischen spiele zum anlass genommen f r kologische ver nderungen
4409222 das muss nicht unbedingt eine manipulation sein in einer sich dynamisch ver ndernden stadt wie peking ist es wissenschaftlich korrekt die messstandorte permanent zu ver ndern
4409223 was wir jedoch brauchen ist mehr transparenz dar ber warum die verlegungen stattfinden
4409224 deutschland r hmt sich ein kologisch ausgerichtetes land zu sein aber es sind vor allem wagen von deutschen autoherstellern die die stra en pekings verstopfen
4409225 f r die umwelt hat es sich ausgezahlt dass peking die olympischen spiele bekommen hat
4409226 gelbe karten geh ren zu meinem spiel wenn ich in dieser saison sieben bekomme und wir werden meister ist alles okay
4409227 in wahrheit mache ich mir keine gedanken dar ber spielf hrer zu sein das ist wichtiger f r den verein als f r mich
4409228 ich muss zwei drei momente pro saison drauf achten dass ich mich unter kontrolle habe
4409229 das ist eigentlich zu kurz aber wir bringen beide viel erfahrung mit und sind inzwischen nicht nur bei starkwind sehr schnell sondern haben auch die leichten winde gut im griff
4409230 die medaille ist f r uns kein traum sie ist m glich
4409231 ich wusste nicht wie ich seine freundin und steuerfrau sein sollte
4409232 ich wusste nicht mehr wie ich gleichzeitig seine freundin und seine steuerfrau sein sollte ich wollte perfekt sein doch das war einfach zuviel f r mich es hat mich zerst rt irgendwann waren meine batterien restlos alle und wir mussten handeln
4409233 viele fanden das verr ckt wir hielten es f r normal aber nat rlich sind wir in dieser zeit oft mit den k pfen gegen die wand gelaufen das tat weh doch wir sind auch beide in dieser situation als menschen gewachsen
4409234 wenn wir nicht auf dem wasser sind dann ist es wie eine andere welt wir reden nicht einmal viel ber das segeln
4409235 aber einer unserer gr ten vorteile ist nat rlich dass jemand der das gleiche tut wie du dich besser versteht wir wissen meist wie wir uns gegenseitig gut verstehen und behandeln
4409236 ich mag es nicht wenn sie mich schl gt aber ich mag es auch nicht wenn mich sonst jemand besiegt
4409237 ich m chte dass sie hier wirklich gut abschneidet gold und silber zu gewinnen w re ein traum solange wir es sind die gold gewinnen da drau en auf dem wasser werden wir ihr keinen millimeter schenken und sie uns auch nicht
4409238 aber fahrt doch die kleine runde so hat papa die m glichkeit zwischendurch auszusteigen
4409239 geld f r sp ter zur cklegen kann ich aber kaum
4409240 daf r habe ich aber 15 schl ssel f r verschiedene wohnungen von freunden und familie in holland und ganz europa
4409241 ich w re sogar stolz auf sie wenn sie nicht meine freundin w re
4409242 ich wiege 62 kilogramm sebbe 92 wir bringen als mannschaft den gr ten gewichtsunterschied mit als steuerfrau kann ich mit einigen ver nderungen an bord wirklich gut sein vorschoterin dagegen k nnte eine frau im tornado auf h chstem niveau niemals sein der job w re physisch zu anstrengend
4409243 deswegen bleibe ich zwar im herzen holl nderin doch die medaille w rde ich schon f r belgien gewinnen
4409244 das ist nat rlich sehr lustig denn wir waren ja alle f r das leichtwindrevier vor qingdao auf di t
4409245 man muss respekt davor haben dass sie als einzige frau in der tornadoflotte mitsegelt und ihre sache so gut macht ich w re sogar stolz auf sie wenn sie nicht meine freundin w re ihr gilt mein respekt

4409255 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4409256 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him

4409276 were hoping he will travel up later today for talks and a medical and we are very hopeful that we will sign him up
4409277 i would think it is unlikely that it will be done by saturday but we will make every effort
4409278 of all our targets justin was top of the list so its excellent to get the chance to open talks with him
4409279 hes got fantastic potential hes already a very good player an england under 21 international hes very well schooled and hes got a lot of premier league experience with both arsenal and sunderland
4409280 we had jeremie ali d re come from arsenal and we know in terms of his lifestyle he is a good professional
4409281 weve done plenty of research with managers and coaches that have worked with hoyte and everything came back very positive so that gives you renewed vigour to go and sign him

4409295 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4409296 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4409297 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4409298 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4409299 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4409300 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4409301 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4409302 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4409303 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4409304 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4409305 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4409306 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4409307 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4409308 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4409309 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4409310 nothing good in the world has been accomplished without passion
4409311 she is very fond of john and has thought he might be the one she finds him funny sexy and very talented plus he understands all the aspects of living in a fishbowl but in the final analysis she just got tired of his roving eye
4409312 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4409313 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country

4409315 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4409316 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4409317 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4409318 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4409319 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4409320 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4409321 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4409322 just so you all know we did set a record
4409323 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4409324 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4409325 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4409326 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4409327 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4409328 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4409329 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4409330 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4409331 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4409332 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4409333 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4409334 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4409335 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4409336 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4409337 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4409338 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4409339 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
4409340 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
4409341 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
4409342 for climate changes he glosses over that this local planetary system is in constant change and we cant accurately measure the recent relatively small changes and anthropogenic contributions are an open question
4409343 how would the developers in this audience feel if the news media were opining on the benefits of one programming language over another and other people with no knowledge of programming were making strong statements based on what theyd read or heard in the media
4409344 im curious robert whether you are also skeptical about evolution that would be a good litmus test of whether this is a political religious disagreement or a scientific one
4409345 right now your choices are between the scientists who are actually conducting the research and analysis and pundits who are opining on something that they have no data research or proper science to support
4409346 most scientists think that global warming is an issue i think its bunk
4409347 there no agreement among scientists that weather patterns are changing as a result of human activity
4409348 look they are saying there may be the equivalent of war crimes trials one day
4409349 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4409350 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4409351 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4409352 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4409353 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4409354 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4409355 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4409356 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4409357 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4409358 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4409359 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4409360 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4409361 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4409362 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4409363 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4409364 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4409365 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4409366 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4409367 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4409368 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4409369 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4409370 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4409371 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4409372 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4409373 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4409374 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4409375 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4409376 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4409377 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4409378 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4409379 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4409380 der erste spieltag hat zumindest den vorteil dass es kaum interessant ist ob man ausw rts oder zu hause antritt
4409381 and i aint no preacher but heres my erick sermon

4409455 what most people dont know about osteoporosis is that it originates in childhood
4409456 your childrens best chance of avoiding the disease later in life is based largely on what you feed them and the amount and type of exercise you make sure they get
4409457 you can be lactose intolerant and still get plenty of calcium in your diet
4409458 sunlight is the ideal source for vitamin d and only 20 to 30 minutes a day during non peak intensity hours is usually sufficient
4409459 im concerned that we may one day have an epidemic of osteoporosis
4409460 by the time women hit 30 they stop building bone
4409461 so its important that women over 30 are getting enough calcium vitamin d and exercise so they can maintain and strengthen their bones because after menopause they can lose as much as five to 10 percent of their bone mass due to the lack of estrogen
4409462 dont wait for a symptom to tip you off that there may be a problem
4409463 there arent very many warning signals until the damage is already done
4409464 one out of every two women over the age of 50 will experience a fracture related to osteoporosis

4409478 so if you want to see what facebook looked like about three years ago you can go there at the time it literally was just facebook copied in red
4409479 now that facebook despite trying hard has not been successful in the german market the company seeks to obstruct studivz through court action their strategy appears to be if you cant beat them sue them
4409480 the first difficulty they run into is studivz is in germany
4409481 so facebook has sued them here on the theory that by logging in to the facebook site they agreed to be subject to suit in california
4409482 because it lets the person who executes the idea best win in the marketplace and that protects a healthy competitive marketplace
4409483 it may look like an easy thing to do but actually growing such a copycat is just as hard as building a company thats otherwise your own original idea

4409502 lao youth have a thai culture they watch thai television programs

4409508 a dis obedient child in school reflects poorly on the upbring ing by his father

4409525 i was there briefly i liked everything about it its so modern the stores have so much choice compared to ours theyre crammed with all kinds of goodies but i dont know i wondered where it would end you get a rice cooker and you lust for an oven you get an oven and you want a chef to come and cook for you once you get into that cycle you can never be satisfied
4409526 i appreciate things more and i dont have nothing i have friends i have a reasonably good life a socially responsible job experiences i mean how many people get to hang out with a legend of the underground movement

4409538 right but it was you who remembered the nurses and the photographs it wouldnt have entered my head
4409539 yes it would and it probably wont help anyway when the prints come back from the shop tomorrow all well see is smiling nurses and flowers not a bomber in sight hes hardly likely to pose with them is he now
4409540 so little faith in one so young remember anythings possible
4409541 there must be more we can do if only we could get access to the army bomb squad report or the police investigations im sure we could do more than the boy wonders

4409598 when you go from extreme high water to low water that has a tendency to leave behind significant sediment and it shifts channels unexpectedly
4409599 when you have a flood you get a combination of sediment and soil coming off the farm fields and golf courses and streets and yards
4409600 also the energy from the flow picks up sand off the bottom of the river it swirls it all together in this milky hazy mixture that comes down the river during flooding
4409601 nibc continues to benefit from its strong capital position in these turbulent markets this is reflected in our further improved core tier 1 ratio our second quarter results underline our business strategy to focus on what we do best for our clients building on our expertise and reputation we arranged important transactions in our home markets served as merchant bank to mid cap clients and provided specialised financing in clearly defined areas as part of our funding diversification strategy we recently signed our covered bond programme we have a strong platform for further growth but markets are likely to remain challenging

4409609 you you used to truss me up and steam me when i was just a baby how could you
4409610 if i may be so bold there was another president
4409611 at one time there was a president named ronald reagan who spoke very strongly about americas advocacy for democracy and freedom
4409612 there were many times i didnt pray for another day and i didnt pray for another hour i prayed for another minute to keep going
4409613 theres no doubt that my faith was strengthened and reinforced and tested because sometimes you have a tendency to say why am i here
4409614 we knew we had to have some belief greater than ourselves
4409615 we decided we needed to be all on the same sheet of music at least one time during the week
4409616 yea though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death we will fear no evil
4409617 we agreed that we were going to have a church service and told the vietnamese and they said no
4409618 the vietnamese broke in and seized the people who were standing against the wall doing the service
4409619 we wanted to actually just have a chance to do what we felt was a fundamental human right and we got spiritual comfort from being able to worship together
4409620 we thought look if were going to be together then were going to stand up theyd done so many bad things that we werent nearly as afraid of them as maybe we would have been if a lot of us hadnt gone through what wed gone through
4409621 render unto caesar what is caesars and render unto god what is gods
4409622 what i was trying to tell my fellow prisoners is that we were doing caesars work when we got into prison so we should ask for gods help to do the right thing and for us to get out of prison if it be gods will for us to do so
4409623 the god we had come to know wasnt going to wave a magic wand and poof we would all be free the god we knew would give us the strength to endure what we had to do and it was up to us to take that strength and knowledge and do what we had to do
4409624 i recall it as if it happened an hour ago
4409625 it was cold the guards were looking through the windows at us the room was dimly lit because of the light bulbs that were in each corner these guys had beautiful voices im telling you one was a bass one was a tenor it was one of the most beautiful experiences i ever had
4409626 it was because they were so happy to be able to celebrate christmas with fellow americans
4409627 i feel like i found my perfect fit shes taught me lessons about myself and i feel like ive taught her
4409628 i just kept saying this is too weird and leo was like oh get over it and im going yeah a little reminder youre my best friend hes my husband this is a bit weird

4409631 1 000 people came to russerts memorial service because essentially he was a shill for the government
4409632 the on air persona of an attentive and accommodating headwaiter
4409633 as a public official it was really first of all a treat to get on the show
4409634 he never treated politicians with the cynicism that attends some of these interviews so they had a place to be loved
4409635 he russert understood as well as anyone maybe better than almost anyone that the reason political reporters are there is not to speak truth to power but to make those who say we have the truth politicians explain it

4409638 er kleven wel wat nadelen aan de iphone zoals de vermeend slechte 3g ontvangst daardoor waren de kansen voor apple geslonken op gebruiksvriendelijkheid had de iphone wel gewonnen ik durf niet te zeggen welke telefoon smartphone van het jaar was geworden

4409655 the tnt is a perfect embodiment of that philosophy and shows that we can deliver it all from robust gear like the wild card from kyocera to less expensive devices that still excel at getting the job done with style

4409658 over the past month we have received and been supported by thoughts prayers and individual kindnesses from close friends family and even relative strangers it has in a word been amazing
4409659 it is a terrible thing to lose a child and it is truly a miracle to see a community indiscriminately pour out love and support in that childs memory
4409660 those who have stopped by we have hugged in person to everyone else who has held us in their thoughts and prayers we are filled with strength and courage by your support we are nourished by your kindnesses we are overwhelmed and eternally grateful for your love
4409661 theres no way jennifer and i would have made it through this without their help
4409662 pure energy and excitement always she had an amazing zest for life the last three months was the happiest id seen her
4409663 she was beyond cliques and her small group of friends were very sincere
4409664 is i found out things about her i didnt know
4409665 but taking over the offense that happens later right now im just trying to get into the groove get everything clicking and get everyone on the same page
4409666 the one thing you wonder about is the durability hes got to understand that 20 plays into 2004 ricky santos had to take somebodys place thats why backup kevin deckers got to feel like hes the starter and theres going to be competition
4409667 me and r j played together freshman year so im used to him
4409668 hes a very good quarterback so its easy for the receivers to adjust and its easy for r j to adjust were a tight team
4409669 it has all the makings of a real good line
4409670 were all trying to get the chemistry this camp so we can work well heading into the season
4409671 somewhere along the line out of those seven or eight guys weve got to get four guys who can start and others who can come in and play
4409672 were going to try to do what we did two years ago with dan wagner brendan st peter and marvin wright inside and on the outside trying to get three of them in a rotation
4409673 the opener is definitely going to fly by and be here before we know it
4409674 but the key is you cant look ahead 3 weeks youve got to focus on getting better and better day by day
4409675 tim needs to go at least six innings brad is a bull he pitched complete games all year for winnacunnet high school and he pitched a big one for us in the state tournament
4409676 if we pitch and play defense like we did in the state tournament well be ok itll depend on how deep our pitching goes
4409677 i need to have him play second base because im not going to dh him for tim or brad when theyre pitching
4409678 i am disappointed the federal government will not be assisting the many new hampshire families impacted by this severe weather and we will be asking that the decision not to include individual assistance be reviewed
4409679 the declaration fails to adequately address the damage inflicted by the tornado and fails to fully cover those impacted by this disaster which has only been worsened by subsequent rain and flooding
4409680 the severity and breadth of the disaster led gov lynch to request that all five impacted counties be declared disaster areas and that fema provide both public and individual assistance
4409681 ready to work with local state and federal officials in that effort
4409682 i havent seen my kids in 14 years its been awful
4409683 its to put some checks and balances into the court system
4409684 its very very easy for one parent to alienate another parent using the children
4409685 im fighting now for all the other people that are stuck in the system
4409686 theres nothing i can do for myself for my situation im fighting to change the system so that so many people who are currently caught in the system wont have to suffer like some many hundreds of thousands of others have
4409687 people are so financially destroyed theyve mortgaged their houses theyve emptied their 401ks
4409688 its extremely driven by money we need to start holding the judges accountable for their actions they have totally unlimited power they do whatever they want
4409689 and to prove yourself innocent takes a whole lot of money theres zero due process
4409690 go big and keep my board under me and stomp a landing

4409695 who knows but that on the lower frequencies i speak for you
4409696 i usually wear shoes with at least three to four inch heels
4409697 my father my brother and all the men in my family are over 6 feet so that is what i am used to
4409698 i am short and i am looking for a man to father my children and i dont want to have short children
4409699 i just feel safer when i walk down the street with a man who is much taller than me
4409700 i am only attracted to tall men i just cant help it
4409701 you realize that if you are talking about growing old with a man most people shrink a couple of inches as they hit old age
4409702 well if hes going to shrink all the more reason to only meet someone very tall
4409703 the lack of more substantive knowledge with respect to accounting and finance matters among past elected officials and the towns administrative staff was the root cause of the failure to recognize significant and in some cases serious deficiencies
4409704 it also appears that some of the auditors concerns were not shared with the entire select board
4409705 in my capacity as chair of the conservation commissions meeting of june 10 there has been a general perception that the conduct of a portion of the meeting and certain of my comments or questions concerning the affected boy scout were inappropriate
4409706 while these events were not my intent for these oversights i hereby publicly and sincerely apologize
4409707 in a manner which was not beneficial to all concerned
4409708 we really need to look at any way we can save energy
4409709 do something thoughtful and do it as part of the budget process
4409710 im sure that people will take advantage of this situation because of the gas prices
4409711 were going to be able to offer so many more services and i think that the townspeople will be happy about it
4409712 weve got a lot of good people in town and i want to offer them all that we can in our office and be able to keep that business in the town

4409719 he purchased the property back in 1979 and now they are celebrating their 30th anniversary
4409720 the mcginnis family would always come up and spend their summers at hampton beach
4409721 i think they held it from the casino restaurant which is now the whales tale
4409722 he and his family also represented hampton beach at the world fair in new york in 1964
4409723 they went into the barnstead town hall and the employees gave them a standing ovation
4409724 they monitor the building for us and give a proposal
4409725 i feel its a direction we should seriously investigate for the district
4409726 we went out to bid and got 12 5 cents for three months because the market is constantly changing
4409727 before december we feel we can get 10 cents or less
4409728 we did not lock in because the market is fluctuating

4409752 a lot of investors who have been buying commodities not just on a global growth story but as a hedge against a weak dollar are unloading those commodities based on a much more constrained global outlook and going back into the u s dollar
4409753 well have some people targeting 750 but i think we would need to see a continuation in that dollar strength to give it sufficient momentum to head that way
4409754 history shows a strong and consistent correlation between weak currencies and falling stock markets
4409755 weak currencies are a symptom of a deeper problem slowing economic growth out of control inflation or structural issues that reduce the attractiveness of equities

4409770 clearly the bank of england inflation report on wednesday triggered the latest round of selling this week and theres an increasingly probability that the boe could cut rates this year and will almost certainly continue to cut through 2009
4409771 we all knew 2 00 was wrong didnt we we just couldnt believe how long it hung around that level
4409772 i think one thing is now assured the dollar is now in a very strong up trend
4409773 we have our own dreams we are with europe but not of it we are linked but not compromised
4409774 i think intervention may make sense when prices start approaching realistic levels in irelands case that may take up to three years as excess housing inventories are sold off

4409776 as far as oil goes weve moved into a very new world and i dont think its right to take a view that the oil price can be sustainable at below 100
4409777 we may be lower for a bit but you should still expect oil hovering closer and hopefully remaining to 120 and perhaps we can begin to live with that

4409781 wed just started to nibble at the wheat theres been very little done round here
4409782 wed got about 120t of cordiale in store when we had a horrendous storm last thursday 2in of rain in an hour
4409783 because it was done immediately we only wrote off about 1 5t so what i thought might have been a complete disaster turned out pretty well
4409784 its done a good 10t ha although the protein was very low only 10 2 so it its only gone for feed but its bushel weight was among the highest weve ever had at 84kg ha
4409785 wed already stopped because of the expense of drying from 18 5 its just as well we had or might have lost quite a bit more but with the new combines higher capacity it does give us the chance to do more when things are a bit drier
4409786 weve got 4ha just to see how they do i havent grown peas for 20 years and im amazed at how tall they are
4409787 the day before my mazda four wheel drive pick up admittedly quite an old one was stolen from the farm they always say things like this always come in threes so i was waiting for the third
4409788 there will be no impact on farmgate milk prices the farmgate price that we offer remains one of the best in the industry this is simply a function of competition between retailers
4409789 weve just started to see some success in getting the consumer to understand the quality of milk and that producers must get a decent return from the market why do this to a valued food product why not to washing up liquid or toilet rolls
4409790 theres no contradiction here freshnlo complements our existing range were just answering customers call for us to help them with the pain of higher food prices it wont affect tescos farmgate milk price or its direct supply group
4409791 i challenge the statement that this will have no impact on dairy farmers and i dont believe this wont affect farmgate milk prices its also very interesting this product is in wisemans name i would also question where wiseman is going to get cheaper milk from to supply this range
4409792 our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs
4409793 this pay offer is an insult to professional hard working men and women who have to operate in extremely difficult conditions
4409794 this result is just the first to be declared with positive ballot results expected over the next few days at stansted and manchester airports
4409795 our members have had enough the liberalisation of ground handling services across uk airports has resulted in a race to the bottom which must and will stop
4409796 we will not stand back and allow labour costs to determine whether contracts are won or lost
4409797 hes the world record so really were just chasing him
4409798 for me in preliminaries to be a body length behind at the first 50 wasnt really where i wanted to be
4409799 so i have to try to fix a few things and i think to do that i have to conserve as much physical and emotional energy as i can im down to the last two races im just going to try to rest and recover as much as i can
4409800 ill start by not worrying about what everyone else thinks
4409801 no one knows what ive gone through in the past eight years to get here just me and a few people close to me it is my own personal deal at this point
4409802 hes been around weve seen him swim a long time
4409803 it would be good for the sport if he lost
4409804 lets be honest about that its true its good to lose sometimes i know because ive lost a lot for him what would it mean i would hope that he would cut down his events for the next year and start training more for the 100 fly theres no doubt in my mind thats hes the best will he be the best here i dont know hes got a lot on his plate hopefully that will work out for me
4409805 come on if you didnt look at the camera angle you would have seen that i was firing away from him and above him i was firing at my manager and mentor which is on the serbian team ive got nothing against michael phelps the guy is the king but do i want to make a rivalry of this sure why not but i have never disrespected anybody and im definitely not going to start with michael phelps thats crazy
4409806 it would be kind of nice that one day historically well speak of michael phelps maybe winning seven gold medals and having lost an opportunity to win eight gold medals
4409807 when they talk about that theyll talk about whoever that guy is that took it away from him id love to be that guy
4409808 jayson fouled it off and it hit him in the eye
4409809 hes in bad shape theres a lot of blood inside and outside of the eye
4409810 im really not in favor of a guy squaring around to hit the ball and a guy throwing it right at his head
4409811 its hard to get out of the way of that pitch
4409812 in my wildest imagination i didnt think they would throw right at his coconut
4409813 they said it was swelling with a lot of bleeding
4409814 no game of baseball is worth that as far as im concerned
4409815 i just dont like it played that way and me losing a player ive lost him probably for the rest of the series
4409816 in the format throwing at guys in that situation to defend the wheel i dont think its the place for it
4409817 ets europe was selected due to the strength of their worldwide experience in delivering large scale assessments
4409818 it is disappointing that the issues with this years national curriculum test results have meant that the partnership between qca and ets europe must end early
4409819 ets europe has apologised to schools for the delays in marking national curriculum assessments in england
4409820 as a subsidiary of a global non profit company we are dedicated to assuring quality and equity for all pupils and we are sorry that the results this summer were delayed for some schools
4409821 however we would argue that the quality of the marking is high due to the stringent new checks that we introduced this year
4409822 i feel extremely proud to be a chinese cheerleader and it is a special honor to perform with the spaniards in the international troupe
4409823 i dont think chinese audiences are that conservative anymore and their thinking about this kind of thing is already rather liberated
4409824 its quite normal to go to the beach and see most young women dressed this way
4409825 the chinese cheerleaders are all beautiful girls wearing fashionable bikinis and this is probably the first time theyve appeared in public in such highly revealing clothes
4409826 i heard that a couple of months back and i immediately let it bounce off my back
4409827 i respect her and her diving and she deserves a lot of credit as a diver and i dont really know her as a person
4409828 obviously i could do with a few more weeks training
4409829 but i am here and i think the fact that im here and im strong very strong actually will be an advantage for me in the race too
4409830 its just about going in and running the best race i can do control yourself and hopefully cope well with the conditions which are going to make it a very tough race
4409831 afterwards we may feel the effects really sore throats blocked noses the day after
4409832 if things go according to plan in the race ill take the suffering afterwards
4409833 the whole thing has just been the hardest thing that ive ever done coming through this
4409834 running outside is what i love doing its much easier to do that than it is to do the huge amounts of cross training looking at walls and not even being outside so certainly when it gets really tough in that race im going to be thinking about walls stuck in front of my face and thats going to be pushing me on
4409835 there were a lot of things going wrong and i almost felt like i was being tested to see if i wanted to be here strongly enough
4409836 it shows the world we can come back no matter what i gave my heart and soul out there its been a really long road and im proud to be here its easier than coming second to a different country
4409837 whether its me up there or nastia we are both wearing usa and it makes us both proud to see our colours and our country up there nastia deserved the gold
4409838 we both supported each other 100 percent and just wanted to go out there and give it our all and have fun because this is the games nothing is bigger or greater than this
4409839 in between events we look at each other and give a head nod it means so many words i was trying to encourage her and say come on without distracting her
4409840 its going to be a great motivational event for the young generation to come im so proud
4409841 this is absolutely incredible for the united states of america gymnastics theres more to come

4409849 you have to move on and you have to be prepared to forgive the past that affects you personally if it involves 2 000 acres and two billion ringgit its just not my right to forgive they have to return the money but otherwise we cannot afford to drag the entire country back to the past

4409855 we the stanford superstars selection panel believe this squad is very capable of doing justice to their selection to the stanford superstars squad to face england for the unprecedented purse
4409856 there are several familiar faces in this stanford superstars squad but there are some exciting new additions such as lindon james lionel baker and chad hampson
4409857 this does not change our evaluation of the security situation
4409858 i think it is a perfect illustration of the fact that high performance reliability and increase of pace can go hand in hand
4409859 a total car ban is imposed on karbala from today till the end of pilgrimage on sunday security forces were deployed on all entrances of the city to ensure total security during the commemoration of the birth of imam al mahdi

4409871 the proposed price does not reflect the strength of unionbancals strong capital position the superior credit quality of its assets and its potential for profitable asset and core deposit growth in the current market environment
4409872 the special committee believes any valuation of unionbancal should not be inappropriately impacted by these negative factors and the operating challenges facing many industry participants are creating opportunities for unionbancal
4409873 it is imperative particularly in more challenging financial conditions that firms have in place appropriate systems and controls to manage their risks

4409880 amnesty international is still seriously concerned about the ban on the wearing of headscarves in higher education in turkey it believes that this ban is discriminatory and disproportionate despite the amnesty proposed for students excluded from university the ban has and will continue to result in many people being excluded from university education and in the suspension or dismissal of hundreds of women from university teaching posts as a result of their religious beliefs amnesty international urges the turkish authorities to take steps to address this issue
4409881 harassment of women wearing the hijab islamic headscarf was routine throughout the 1990s but diminished in the early 2000s in recent years however the authorities have stepped up harassment of women wearing the hijab following statements by senior government figures the ministers of foreign affairs and of the interior and the secretary general of the ruling political party the constitutional democratic rally rassemblement constitutionnel d mocratique publicly criticised the increase in the use of the hijab by women and girls and beards and the qamis knee length shirts by men and called for strict implementation of a 1980s decree from the ministry of education banning women from wearing the hijab at educational institutions women especially have suffered in the enforcement of these policies some women are reported to have been ordered to remove their hijabs before being allowed into schools universities or workplaces some women have also reportedly been taken to police stations and required to sign statements that they would no longer wear the hijab others have reportedly had their hijab stripped off them in the street by police officers in plain clothes

4409885 the rs 1 334 crore hogenakkal project will be implemented as scheduled
4409886 i am happy that the happenings in j k and especially the amarnath controversy found a place in the prime ministers speech but i would have been happier if a resolution had been expressed to do something about the disgrace that has befallen our country
4409887 flying kites is like an independence day ritual two three days preceding this day my friends and i even my father brother sister and other relatives go on a kite buying spree and we couldnt have asked for a better weather than this to enjoy ourselves
4409888 we even have competitions to see whose kite flies the highest
4409889 my son who is just four is fascinated with these bright colourful things flying in the sky to add to his excitement i bought various kites in the shape of cartoon carachters like spiderman and batman
4409890 strictly indian traditional attire indian food and only hindi patriotic songs from the classic bollywood movies since its an i day themed dinner party the get together will be dotted with tri coloured flavours
4409891 i appeal to all political parties to keep the long term interests of jammu and kashmir in view and come together to find a permanent solution to the problems of the state the sacred shrine of shri amar nath inspires all indians to march together this shrine is a shining example of our secular tradition where hindu pilgrims have been looked after for years by their muslim brothers
4409892 issues related to this sacred place especially the issue of providing the best possible facilities to pilgrims can only be resolved in an atmosphere of peace and goodwill dividing people in the name of religion can complicate these issues further which can also pose a threat to the unity and integrity of the country
4409893 it is my conviction that all issues can be resolved only through dialogue and peaceful means
4409894 we are investing in infrastructure and in education in these regions to encourage development and generate employment jammu and kashmir and the north eastern region require an era of peace for them to catch up with the more developed parts of the country we have been taking various initiatives to promote peace and stability in these states these initiatives will be taken forward
4409895 i want to make sure that if and when we do it its really good its perfect
4409896 itll be very limited i want to make sure and im not quite certain yet but we should have answers very shortly
4409897 weve spent a lot of time doing a lot of wiring of ballparks doing a lot of checking
4409898 theyre trying obviously to get instant replay before the season ends
4409899 were having some discussions its coming at some point its more a question of when and how than whether
4409900 every game i watch theres a bat splintered im sensitive about it and we need to move ahead
4409901 i thought we had forever solved the problem and we had everything we did worked but we may put an additional safeguard in
4409902 at this time of the year every win is huge no matter who you play
4409903 weve not been able to take advantage of teams under 500 this time we really approached them the same way we approached the phillies and the teams in contention
4409904 that second time through the lineup it looked like they made adjustments
4409905 hes got the stuff weve seen it a couple times this year
4409906 thats the way it was tonight he was just executing pitch after pitch hes locating his fastball really well his slider was outstanding
4409907 kuroda was mixing it up throwing sliders and curveballs mixed his fastball in and changed speeds on his fastball trying to keep hitters off balance
4409908 its tough man weve been just in an offensive lull everybodys going out there and trying ive never really been a part of anything like it before
4409909 myers definitely was up to the task but their pitcher was good too
4409910 were all right i mean were a game back if you had asked me if i would take being a game back with 41 to play i would have said yes so theres no sense in us getting all bent out of shape
4409911 i didnt think about the streak until i started walking back on the mound
4409912 the first thought that popped in my head was i cant believe that just happened with a runner on first but i guess the good thing it wasnt a cheap one a whole bunch of things fell at once and so that way theres no pressure from this point on
4409913 carlos is a hit magnet the way he hits he stands over the plate
4409914 if carlos gets hit the way he gets hit i dont mind that but if he gets hit the way i dont think he should get hit then its a problem
4409915 its almost been like a no hitter type streak or something
4409916 unbelievable what hes done but ill get him right back out and try to start another one hes been tremendous
4409917 this type of win is whats been happening since early in the season when we started win a lot of games late
4409918 weve got our confidence up and we believe as long as we go on that field weve got a chance to win
4409919 i made the play and i never felt anything pop
4409920 if i had to go through this i could at least be an example of trying to live out whats right trying to stand strong and trying to just keep my faith intact
4409921 we gave the truth to the jury we are happy we had an opportunity to try our case
4409922 this lawsuit in my opinion should not have been filed because nothing happened
4409923 its a great vindication and shows us the faithfulness of god
4409924 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4409925 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4409926 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4409927 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4409928 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4409929 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state

4409934 the idea is to let them assimilate without all the chaos
4409935 starting high school is an overwhelming situation and for the freshmen coming through the doors it can be intimidating we began the delayed opening several years ago so that the students coming through the door for the first time can have some time to themselves to get their bearings its worked out well in past years and were glad to be able to continue doing it i feel it really does help alleviate a lot of anxiety and confusion and its a great way to help make the students more comfortable
4409936 it can be difficult for these students to go from being the oldest and wisest pupils in their school to being the youngest and newest
4409937 so weve found that by delaying the rest of the students a few hours makes a big difference in how the incoming freshmen assimilate themselves
4409938 there are 15 circles on the map and every circle has a clue
4409939 the clues will help you find the key to the treasure chest
4409940 that you cant go and cut down any old tree without a hearing
4409941 i try to eat right but its hard with all the junk food sometimes i do cardio and weight lifting with my mom
4409942 i worked at a weight loss camp in california 11 years ago and absolutely loved it
4409943 as a fitness instructor i dont tell anyone to deprive themselves
4409944 its a great exercise and keeps you healthy i know im going to be strong when i grow up
4409945 healthy food is good for you but you can have a little junk food just a teensy bit
4409946 me and my sister really wanted to go to fitness camp i learned that fruit and vegetables are good for you and i learned to draw a cherry tree
4409947 they sit down all the time when i was a kid i was outside all the time
4409948 its important to learn early on an active healthy lifestyle
4409949 we color food pyramids we do kid anatomy and self esteem activities
4409950 i heard there could be grants out there but i dont know yet if its going to be feasible for a property of that size
4409951 this is probably something that is going to go before the voters at the 2009 town meeting
4409952 my hopes for the season are to qualify for the ncaa or ecac tournaments
4409953 we had a strong season last year and want to improve
4409954 the small school provides a close knit family for me which made my transition from home very easy i am fortunate that i get to play with some of the most talented soccer players and genuinely amazing people that ive ever met
4409955 the biggest difference that ive experienced from high school to college soccer is the quality of players and teams in high school it was possible to not play at your best for a game and it wouldnt be that big of a deal but with the teams we play now if you have a rough game you can have an unfavorable result
4409956 our team had dedicated our last season and the upcoming one to corey worsham
4409957 we spent hundreds of games playing together on various raymond teams as well as an olympic development program team
4409958 but taking over the offense that happens later right now im just trying to get into the groove get everything clicking and get everyone on the same page
4409959 the one thing you wonder about is the durability hes got to understand that 20 plays into 2004 ricky santos had to take somebodys place thats why backup kevin deckers got to feel like hes the starter and theres going to be competition
4409960 me and r j played together freshman year so im used to him
4409961 hes a very good quarterback so its easy for the receivers to adjust and its easy for r j to adjust were a tight team
4409962 it has all the makings of a real good line
4409963 were all trying to get the chemistry this camp so we can work well heading into the season
4409964 somewhere along the line out of those seven or eight guys weve got to get four guys who can start and others who can come in and play
4409965 were going to try to do what we did two years ago with dan wagner brendan st peter and marvin wright inside and on the outside trying to get three of them in a rotation
4409966 the opener is definitely going to fly by and be here before we know it
4409967 but the key is you cant look ahead 3 weeks youve got to focus on getting better and better day by day
4409968 i am disappointed the federal government will not be assisting the many new hampshire families impacted by this severe weather and we will be asking that the decision not to include individual assistance be reviewed
4409969 the declaration fails to adequately address the damage inflicted by the tornado and fails to fully cover those impacted by this disaster which has only been worsened by subsequent rain and flooding
4409970 the severity and breadth of the disaster led gov lynch to request that all five impacted counties be declared disaster areas and that fema provide both public and individual assistance
4409971 ready to work with local state and federal officials in that effort
4409972 i was playing indoor and outdoor soccer recreationally i had had a baby a couple of years earlier but i was looking for something else to do
4409973 a friend of mine had done the timberman and said she had a horrible experience in the swim for me that made it sound exciting and challenging during the swim youre getting kicked and punched and people are swimming over you
4409974 in december of 2006 i bought a bike and joined a triathlon club in north andover mass called tri fury i did six last year all sprints and one duathlon biking and running this year i will have done eight by the time the year is over
4409975 maybe before im 50 im 44 now maybe as a 50th birthday present to myself
4409976 last year i did pretty well considering i just started every race i map out how much time i want to knock off and what point in positioning realistically i want to be in obviously i would love to go one two three
4409977 ive done very well and hired a coach working with sharon johnson out of the north andover ymca
4409978 im in better physical condition than i have ever been but it takes lot of a sacrifice and to do it competitively takes even more
4409979 i had my first daughter and i went in for a physical i had high blood pressure and high cholesterol so i got myself on a treadmill
4409980 my in laws approached me with the idea of doing the timberman
4409981 a lot of them do it i signed up not having any idea if i would be able to finish i was 273 pounds and went down to 202
4409982 i had never done these kinds of things before as a kid i never had any interest in them but there was the challenge of doing something new and the excitement of going further and faster
4409983 the other big part is that now when i go out training the kids abigail age 2 and allison age 4 they pretend how they will do it someday so its a positive influence
4409984 ive met a lot of nice people through the online community and at races
4409985 i started in 2005 and to this point ive only done one a year the timberman it wasnt until this year that i gained the confidence to do more next year more like to the moose man which is olympic length
4409986 this is something i can do and still have a life
4409987 an hour or hour and a half a day of training still gives you time for a life
4409988 i usually wear shoes with at least three to four inch heels
4409989 my father my brother and all the men in my family are over 6 feet so that is what i am used to
4409990 i am short and i am looking for a man to father my children and i dont want to have short children
4409991 i just feel safer when i walk down the street with a man who is much taller than me
4409992 i am only attracted to tall men i just cant help it
4409993 you realize that if you are talking about growing old with a man most people shrink a couple of inches as they hit old age
4409994 well if hes going to shrink all the more reason to only meet someone very tall
4409995 to se bo zgodilo e ne bomo ni esar storili

4409998 it was a very tragic accident and a tremendous loss for the community
