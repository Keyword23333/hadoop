6440009 well pitch him when hes ready to pitch and not because his day comes up
6440010 the point is that beckett is really wanting to throw and thats always a good sign
6440011 but the one thing we dont want to do is rush him back
6440012 maybe this concert can inspire a whole new generation of chemists

6440025 we are looking for girls with a great attitude a pretty face and the endurance to sweat off the pounds during a 3 month boot camp style show
6440026 anything more than 25 pounds in 12 weeks is really over stepping the boundaries
6440027 you can get very caught up in these shows especially young girls who are still building their self esteem
6440028 its very difficult and crushing to have someone look at you and say youre very pretty but youd be beautiful if you were 30 pounds lighter
6440029 the fact of the matter is at a certain point when government has not been serving the people for this long people get cynical they tune out
6440030 and they start saying to themselves a plague on both your houses they are willing to consume negative information more frequently than positive information for good reason theyve seen how promises havent been kept

6440045 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6440046 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6440047 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6440048 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6440049 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6440050 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6440051 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6440052 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6440053 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6440054 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6440055 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6440056 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6440057 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6440058 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6440059 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6440060 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6440061 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6440062 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6440063 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6440064 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6440065 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6440066 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6440067 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6440068 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6440069 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6440070 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6440071 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510

6440075 were going to have to cut more or were going to have to tighten our belts even more so tougher decisions are going to have to be made
6440076 there has to be some give somewhere in order to do that and thats an ongoing conversation
6440077 ive never worked for a government or public entity that explicitly put money for raises in the budget
6440078 that would certainly be my fantasy i dont know that that is going to happen
6440079 thats what we would like to see happen now we have to work with the pft and the other unions to see if we can make that happen
6440080 we want to do a financial plan that strategically looks over five years and includes costs for raises but that cant happen unless we look at some of this give and take
6440081 when asked about an hbcu she had no knowledge of what it was this is a major problem when 75 percent of graduating classes attend hbcus
6440082 i need to talk to the principal to see if it was a personnel issue or a fiscal issue
6440083 dr pitre will be in charge of all the academic functions of the school system that support regions schools and classrooms
6440084 i think he would be aborting his own campaign because that is such a critical issue to so many republican voters and the republican brand is already in trouble
6440085 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6440086 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6440087 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6440088 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6440089 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6440090 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6440091 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6440092 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

6440096 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba

6440098 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6440099 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6440100 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6440101 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6440102 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6440103 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6440104 were actually projecting this year that the north pole may be free of ice for the first time in history
6440105 this probably comes as no surprise given grain prices that farmland value was up fairly sharply
6440106 this was the second year in a row that weve had double digit increases in farmland values in the state of indiana
6440107 as far as cash rents this is the strongest increase weve had since the early 1970s when we had the demand shock of exports booming and prices going up
6440108 cash rent averaged 194 an acre for top quality land 157 an acre for average quality land and 123 an acre for poor quality land
6440109 interest rates are still quite moderate relative to their historical levels and so if one has to borrow money to make a land purchase that can be done fairly inexpensively now
6440110 another important factor is the supply of farmland thats available for sale
6440111 there is just not an abundance of farmland on the market at this point in time and if you are going to make a purchase youve got to convince somebody else to let go and that takes a fairly high price
6440112 given where interest rates are and the inflation outlook it seems more likely that interest rates will increase rather than decrease
6440113 by using a fixed rate loan you can lock in an interest rate at a fairly low level now
6440114 while weve had somewhat of a downward turn in corn and soybean prices we are still substantially above where we were a few years ago
6440115 the return side still looks fairly strong and interest rates look like they are going to be quite favorable which means things seem to be in place for positive upward movement in farmland value in the future
6440116 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6440117 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6440118 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6440119 the barack obama and john mccain campaigns have agreed to hold three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate in september and october sponsored by the commission on presidential debates the campaigns have come to the earliest agreement on presidential debates reached in any general election in recent history this announcement reflects the presidential campaigns agreement on dates locations and the formats for the fall debates campaign appointed debate negotiators house democratic caucus chairman rahm emanuel d il and senator lindsey graham r sc said they were pleased to have reached an early agreement to provide the american people with the opportunity to see and hear the candidates debate the critical issues facing the country the two campaigns have accepted sponsorship of the debates by the commission on presidential debates subject to the debates being conducted under the terms of their agreement
6440120 although consumers continued to face a great deal of economic pressure during the second quarter we believe their use of the government stimulus checks did provide a short term boost in our sales we were able to increase the average realized price for our footwear particularly within our adult and childrens athletic categories this price increase resulted in the second consecutive quarter of an increase in athletic footwear sales in comparable stores our second quarter performance continued to reflect strong inventory management and effective expense control our merchants reduced year over year inventory on a per store basis by approximately 7 0 percent and actually improved merchandise margins despite a 1 0 percent decrease in comparable store sales we were able to leverage our selling general and administrative expenses by 0 2 percent
6440121 i have no control i have to comply with anything they choose to do and i have no voice in the matter
6440122 id be giving up a months income to get that done thats the only thing thats keeping me on ebay the inconvenience of leaving
6440123 i talk to other people who have done what i did and theyre happy with their decision theyve been able to get their business to the ebay business levels or beyond
6440124 the gop republican party of today bears no resemblance to lincoln teddy roosevelt or eisenhowers party or many of the other republican administrations that came after that
6440125 my decision came at the end of last week when it was demonstrated to the nation that mccain and this bush white house have learned little in the last five years
6440126 they mishandled what became a crisis in the caucuses and this has undermined us national security
6440127 president eisenhower and his family are widely respected especially among the us military community
6440128 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6440129 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6440130 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6440131 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6440132 it provides a once in a generation opportunity to ensure that canadian research hospitals remain at the forefront of health research in the highly competitive international research environment
6440133 in addition opportunities for commercial and economic benefit include the development of novel therapeutic drugs based on unique genetic discoveries job creation and development of a skilled labour force
6440134 hey sheila hows it going im organizing an alumni trip to nyc this fall are you interested btw i lost your email so email me
6440135 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6440136 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6440137 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6440138 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6440139 they made his sister and two little girls watch them as they executed the three men
6440140 we know he and his buddy had nothing to do with drugs two innocent lives were taken its unbelievable and pretty upsetting
6440141 it boils down to being at the wrong place wrong time
6440142 ive know rene since he was little he was an awesome rider
6440143 its shocking to know that just by relation everything its over
6440144 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6440145 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6440146 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6440147 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6440148 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6440149 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6440150 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6440151 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6440152 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
6440153 oh by the way did you notice that the emperors got no clothes on
6440154 we have a subprime financial system not a subprime mortgage market
6440155 the uk housing event is probably second only to the japanese 1990 land bubble in the real estate bubble hall of fame uk house prices could easily decline 50 from the peak and at that level they would still be higher than they were in 1997 as a multiple of income
6440156 if prices go all the way back to trend and history says that is extremely likely then the uk financial system will need some serious bail outs and the global ripples will be substantial
6440157 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6440158 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

6440163 the large number of children coming into contact with the legal system mostly as a result of abuse cases has motivated intense scientific effort to understand childrens true and false reports
6440164 arguably even more important however are adults abilities to evaluate childrens reports
6440165 while accurately detecting false reports protects innocent people from false allegations the failure to detect false denials could mean that adults fail to protect children who falsely deny actual victimization
6440166 wheel clamping on private land has been a major problem for some years the governments view is that owners of land must be able to take action against those who park without permission and that wheel clamping may be an effective way of dealing with such situations but that any action must be carried out in a reasonable manner
6440167 there are many worthwhile and value adding improvements which will make properties more attractive to the buyer and generate the market value of the property
6440168 in the current market homeowners can inject value into their homes by undertaking the right home improvements carrying out work on your home can be rewarding but costly to correct if not executed properly where appropriate consult the professionals and seek any necessary planning permission before getting started
6440169 the summer often brings out the diy enthusiast in all of us but it is important to remember to take safety precautions when undertaking home improvement jobs however small they may seem a simple drilling job could turn into an extremely expensive claim if electrical wiring for example is not taken into account
6440170 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6440171 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6440172 the data reveal a remarkable resilience of the smb advertising segment in the face of economic pressures on local consumers and businesses
6440173 there were some hopeful signs in last quarters survey suggesting that the economy might be bottoming out but weakness persists across the board

6440194 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6440195 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6440196 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6440197 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package

6440201 for on his head are many crowns and the nailprints in his hands and feet are the scars of a great victory before him all my sorrow is melting away into deathless love and gladness and i give myself to him forever
6440202 but i see him as the king of sorrow and the crown on his head is a crown of thorns and the nailprints in his hands and feet are the scars of a great agony i too give myself to him forever for sorrow with him must be sweeter than any joy that i have known
6440203 when i was a kid yeah i absolutely wanted one
6440204 never did get it too expensive and that was that but now it looks like im getting a second chance
6440205 that has appeal from a personal point of view of course
6440206 but also it lets you do things that you wouldnt be able to do otherwise you can dare to be a little bit bolder and fly a little closer to the action and if something were to happen to it of course its a shame but its not tragic
6440207 theres a huge difference in size the auroras over 100 feet long and fully loaded weighs about 70 tonnes
6440208 the new unmanned aerial vehicle is more the size of a cessna or something along those lines its pretty tiny
6440209 since then ive been flying a desk at wing ops
6440210 if i got into a plane id certainly feel rusty
6440211 i think the unmanned aerial vehicle world may be different enough from flying manned aircraft that i wont notice the rust so much
6440212 i hope well be able to help out the army because thats really what the scope of the mission is all about
6440213 you get the view of whats going on on the ground so its possible to see things that wouldnt be seen from ground level because of obstacles and hills
6440214 that will give us a chance to not only operate the vehicle in flight but also to co operate with the army because thats the main thrust of the job
6440215 so with a few of them you could get round the clock coverage
6440216 there will also be one person from the intelligence section watching because they would be the experts on interpreting what you see

6440221 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6440222 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6440223 i will wear a black armband and i will talk with the drivers tomorrow maybe we can do something before starting maybe one minutes silence in the pit lane

6440258 our share repurchase program has proven to be an efficient method for returning capital to shareholders
6440259 given that we have nearly reached the prior authorization amount the board of directors determined that it was in the best interest of the company and our shareholders to expand the program this decision reflects the boards confidence in our financial strength and the ability to effectively manage our capital structure while continuing to execute our long term strategy

6440295 we have known for some time that young and middle aged adults who are overweight run a higher risk of death and it was presumed that this held true for older people in fact our results show that the risk of dying is higher only for the most severely obese but that all older people who are overweight are at significantly increased risk of developing problems with mobility and carrying out everyday tasks
6440296 this research is important because a growing proportion of the population is aged 65 or over and more and more of these older people are overweight in fact in most developed countries middle aged and elderly adults are more likely to be obese than people in any other age group these findings have huge significance for the delivery of health care both now and in the future increasing numbers of older people and higher levels of overweight and obesity will lead to a greater burden of disability and ill health and place an immense strain on health and social services the issue is likely to get worse as time goes on and represents a ticking time bomb for health services around the world
6440297 staying a healthy weight can be a fun and relatively easy thing to do even as people get older
6440298 our experience of running supported walking and cycling groups has shown that older people benefit in many ways from regular physical activity

6440304 while many americans are living paycheck to paycheck to effectively protect ourselves for the future we need to start saving paycheck to paycheck
6440305 our study shows that americans are better at saving money when they are thinking about it month to month on an ongoing basis rather than a long term goal
6440306 we plan on pay raises work bonuses and other monies to come forward but we cannot be thinking this way we need to start saving money every day
6440307 planning too far in advance not only makes consumers over optimistic regarding how much they will save but it also makes them behave in more aggressive and risk seeking ways in other financial arenas
6440308 the easiest thing to do is to be a smarter consumer and make spending and saving decisions thoughtfully on a daily basis that extra cup of coffee every morning carpooling with a co worker and cutting out the extras
6440309 the harder and more prudent thing to do is to mindfully take a portion of your earnings each pay period and save it in the bank
6440310 americans cant solely depend on their retirement plan it will be painful but like that mortgage or car loan payment we need to start thinking about a savings transfer every pay period

6440345 but saul who was also known as paul filled with the holy spirit fixed his gaze upon him and said you who are full of all deceit and fraud you son of the devil you enemy of all righteousness will you not cease to make crooked the straight ways of the lord
6440346 paul unmasks four characteristics of false teachers they are 1 deceitful 2 children of the devil 3 enemies of righteousness and 4 perverters of the gospel
6440347 even if we or a holy angel must be the object of gods righteous curse were any of us to preach a gospel contrary to the one we humans previously preached to you then all the more divine wrath must be poured out on those self appointed nobodies who are now making themselves guilty of this crime

6440359 sta es una condici n aceptable para vuelo es una pr ctica normal existe una lista de equipos m nimos que refleja esa situaci n

6440411 when a man receives hormone therapy initially the treatment works well and his psa prostate specific antigen level goes down
6440412 but inevitably the psa will start climbing again and that is usually the first sign that the treatment is beginning to fail its a sign that the cancer in the prostate is making a comeback
6440413 the androgen receptor acts differently in different cells in prostate tissue
6440414 its always been assumed that blocking the androgen receptor will stop all prostate cells from growing but we have found that thats not the case since current treatment acts non specifically on all the cells having androgen receptors in the prostate blocking the androgen receptor will give mixed results
6440415 while the androgen receptor is really driving prostate cancer in another sense it appears that the receptor also normally inhibits the spread of cancer cells it seems to have a dual role manipulating the androgen receptor can increase or decrease either of these actions depending on precisely how its done
6440416 the effects of the androgen receptor on hair growth in men vary dramatically depending on where in the body the receptor is working
6440417 when the receptor is very active in the mustache area more hair grows when its very active on the top of the skull toward the front hair falls out and men become bald and the hair on the back of the head is insensitive to the receptor the effects of hormones depend on the location
6440418 we found that the same is true within the cells of the prostate itself

6440449 multiple insights into the traditions for dealing with violent actors and the various national legal regimes under discussion resulted from the conference these insights will be fully addressed in the edited volume that will result from this event there were however some overarching issues that bear mentioning here a context matters in the international arena law and legal frameworks are to a great extent the product of the cultural environment from which they originate and they have evolved on different tracks over time in response to individual situations it is a difficult task to reconcile differences in legal systems with such divergent origins and underlying rationales even where interests are shared and common threats menace b remarkable continuity despite this variation in legal and moral traditions however there is remarkable consistency across borders regarding what is being done in domestic legislation to combat political violence broadly and terrorism in particular regardless of how a given provision was expressed or justified in a particular state or tradition acts of terrorism are outlawed on their own merits in all the nations examined at this conference and one might argue in virtually all jurisdictions able to make law and to make law binding c national vice transnational continuity vice universality this continuity however is difficult to translate into universally accepted rules when one leaves domestic settings and enters international ones in the transnational environment there is no authority that can make law or make law binding at least not in the sense that we understand sovereign state authority adherence to rules and norms is voluntary and understanding of what is lawful or not has no essentially common cultural basis d questions remain while there is considerable agreement that war and war like acts can and should be rule governed and that these rules can be agreed to and followed even in international settings like for example the law of armed conflict between states this conference demonstrated that questions still remain about whether a government can fight terrorism effectively if it or its people politically agree with the goals of groups that violate the rules that govern violence and whether the methods used to achieve goals can be separated from the cause from the goals themselves there are no definitive answers to these questions but they must be addressed in order to further international cooperation to confront terrorism

6440502 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6440503 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6440504 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6440505 the negotiators have taken this very very far but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6440506 obviously the american forces are here coalition forces are here at the invitation of the iraqi government
6440507 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people respects iraqs sovereignty
6440508 but the goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
6440509 that is the goal and that has been the goal from the beginning
6440510 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6440511 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6440512 really we are very very close to closing this agreement
6440513 and as we said from the beginning there is no hidden agenda here
6440514 but really we are redoubling our efforts to bring this to a successful conclusion
6440515 we as the sadr movement denounce this dubious visit and such timing we reaffirm our stance of rejecting the long term agreement we demand the iraqi government and on the highest levels not to sign this unjust agreement and we demand the withdrawal of the government as soon as possible

6440646 tom himself was born in czechoslovakia and he has long been impressed by our personal story of immigrants coming to a foreign place knowing nobody and creating a theater it is the perfect play to mark our 30th anniversary season

6440666 kevins had a niggle all pre season but hes looking to get back to 100 per cent fitness now
6440667 there are two schools of thought he might be a wee bit fatigued with the travel for saturday but equally another game under his belt brings him closer to starting games for us
6440668 thats what we want because hes 19 years of age he gets forward he scores goals he runs well with the ball he can pass the ball and you can see that enthusiasm that hes got for the game
6440669 i need a bit of pace in the team its something were short of
6440670 john utaka could give us a bit of pace and wide options for sure he can run quick
6440671 hes got to use that pace though thats the key
6440672 hes got to get the ball work hard try to use his pace at the right times and take people on at the right times that hasnt happened yet
6440673 hes got to put his game together a little bit more
6440674 johns always involved he is always in my thinking and could come in against united
6440675 against chelsea i just felt we would have been too open with him there so papa played
6440676 we couldnt have played two wingers out there we would have been ripped to pieces
6440677 as it was we were too open and got ripped to pieces anyway
6440678 as far as i am concerned all that stuff is paper talk
6440679 i have said it before i am happy at hearts and am looking forward to the new season under the new manager
6440680 im really looking forward to making my proper home debut
6440681 i know a lot of the bolton lads from last season but its all about newcastle for me now and im hoping we can win on saturday
6440682 it was a massive season for me last year and ill always think of going to bolton as a big turning point in my career
6440683 its why ill always have a nice feeling when i think of bolton because they gave me a chance
6440684 i played for bolton at newcastle last season and the atmosphere was just unbelievable because kevin keegan had just come back

6440689 pat ohara saw that a meath defender was going to trip him and with clever anticipation he hopped over the outstretched foot and kicked the ball to the net

6440692 i gather that 140 tibetans were killed although the figure needs to be confirmed
6440693 since the riots in march reliable witnesses have established that 400 people have been killed in the lhasa area alone if you consider the whole of tibet the number of victims is obviously higher
6440694 we know about disturbances in the kham region but we do not have any details or figures about injuries or deaths
6440695 nor do we have any exact dates for the disturbances
6440696 ten thousand people have been arrested since march we dont know where they are being held
6440697 the military presence in tibet is old but the frenzy of new construction in the amdo and kham regions makes me say that this colonisation by the army is designed to last
6440698 the position of the isi has always been ambiguous but they may have been more directly involved in actions in more recent months because of lack of supervision
6440699 there is a lot of pressure building up on pakistan to take full charge of the isi rightly or wrongly people from the outside think the isi is the source of all their problems a former pakistani diplomat tariq fatemi told the newspaper

6440701 veramente sorprendente come il presidente della confcommercio umbria parli dei continui aumenti del costo della vita e del calo dei consumi senza chiedersi minimamente quale sia leffetto devastante che tutto ci ha sui lavoratori dipendenti e sui pensionati
6440702 le materie prime costano meno di quanto registrato a inizio anno i prezzi dovrebbero diminuire
6440703 a favorire la crescita dei prezzi nellagroalimentare sono soprattutto le distorsioni e i troppi passaggi esistenti nel percorso dei prodotti dal campo alla tavola durante il quale i prezzi moltiplicano e i centesimi si trasformano in euro

6440710 across africa favorable views of china outnumber critical judgments by two to one or more in every country except south africa where opinion is divided the survey provides a trend only for nigeria where favorable attitudes toward china are sharply up rising 16 percentage points in just the past year from 59 to 75
6440711 across sub saharan africa chinas influence is seen as growing faster than americas and china is almost universally viewed as having a more beneficial impact on african countries than does the united states clear majorities say americas influence in their countries is generally good but the perception that china has a positive impact is far more widespread

6440761 its a real blow to the people that loved him
6440762 im just shocked the real effect of not having him around is going to just hit us more and more both personally and professionally
6440763 i cant think of a thing that i did that i loved that paul wasnt a part of its a horrible shock to me he was such a warm kind wonderful man he will be missed
6440764 he was supposed to do my makeup this morning so that we could catch up i think that the world just got a little less pretty
6440765 i have no doubt over the last eight weeks given some of the media articles we have suffered brand damage
6440766 that people read something and say this but a few days later they say well we understand that qantas has a great reputation
6440767 theres a perception now being created of a lot more problems with qantas than there is in reality
6440768 we undergo as an airline close to 150 audits a year
6440769 the vets who had a look at him were really surprised at how fast hed gone downhill
6440770 hes having difficulties breathing and his flippers were at an unnatural angle
6440771 their advice to us was hes not going to last much longer hes suffering and you should take action
6440772 theyll need to locate it first and the poor little guy could have passed away in the night
6440773 once they figure out whats happened theyll take it from there
6440774 its a really tragic result from an operation that people worked really really hard for
6440775 theres no way that the logistics of feeding that animal by hand or in an aquarium is going to work
6440776 there are too many difficulties with it and the animal first of all has to be convinced to eat out of a tube its got to get to an aquarium and then youve got to find a product for it to eat which you can supply for probably a year
6440777 so i think for humans to try and keep it alive is just going to end up as a disaster
6440778 get it into the vicinity of the other cow and calf and hopefully the cow would take on two calves which would be pretty unusual
6440779 there were four cookie cutter shark bites in it and that has most likely occurred while it was out in the open water its just another thing that compounds the whole problem
6440780 even if they are able to entice the calf out into open water it would face a higher predation pressure from sharks
6440781 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin
6440782 the key here is hes weakening hes losing the strength to get him fed and to a pod that will care for him
6440783 as of now there are no plans for me to be on the show
6440784 i hope it turns out to be a really great show just for my dads legacy i was originally a part of 90210 and it was something pretty phenomenal so i hope it turns out great
6440785 i know shannen probably doesnt share the feelings that i have for tori but i love tori like my sister
6440786 but so far we havent seen anything except for promises
6440787 the olympic womens 10 000 has not yet aired on either the east or the west coast yet you chose to post the news of shalanes bronze medal shame on you please either warn readers of the spoiler alert or refrain from posting until after the major broadcasts
6440788 why are you reporting results before they show them on tv youre ruining it for us
6440789 what do i have to do to get this cop to chase me kill his entire family
6440790 where the amp is the red shell i need a red shell
6440791 more and more people keep contacting us about getting involved in co housing communities theres an unquenchable thirst for this sort of thing
6440792 with the home we were living in before it would have been very difficult to do a lot of retro fitting to it or do things to make it more energy efficient
6440793 but here were moving to a place where other people have spent a lot of time thinking about these things and have made very good choices about the energy efficiency of the home and its environmental impact someone else has taken the time and effort and had the expertise to make those choices carefully and weve taken advantage of it by buying into it
6440794 this summer i can cool off my house by closing it up during the day i dont need any air con in the winter the amount of heat i have to use is really small because the insulation is tremendous its exciting to live that way
6440795 i think we have been environmentally conscious for a long time and have tried to be thoughtful about the way we live but thats the way a lot more people are now anyway
6440796 a lot of the basic concepts behind co housing are applicable to larger housing developments
6440797 some of the principles could be woven in to conventional developments things like having the residential area car free having a common house where you can eat communally from time to time hold events and have a childrens room and games room for teenagers
6440798 also having offices for home working means youre meeting government objectives about reducing carbon footprints and living more sustainably
6440799 the findings have convinced me to go ahead with the compulsory licenses since the ministrys policy is to give patients good access to quality drugs at cheap prices
6440800 dump that chump from doormat to diva in only nine steps a guide to getting over mr wrong
6440801 thanks but no thanks for the new underwear you bought me ma i am 34 you know
6440802 how about if we join her for chinese one sunday per month as opposed to every one
6440803 i get the sense that its hard for you to let your son really become his own person i wish you wouldnt feel like youre losing him to me but that youre just developing a new relationship with him that also includes me
6440804 you know that our countrys population is declining by an average of almost 700 000 people a year we have raised this issue on many occasions but have for the most part done very little to address it first we need to lower the death rate second we need an effective migration policy and third we need to increase the birth rate
6440805 we have to start well at valencia where its more important than in other places to drive with continuity from friday on
6440806 i hope ill have a trouble free weekend to try to set up the car the best way possible especially for the qualifying lap
6440807 the qualifying will be extremely important although i think that there are some possibilities on the track to overtake
6440808 like at montreal you also need a bit of luck and i hope that it will not end for me as it did in canada anyway theres no need to worry until we race
6440809 if its hot that will help ferrari we just have to fight until the end and try to win
6440810 we are confident that the failure we suffered in budapest was a one off
6440811 the candidate republicans should be clamoring for is the one liberals are most feverishly denouncing that is mitt romney by a landslide
6440812 were not going into the ad network business so to speak
6440813 we look at how we enable the existing players to have a better digital advertising opportunity
6440814 we want whats the best for caylee we want caylee found
6440815 its not about getting casey out to make sure she feels better
6440816 its all about the interest of finding caylee hopefully she will get us some information
6440817 i remembered how difficult it is opening a restaurant we had forgotten everything there was running very smoothly it was interesting to go back to ground zero
6440818 every time i go back there i feel so proud of splendido how fortunate we are to have that great restaurant
6440819 i had no direct knowledge and no direct participation in the recent care of the patients in question
6440820 patient confidentiality laws prevent me from discussing these or any other patients who may have been admitted to the facility
6440821 not a very good track record especially at an expensive hospital like that
6440822 they feel like they are the bigger kids of the little kids
6440823 a lot of them have not been in a school setting
6440824 theres going to be stories and playtime and time for lunch
6440825 what should you do if you need the go to the bathroom
6440826 what if nobody is playing with you at choice time
6440827 what should you do if you want to play with a toy another boy or girl is already playing with
6440828 who could help you find the cubby with your name on it
6440829 kids worry that because its new for them maybe mom and dad wont know what to do
6440830 im going to go home and clean house do a little grocery shopping and by then it will be time to pick you up
6440831 ill be working today at my office and thinking of you grandma will come and get you right here
6440832 encourage kids to do their best let them know you value what they do
6440833 explain that school is their work just like you have to go to work
6440834 on the first day of school the upperclassmen stay home
6440835 freshmen go through a shortened version of their classes learn where everything is and arent fumbling with their lockers in front of the upperclassmen
6440836 theyre very uncertain of themselves uncertain of where theyll fit in
6440837 no matter what happens they will be a special part of out family a part of the community
6440838 wherever they are in lifes process no matter what their interests are theres a place here for them
6440839 all of the new students feel nervous no matter what they look like on the outside
6440840 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
6440841 its about the issues that everyones talking about but theres a lot of hope
6440842 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6440843 there was healthy competition among artists to create art that was commercial and political at the same time
6440844 our music now is not representing the times at least not socially and politically or maybe were just distracted
6440845 these musicians speak to millions of people every day so for them to use their voices to inspire people is a key part of our program
6440846 if you can go quietly negative thats what hes done i think the perception is that hes still running the positive campaign
6440847 its a pretty smart high low good cop bad cop strategy

6440858 convening parliament is in violation of some of the things in an agreement he and mugabe signed last month that opened the way to power sharing talks
6440859 that while negotiations are continuing it may be necessary to convene parliament to give effect to the will of the people as expressed in the parliamentary elections
6440860 creative medium similar to photo or video but just a little bit different

6440876 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6440877 he was a tough negotiator but always reasonable and respectful with the ultimate goal of growing the game
6440878 there is a bit of newspaper speculation about what the allegations might be possibly involving a french women perhaps the posting of a video on a website
6440879 but that is not confirmed what we can say is that he does now face a hearing
6440880 my focus over the next 48 hours is to prepare my three boxers for their semi final bouts
6440881 the allegations made in the media about the conduct of athletes on the british boxing programme are on the whole unfounded
6440882 i feel extremely disillusioned that i have learnt of the suspension of one of my boxers from the media
6440883 above all though i am so sad that this together with the other allegations made have been raised to distract and unsettle me the coaching team and more importantly my boxers ahead of the most important bouts of their lives
6440884 the aba choosing to issue billy joe saunders with a suspension on wednesday relating to an incident which happened months before the olympic games is extremely disappointing
6440885 releasing such allegations to the media at this time could prove detrimental to the critical preparations of the other three boxers who will be contesting to reach the final of the boxing competition on friday
6440886 we are frustrated that our athletes and the boxing coaching team will have to deal with this added pressure and distraction at this point in the games
6440887 we took aggressive markdowns in the second quarter to drive customer traffic and achieve our goal of keeping inventory levels in line with the sales trends
6440888 rose to 27 cents from 26 cents boosted by fewer shares outstanding in the quarter
6440889 in the area covered by the simcoe muskoka district health unit nearly one in five 18 high school students grades 9 12 reported that they smoke daily or occasionally
6440890 74 of teen daily smokers reported that one or both parents also smoke the percentage of current smokers jumps significantly to 27 in grade 12
6440891 girls who smoke and have a weak version of a cancer neutralizing enzyme which millions of american women have see their risk for breast cancer skyrocket
6440892 the exact mechanism for smokings impact on the brains higher functions is still unclear but may involve both neurochemical effects and damage to the blood vessels that supply the brain
6440893 this is consistent with other findings that people with cardiovascular disease and lung disease tend to have reduced neurocognitive function
6440894 when i was a smoker i couldnt smell the stale smell on people who smoke
6440895 now im like god i used to smell like that
6440896 pick out more off flavors and hop aromas and the small flavors in beer
6440897 i definitely enjoy beer more now especially the lighter styles
6440898 now i can pick up the tiny flavors the lighter styles
6440899 ive really gravitated toward them too probably because i can taste them again
6440900 my ability to taste the beer is no longer corrupted
6440901 overall smokers took the most sick leave an average of 11 extra days or more than two weeks of full time work compared with non smokers
6440902 smokers tend to look older than non smokers of the same age smokers facial skin is more likely than non smokers to have wrinkles crows feet and a sallow yellow grey colouring smokers skin can be prematurely aged by between 10 and 20 years
6440903 among the people in the study who were current or former smokers they had smoked an average of about 24 years in all among participants who were 45 years or older the degree of skin aging was found to be significantly higher in smokers than nonsmokers in the 45 65 age group smokers had an average score on the photonumeric scale of more than two while nonsmokers had an average score of less than one in the 65 and older age group smokers had an average score of about six while nonsmokers had an average score of approximately four
6440904 your parents reference to smokers skin is presumably referring to the fact that constant exposure to smoke does cause skin problems particularly with regard to its elasticity this is why some seasoned smokers look older than their years the smoke particles can also block pores which could explain why your pores have changed appearance
6440905 smoking exerts such a noticeable effect on the skin that its often possible to detect whether or not a person is a smoker simply by looking at his or her face
6440906 smokers have more wrinkles and their skin tends to have a greyish pallor compared to non smokers
6440907 smoking tobacco activates this enzyme that breaks down the skin collagen
6440908 its ironic that teenagers often start smoking in the hope of appearing more mature but it probably never occurs to them by middle age they will really start to look older than their age
6440909 for smokers middle age starts in their early 30s as the tell tale wrinkles around the mouth and eyes begin to appear
6440910 young female smokers are likely to be wasting money on anti aging face creams if they continue to smoke
6440911 the best beauty treatment by far is to quit smoking

6441248 because today its so hard to imagine that this is where berlin started
6441249 weve not just found the houses where some of the oldest berliners lived but the residents too
6441250 we had hoped at the start of our dig to give berliners back a bit of their history but what we have found is the cradle of berlin
6441251 what report we have received is that there is an explosion in a house in wana
6441252 there are also casualties but we do not have any confirmation it is also not confirmed whether it was a missile
6441253 this has been a record number of people that have shown up to a cme weve conducted
6441254 this really shows the progress in this area people trust us and they come to us so we can help them with their needs
6441255 the mass violence in the country underscores the chilling fact that the most dangerous place in iraq is not the mosque the marketplace or the military checkpoint but the classroom
6441256 the photo actually a color xerox showed a pretty rather plump reddish haired iraqi woman smiling at the camera a santa claus cap perched on her head her name according to an inscription printed beneath her image was hadeel

6441261 convening parliament is a violation is a repudiation of some of the conditions
6441262 president mugabe will not proceed to do anything unilaterally that any step that we take has to be by consensus
6441263 if president mugabe proceeds to convene parliament appoint a new cabinet it means that he is proceeding to violate the conditions which means that he may have abandoned the basis for the talks but we dont know what his intentions are
6441264 that while negotiations are continuing it may be necessary to convene parliament to give effect to the will of the people as expressed in the parliamentary elections held
6441265 how do you share not only responsibility but also authority over government
6441266 how do you distinguish between head of state and head of government without necessarily defining anyone as ceremonial it is not envisaged that the president becomes ceremonial on the other hand it is not envisaged that you have got a ceremonial prime minister
6441267 it is that balance that is necessary to establish and i think thats where the outstanding issue is
6441268 the barack obama and john mccain campaigns have agreed to hold three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate in september and october sponsored by the commission on presidential debates the campaigns have come to the earliest agreement on presidential debates reached in any general election in recent history this announcement reflects the presidential campaigns agreement on dates locations and the formats for the fall debates
6441269 this is exactly the sort of thing programs like today tonight or a current affair gobble up expect to say mayor molony on your tv screen this week
6441270 here at sunbelt we understand the pain points administrators are faced with when using older av products
6441271 this upgrade program enables companies to address these issues of bloat and high resource usage by switching to vipre enterprise by eliminating the up front costs of a new license purchase we ease the frustration of being locked into an existing contract
6441272 spammertrap software also enables system administrators to decide which types of files should be quarantined by site or domain

6441279 wir stehen f r vielfalt in der landwirtschaft und auf dem teller
6441280 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6441281 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6441282 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6441283 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6441284 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6441285 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6441286 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6441287 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6441288 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6441289 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6441290 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6441291 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6441292 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6441293 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6441294 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6441295 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6441296 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6441297 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6441298 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6441299 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6441300 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6441301 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6441302 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6441303 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6441304 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6441305 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6441306 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6441307 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6441308 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6441309 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6441310 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6441311 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6441312 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6441313 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6441314 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6441315 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6441316 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6441317 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6441318 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6441319 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6441320 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6441321 this shit should have been sold out and on the mainstage
6441322 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6441323 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6441324 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6441325 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6441326 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6441327 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6441328 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6441329 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6441330 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6441331 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6441332 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6441333 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6441334 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6441335 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6441336 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6441337 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6441338 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6441339 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6441340 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6441341 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6441342 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6441343 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6441344 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6441345 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6441346 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6441347 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6441348 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6441349 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6441350 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6441351 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6441352 the original eight flavors orange lemon lime clove chocolate cinnamon licorice i think the brown is clove which makes me love them all the more ooooh come sit by us
6441353 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6441354 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6441355 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6441356 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6441357 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6441358 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6441359 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6441360 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6441361 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6441362 this is a planning took where all things are going
6441363 wir hatten dar ber schon mehrere beschwerden doch das w re eine preisfrage und daher nicht nderbar
6441364 aber der ist doch eh schon so teuer da kommt es doch auf die 2 f r einen druckknopf auch nicht drauf an
6441365 doch das w re eine preisfrage der kunde ist nicht bereit 2 mehr auszugeben
6441366 to jump to pre set features on xmb xrossmediabar such as
6441367 we are delighted to congratulate the reach scholars who earned high marks on rigorous college level exams
6441368 i would have thought for kids who were on the borderline that they would have seen an improvement
6441369 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6441370 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6441371 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6441372 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6441373 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6441374 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6441375 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6441376 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6441377 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6441378 to focus on the two things that matter in life making music and making wine
6441379 if you dont back up im placing this ten feet forward then
6441380 we couldnt work out the decision but unless we challenged it at court there was no way of resolving it
6441381 the amount we use is a drop in the ocean compared to people who are knowingly doing it illegally
6441382 how do you spell relief well i guess most of you would do it the old fashioned commercial way but the way i spell it is oh my god the third floor suite is done i hadnt realized until after wed finished it that uh itd been hanging over our heads for over five months so halle frikin lujah third floor suite is all done anybody else wishing to thank any other deity source is more than welcome i hope you all are enjoying your weekends i will enjoy mine much more now
6441383 kinda cool but in all probability highly useless in my future life
6441384 that cant possibly mean what it sounded like i dont think thats what she said

6441394 part of what id like to do is talk to the prime minister and see what still remains to be done what still needs to be closed
6441395 i think its a chance for me to sit with the prime minister and really get a sense of what if there is anything else that we need to do from washington to get to closure on the agreement
6441396 the negotiators have made really good progress they are satisfied with where they are
6441397 but obviously it is going to be the prime ministers call so this is a chance for me to sit there with him

6441414 it managers often worry that investments in training will be reaped by other organisations when it workers shop their new skills around
6441415 but this study indicates that investing in training is actually the best way to retain employees
6441416 while offering competitive salaries and benefit packages may be important for recruitment providing quality of life incentives and enhancing working environments are more important for retention

6441418 the annually laminated i e varved sediment record from the lower mystic lake near boston ma contains a series of anomalous graded beds deposited by strong flooding events that have affected the basin over the last millennium from the historic portion of the record 10 out of 11 of the most prominent graded beds correspond with years in which category 2 3 hurricanes are known to have struck the boston area thus we conclude that the graded beds represent deposition related to intense hurricane precipitation combined with wind driven vegetation disturbance that exposes fresh loose sediment the hurricane signal shows strong centennial scale variations in frequency with a period of increased activity between the 12th 16th centuries and decreased activity during the 11th and 17th 19th centuries these frequency changes are consistent with other paleoclimate indicators from the tropical north atlantic in particular sea surface temperature variations
6441419 the lml sedimentary record provides a well controlled and annually resolved record of category 2 3 hurricane activity in the boston area over the last millennium the hurricane signal shows centennial scale variations in frequency with a period of increased activity between the 12th 16th centuries and decreased activity during the 11th and 17th 19th centuries we recognize that the lml record is a single point source record representative for the greater boston area and hurricanes that passed a few hundred km to the east or west may not have produced the very heavy rainfall amounts and vegetation disturbance in the lake watershed necessary to produce a strong signal within the lml sediments nevertheless we also note that clear evidence of a secular change in hurricane frequency identified in the lml record is consistent with other lines of evidence that conditions for the development of hurricanes have changed on centennial timescales hence it appears that hurricane activity was more frequent in the first half of the last millennium when tropical atlantic ssts were warmer and eastern equatorial pacific ssts were cooler than in subsequent centuries

6441446 he supported that action even though many said it would hurt his campaign for president he didnt care about popularity he cared about success for our troops and our country and now that the surge has worked it proves that johns judgment was correct

6441465 theyll need to locate it first and the poor little guy could have passed away in the night
6441466 once they figure out whats happened theyll take it from there
6441467 its a really tragic result from an operation that people worked really really hard for
6441468 theres no way that the logistics of feeding that animal by hand or in an aquarium is going to work
6441469 there are too many difficulties with it and the animal first of all has to be convinced to eat out of a tube its got to get to an aquarium and then youve got to find a product for it to eat which you can supply for probably a year
6441470 so i think for humans to try and keep it alive is just going to end up as a disaster
6441471 get it into the vicinity of the other cow and calf and hopefully the cow would take on two calves which would be pretty unusual
6441472 there were four cookie cutter shark bites in it and that has most likely occurred while it was out in the open water its just another thing that compounds the whole problem
6441473 even if they are able to entice the calf out into open water it would face a higher predation pressure from sharks
6441474 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin
6441475 the key here is hes weakening hes losing the strength to get him fed and to a pod that will care for him

6441598 right now in a lab somewhere in the far east a worker is putting in 12 hour days making every effort possible to find the perfect polyester fiber that will substitute for your cotton
6441599 delivery of a quality product is essential otherwise you wont be in business
6441600 so the definition of value for your cotton is set by the foreign buyer
6441601 the rest of the world will gradually move away from hand harvesting but it will be a very slow process
6441602 once its bought and blended together the perception of the mills is that its all alike while we think in terms of bales the rest of the world thinks in terms of tons they get frustrated when they get cotton from the united states and color is all over the place and length varies widely we work hard to educate the international community on the u s cotton production system
6441603 and they complain bitterly about the quality of the cotton we deliver
6441604 so we have a big advantage there the no 1 controllable issue for american cotton is contamination wal mart bags bird nests tie downs etc
6441605 when american mills used 11 5 million bales of our cotton shipping logistics were pretty simple now cotton has to be at the port at a specific time for loading or it may miss its window
6441606 it seems every time we turn around theres a 400 to 600 increase for the typical 40 foot shipping container it costs 1 cent per pound to ship cotton from mumbai india to china it costs 7 cents per pound to ship from california to china thats a 6 cents per pound disadvantage for american cotton in shipping cost alone
6441607 its not just about fiber any more is it possible well one day grow cotton for its seed rather than fiber
6441608 this is my 10th year to report on the status of the program and its the best report ive ever given
6441609 we feel most of the weevils in that area migrated in from louisiana
6441610 essentially the boll weevil has been eradicated in our state and its a tribute to a lot of hard work and investment by everyone involved over the past 10 years
6441611 since no weevils were captured in that area last year we feel confident that it came in on equipment or vehicles
6441612 weve seen about a 46 percent decline in acres each year since 2006 and we hope that will soon turn around
6441613 hard work dedication and contributions to the success of the program
6441614 there were times in the early days when we were heavily in debt and often didnt know if we could function the next day
6441615 its a credit to our board members especially perthshire miss producer ginner kenneth hood who raised a lot of money to keep things going their hard work and cooperation has been a key factor in our success
6441616 the 2008 dr carver award finalists exemplified strong academic excellence this made it difficult to select a winner but with strong germplasm research with high oleic and disease resistance on soilborne diseases such as sclerotinia shannon stoup is this years recipient congratulations to our winner

6441618 corn prices had run up to a very high level because of midwest flooding early this year
6441619 since then weather conditions have been very favorable across the midwest and crop conditions have steadily improved through july and into august
6441620 corn prices and oil prices have been moving fairly closely for the last couple of years as oil has fallen sharply in the last month or so corn has gone down along with it
6441621 corn prices fell close to 3 in about six weeks this is about as dramatic a turnaround as you ever see
6441622 there certainly wont be a lot of profit in this crop because it was probably the most expensive corn crop anybody has ever grown because of the high cost of pumping water fertilizer and seed costs and rent on land for those who lease it
6441623 harvest is late because spring rainfall delayed planting and cool may temperatures slowed corn development recent substantial rainfall has slowed grain drying and muddied fields across all but the northernmost counties of mississippi
6441624 corn harvest should be in full swing when fields dry up in south and central mississippi
6441625 although we had a lot of wet conditions early this spring we quickly dried out and began irrigating most of the irrigated crop in early june and had to continue through late july and even early august in parts of the state
6441626 the rainfall we had early in the season will limit production somewhat because it inhibited root growth and expansion the crop was extremely dependent on supplemental irrigation and timely rainfall during the season
6441627 weve got a lot of corn planted on our very best soils the past two years it replaced cotton acreage in many places and much of this is irrigated
6441628 our dry land crop is in better condition than it has been in the last two to three years because we havent had as much drought stress
6441629 right now in a lab somewhere in the far east a worker is putting in 12 hour days making every effort possible to find the perfect polyester fiber that will substitute for your cotton

6441635 a highly qualified professional prosecutor who carried out his responsibilities as charged
6441636 handed a harsh sentence based in part on allegations never presented to the jury
6441637 argue correctly that our entire system of justice relies on people telling the truth
6441638 had mr libby only told the truth he would have never been indicted in the first place
6441639 both critics and defenders of this investigation have made important points
6441640 it is very terrible that freedom would be taken from a human being because of an opinion or belief of his but it is very beautiful that his detention would be an encouragement for him to stick by his principles and a reason for him to defy and hold on to what he thinks is right even if he violates the traditions and beliefs of the majority of the people within the boundaries of his society
6441641 all eyes are opened or opening to the rights of man the general spread of the light of science has already laid open to every view the palpable truth that the mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs nor a favoured few booted and spurred ready to ride them legitimately by the grace of god

6441658 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6441659 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style

6441679 i see fewer commercial cds these days again due to the greater popularity of the ipod and similar hardware players the commercial audio cd may not exactly be doomed but it is certainly under fire from the new media player technologies i dont see much use of the dvd as a sharing format the ipod strikes again but i have seen some excellent video productions on dvd from a few students i expect to do more with the format as both storage and playback medium but i doubt that it will gain significant ground against the portable players

6441721 the plaintiffs and their children suffer serious burdens by being excluded from civil marriage
6441722 identified 1049 federal laws in which benefits rights and privileges are contingent on marital status
6441723 moral disapproval of same sex couples or of individual homosexuals is not a legitimate state purpose or a rational reason for depriving plaintiffs of their right to choose their spouse
6441724 does not bar women who are past child bearing age to marry
6441725 millions of lesbian mothers residing with their children in the united states
6441726 neither the defendant nor friends of the court indicate how marriage would be diminished by allowing same sex couples to marry
6441727 nor how the marriages of opposite sex couples will be adversely affected by allowing same sex couples to marry
6441728 excluding same sex couples from marrying may in fact undermine the states interest in providing optimal environments for child rearing in that children of those families are then not afforded the same legal financial and health benefits that children of married couples receive
6441729 marriage must remain a heterosexual institution because that is what it historically has been

6441762 this current law is a law that is routinely evaded
6441763 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
6441764 underage and binge drinking is a problem and we welcome an honest discussion about how to address this challenge but that discussion must honor the science behind the 21 law which unequivocally shows that the 21 law has reduced drunk driving and underage and binge drinking
6441765 i am old enough to remember life on our campuses before the 21 year drinking rule it was horrible
6441766 i wish college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
6441767 not being so depressed that i just flat out cant function in life above a subsistence level

6441780 convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide
6441781 adopted by resolution 260 iii a of the united nations general assembly on 9 december 1948
6441782 the fact that mr saakashvili signed a modified version of the agreement and that attempts to get a un security council resolution signed have been torpedoed all of this indicates that it is not nato countries telling mr saakashvili what he should do to meet high nato standards its mr saakashvili telling developed democracies such as nato countries what they should do to satisfy his ambitions
6441783 and what i am saying now im going to say for the first time georgia is a civilised country but in its history there were times when it had to sell its children on the istanbul markets they were then taken to egypt and it was not only boys but girls too their mothers tried to convince them how sweet their lives would be there when the russians came they banned this slavery and i cant but say this that the russians actually saved georgia why is it that today america is the only country who has influence on georgian politics do they really need to put us at war with ossetia its logically not right it was our leaders decision to do all this aggression it was exclusively the decision of the georgian state and i believe we made a mistake a very serious mistake
6441784 convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide
6441785 adopted by resolution 260 iii a of the united nations general assembly on 9 december 1948
6441786 genocide is the deliberate and systematic destruction in whole or in part
6441787 i had no idea whether i was going to go four years or whether i was going to leave and the opportunity usa hockey gave me to go to the 1986 world championships gave me the opportunity to find where i was and who i was as a player and without that maybe i dont turn pro and maybe i stay four years at college and maybe i break my leg or blow my knee out or maybe i dont develop as much as i could have as a pro without that opportunity i dont know if i would have been an nhl player
6441788 when i looked at the possibility of playing hockey besides going to college it didnt appeal to me at all
6441789 i wasnt ready to be that far from home i wasnt ready to play that many games and i was looking for something with a comfort level so i feel fortunate that college hockey had gotten to a point where competition was great the practice facilities were good the coaching was good and that i could be prepared by playing a 35 game schedule
6441790 for me there was personally no other thought process in my head that i thought that college hockey was the best for me
6441791 it was such a blast to play hockey in college i only had two years there and it was a perfect step stone into the olympic team and onwards to the minors and pros
6441792 there were just so many good teams and so many good players across the nation and if i had a regret i wish i could have been able to play more years the timing is such that you move on when you should but the foundation in college hockey was fantastic
6441793 we all went there because its a great proving ground and improving ground to get to the next level so we owe a lot to the college game
6441794 with college for me i noticed playing on a college team and having all these rivalries with top players from other teams those players became my really good friends because i ended up playing on the national team with them
6441795 a lot of these girls that i met in the college game became my roommates for years as we trained for the olympics as we lived in the lake placid dorms together
6441796 thats the nice thing about the college game not only the teammates that you have playing but also the ones you play against
6441797 i think by my freshman year i skated with everyone on this phone call
6441798 i think its awfully fun being able to play against these guys and then be on a national team with them to kind of see both sides of them
6441799 there are those guys that kind of stand out in your mind when you play against them and sure enough theyre the ones that are going to be put on the national team
6441800 those are the people that are going to rise to the top and youre going to see again and again and again
6441801 if the devil wears prada were a reality show it would be good afternoon bbcrazies

6441814 we left the house we left everything and came on foot because to stay there was impossible
6441815 they are burning the houses from most of the houses they are taking everything they are stealing everything even such things as toothbrushes and toilets they are taking the toilets imagine they are taking broken refrigerators
6441816 we are so heartbroken i dont know what to say or even think our whole lives we were working to save something and one day we lost everything now i have to start everything from the very beginning
6441817 there was a bomb in the garden and all the apples on the trees fell down
6441818 the wall fell down all the windows were destroyed and now there is nothing left because of the fire
6441819 they came and asked us for wine but first we had to drink it ourselves to show that it was not poisoned then they drank the wine themselves and then they said to leave this place as soon as possible otherwise they would kill us the russians were looking for anyone who had soldiers in their home if anyone had a georgian soldier at home they burned the houses immediately
6441820 he was trying to keep the house and the fields
6441821 afterward he wanted to leave but he was circled by soldiers it was impossible he was in the orchards hiding from the russians in case they lit the house he was walking and met the russian soldiers and he made up his mind that he couldnt stay any more the russian soldiers called him and asked where he was going if he was going to the american side
6441822 so the russians view you as the american side even though there are no americans here
6441823 they support us so much we thought we were alone i am so thankful for the support we have from the united states and from the west the support is very important for us
6441824 working with isps to educate consumers is a more effective way of combating illegal downloading

6441827 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism

6441838 lo psichiatra e autore del libro kahr brettha ha tirato fuori questi numeri dopo aver analizzato un campione di ben 18 mila ultradiciottenni inglesi per concluedere che
6441839 ich wei damit du es nicht ernst meinen k nntest klingt es von dir viel zu bizarr

6441843 it was one of the things that spurred us on at first we didnt really know each other that well but we just started busking and everyone loved it from little kids to old grannies and everyone in between
6441844 we sold 10 000 copies of our debut album like that about 200 a day
6441845 we had an industrial cd burner so we would spend friday nights getting them ready to sell that weekend
6441846 since weve been selling cds busking people have been sharing them showing their friends who have been wondering whats that
6441847 its a bit of a gimmick in a way but it has a different character it also encourages you to compose in a very different way there are many more limitations than if we had drums bass sax and i was playing piano or guitar a more standard quartet you dont have chromatic options you have to work within these confines that have made us develop an unusual sort of sound
6441848 some of the earlier stuff was most closely paralleled to steve reich but it doesnt really sound reichy or glassy to me its definitely patterns and cycles changed by different harmonies on other instruments but to be honest i hear hip hop and rock rhythms and some more experimental playing from the sax
6441849 the link with reich is more relevant to our processes than the actual end sound using cyclical refrains on the hangs that build in texture rather than harmonic progression which i suppose is arguably minimalist but the end result is not minimalist
6441850 this is the first era where youve been able to grab music so quickly from all different sources using the internet
6441851 everyones absorbing everything its part of globalisation its not rigid anymore people are crossing borders the lines are blurring its all grouped as post jazz although a lot of it is moving out of the jazz idea as well
6441852 more than anything its just post modern music it all draws from so much different stuff that you cant put it down everyone borrows all the bits they want and puts it together
6441853 its amazing and a great excitement and surprising on some levels but also on other levels not surprising because weve always believed in the music
6441854 i dont think you project that far ahead you just play music but the belief has always been there we play music that draws from jazz but we operate with much more of an indie ethos everything thats come our way is a result of that
6441855 more people are realising thats the best way to do it now
6441856 weve done the diy approach in a really hardcore way with busking making the cds and all that and it shows you dont always need record companies to do well
6441857 also i dont think a jazz band has won in a while so i think it would mean a lot for opening peoples minds to this kind of music when roni size won it did a lot for drumnbass so maybe we could do the same for jazz its been a really good year for british jazz or post jazz with loads of bands doing things people might like they deserve to be recognised and people should be aware of them if we won it could be like a gateway to new audiences

6441891 i was real excited about reading this being a big fan of the movie and all but in the end was dissapointed it just seemed to be a bunch of random scenes with no connection and it was depressing people shooting heroin getting aids and dying all the time getting off the heroin and then going back to it also the hard scot dialect was difficult to read even out loud and irritating this is a book that requires a lot of patience

6441893 el ife se encuentra ante la necesidad urgente de contar sin condiciones y sin limitaciones infundadas por parte de la secretar a de hacienda con recursos presupuestales para la debida implementaci n de sus responsabilidades en materia de radio y televisi n
6441894 el tema del presupuesto no s lo afecta al ife les afecta a ustedes en alusi n a los institutos estatales electorales a los partidos pol ticos y al ciudadano
6441895 tenemos una sola copiadora de los promocionales con la que se reproducen los mensajes a escala nacional estamos entregando en guerrero y en coahuila los materiales a pie y eso genera evidentemente ineficiencias y problemas en la instrumentaci n
6441896 yo creo que tenemos que denunciar eso y hacernos cargo de los incumplimientos que en caso de la secretar a de hacienda se est n generando y los posibles efectos
6441897 la inserci n de un cintillo que se ala o que contiene la frase de presidente leg timo en este contexto y en esta propaganda pol tica no resulta denigrante ni en s misma ni en su contexto a la instituci n de la presidencia de la rep blica y no hay lesi n a instituci n alguna

6441900 alla fine tutto va messo alla prova le idee i propositi quel che si crede di aver capito e i progressi che si pensa di aver fatto e il banco di questa prova uno solo la propria vita a che serve essere stati seduti sui talloni per ore a meditare se non si con questo diventati migliori un po pi distaccati dalle cose del mondo dai desideri dei sensi dai bisogni del corpo a che vale predicare la non violenza se si continua a profittare del violento sistema delleconomia di mercato a che serve aver riflettuto sulla vita e sulla morte se poi dinanzi a una situazione drammatica non si fa quel che si detto tante volte bisognerebbe fare e si finisce invece per ricadere nel vecchio condizionato modo di reagire
6441901 what i tried was so unheard of they did not know how to deal with me
6441902 yao shows me respect he should he realizes what i did won the big money for him
6441903 that was the first game my girlfriend came to see me play i scored 40 points and had 30 rebounds on him
6441904 too bad i had already paid for the check i shouldve asked for a discount getting free meals for being a sports celebrity would be very americanized of me dont you think
6441905 i built a bridge it does not matter who did but maybe this did more than something for china maybe it did something for basketball my regret would be if i had not tried
6441906 hay que dejar esto muy claro sin recursos presupuestales urgentes el ife est imposibilitado de garantizar el cumplimiento cabal de las nuevas disposiciones en materia de radio y televisi n
6441907 sin experiencia sin recursos con una gran desconfianza por parte de los concesionarios el ife se ha dado a la tarea de construir el nuevo entramado reglamentario a trav s del cual la difusi n de propaganda pol tico electoral deber difundirse en todo el pa s

6441924 you have to put into consideration that if kids arent in school on fridays parents may need to send their children to day care
6441925 we need to have at least 180 days of school
6441926 if we taught four days instead five while keeping the same amount of hours each day we would need to continue school into the summer that wouldnt really make any difference in costs
6441927 by shutting down that means all air conditioners boilers lights electricity et cetera would be off
6441928 if the buildings are completely shut down the team couldnt play any games or even practice
6441929 its pretty clear that now its not an option for us
6441930 it would be almost impossible because of the state education law requiring 180 days of schooling

6441936 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6441937 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6441938 he was a tough negotiator but always reasonable and respectful with the ultimate goal of growing the game
6441939 prices of essential commodities which include food grains pulses edible oils vegetables dairy products and some other products including kerosene soap and safety matches have more or less stabilised

6441956 were capable of being a loud abrasive rock band but theres more to the band than just that
6441957 i think we represented that well on the new album some people who know us through our hell raising live shows are trying to make sense of it nobody wants to make the same record twice you should let people do what they do and not analyze the shit out of it
6441958 we played at the highdive with reverend horton heat a couple of months ago and it was a really good time
6441959 its our first show with our new record so hopefully there will be a good crowd its a hip room
6441960 we have them so i dont see how theyre going to stop us from selling them
6441961 its fun to play with a four piece and its nice to have a second guitar
6441962 there are songs like welcome to the factory that are gritty and rocking then there are some songs with tender piano and some straight up pop stuff
6441963 hopefully we made something thats acceptable to all the songs were written over several months and there was no concerted effort to make something completely different there were a lot of late nights put in it took a month 30 nights of really shitty sleep in a row
6441964 our live shows are evolving were playing every song off the new album and we probably will every night
6441965 its good to feel like theres time to take a breath sit at the piano and play a waltz
6441966 well hopefully have the vinyl with us as well its supposed to be here any day now i love that kind of thing its exciting im glad they were cool enough to give us the green light on the vinyl most people just download songs now so i dont think there are too many cd s bought its nice to drop the needle on some vinyl also
6441967 i decided to go back to the midwest where i had more contacts and it was easier to get gigs
6441968 my younger brother joined then five years ago in 2003 thats when i consider when we really started the band and we jelled well
6441969 im making a living even though its a meager one doing what i like
6441970 i havent had health insurance for a decade but fuck it ive been doing this for 12 years doing 150 200 shows per year its what feels right i cant imagine doing anything else
6441971 i walk to work i walk back from work im at home at 6 oclock in my pajamas watching television
6441972 ive loved television since i was old enough to reach the dial
6441973 television is meaningful to me its frustrating and fascinating all at the same time
6441974 but property rights need to be limited to be effective the more we divide common resources like science and culture into small fenced off lots heller shows the more difficult we make it for people to do business and to build something new innovation investment and growth end up being stifled

6441988 there is not one linear foot of public access on the arthur kill on the west shore of staten island
6441989 the beach side along the east and south shores have 98 or 99 percent of the waterfront publicly accessible we need to get more people out to the west shore because the environment is spectacular
6441990 right now there are eight to 10 pairs of nesting ospreys or fish eagles as theyre also known
6441991 when i was young we had to travel to marthas vineyard or somewhere like that to see ospreys
6441992 on the shoulders of the day you see some of the secretive creatures
6441993 everyone on staten island think the deer swim over from new jersey but they have been breeding on staten island and pralls island for 15 to 20 years now
6441994 in fact some of them wind up migrating back to new jersey
6441995 towards low tide you can see egrets herons glossy ibises falcons northern harriers turkey vultures and other bird species feeding on them at the waters edge
6441996 staten island is one of the northernmost places in the country with persimmons
6441997 and they ripen in the fall after the first frost when there is not a lot of other fruit around wildlife flocks to them then especially in november
6441998 experten sagten das ist unm glich und wir waren selbst sehr berrascht als es klappte
6441999 the mechanic suffered an electric shock after touching the sidepod and steering wheel of the car
6442000 there was a high frequency ac voltage between these contact points the cause of which has been traced back to the kers control unit and a sporadic capacitive coupling from the high voltage network to the 12 volt network
6442001 the voltage ran through the wiring of the 12 volt network to the steering wheel and through the carbon chassis back to the control unit
6442002 only a small amount of energy can be transferred through this capacitive coupling effect however the energy is sufficient to cause an extremely painful reaction
6442003 the driver was insulated against the car by his racing overalls and gloves and therefore not in any danger
6442004 in addition to the measures required to tackle the issue at hand the extremely far reaching analysis we conducted also gave rise to other recommendations which are of great value for the development of electric kers systems
6442005 among the measures arrived at are changes in the design of the control unit to avoid capacitive coupling effects extended monitoring functions for high frequencies and a conductive connection of the chassis components to avoid any electric potential
6442006 to be fair it has always been a challenge because they are two top players
6442007 even if they werent skipper or if it was someone it would still be a challenge for me to get in the team
6442008 it was good to get back on the pitch everyone likes to play for england and im no different from anyone else so i enjoyed myself
6442009 it would have been nice to get the victory we will be in good shape for the qualifiers hopefully it will go alright
6442010 for centuries people appreciated only the beautiful works of art and long life of the colours but little did they realise that these works of art are also in modern language photocatalytic air purifier with nanostructured gold catalyst
6442011 these vocs create that new smell as they are slowly released from walls and furniture but they along with methanol and carbon monoxide are not good for your health even in small amounts
6442012 gold when in very small particles becomes very active under sunlight
6442013 the electromagnetic field of the sunlight can couple with the oscillations of the electrons in the gold particles and creates a resonance
6442014 the magnetic field on the surface of the gold nanoparticles can be enhanced by up to hundred times which breaks apart the pollutant molecules in the air
6442015 this technology is solar powered and is very energy efficient because only the particles of gold heat up
6442016 in conventional chemical reactions you heat up everything which is a waste of energy

6442019 situations that some people outside the police believe that should be black and white are often grey
6442020 mr wallace was discovered with bindings on his wrists and ankles the bindings were of freely available bungee cord type material
6442021 however its not clear yet whether any one else was involved with his death
6442022 its also possible he was walking in and around the central city area and the viaduct basin during that period
6442023 mr wallace had a distinctive gait in that he shuffled more than walked and those who were in contact with him before he died described him as being visually unwell
6442024 its quite possible he had visited food outlets and used public transport to assist him get around the city last weekend
6442025 weve been finding out about each other and its so exciting

6442030 well for one thing the spring garden road library is actually too small to serve the population of the peninsula itself we only buy what we have room for so the size of the building does make a difference
6442031 one of the other key problems is that the building doesnt have universal access so people with disabilities arent able to use the complete building
6442032 another problem is that there really isnt anywhere to sit and theres no room to put in any computer technology beyond whats there right now and what we have in the building now is very inadequate
6442033 also there are structural issues with building for example the third floor of the building is held up by the book stacks on the second floor
6442034 so were not able to enhance service or provide any qualitative service from that building in its present state
6442035 vital centre for learning and culture in the heart of the community
6442036 we have known for some time that young and middle aged adults who are overweight run a higher risk of death and it was presumed that this held true for older people in fact our results show that the risk of dying is higher only for the most severely obese but that all older people who are overweight are at significantly increased risk of developing problems with mobility and carrying out everyday tasks
6442037 this research is important because a growing proportion of the population is aged 65 or over and more and more of these older people are overweight in fact in most developed countries middle aged and elderly adults are more likely to be obese than people in any other age group these findings have huge significance for the delivery of health care both now and in the future increasing numbers of older people and higher levels of overweight and obesity will lead to a greater burden of disability and ill health and place an immense strain on health and social services the issue is likely to get worse as time goes on and represents a ticking time bomb for health services around the world
6442038 staying a healthy weight can be a fun and relatively easy thing to do even as people get older
6442039 our experience of running supported walking and cycling groups has shown that older people benefit in many ways from regular physical activity
6442040 people are living longer but this study shows that excess weight can have a real impact on the quality of peoples lives which can reduce the benefit of those extra years
6442041 these findings provide further evidence that the health system is falling short of where it needs to be to ensure health and economic security we need a new administration to make universal and affordable health insurance available
6442042 whats happened number one young people liberals a solid core of obamas base just raising some questions about him for liberals maybe the perception that hes flip flopped on some key issues like fisa and a sense that for young people i think especially that maybe hes not the unique different sort of political persona that they expected
6442043 it was one of washingtons biggest scandals and the republican power broker ralph reed was in the middle of it in deep with convicted felon and lobbyist jack abramoff but when the senate investigated the senator in charge never even called reed to testify that senator john mccain and who is now raising money for mccains campaign ralph reed for twenty six years in washington john mccain has played the same old games we just cant afford more of the same
6442044 if we dont reenact the draft i dont think well have anyone to chase bin laden to the gates of hell
6442045 maam let me say that i dont disagree with anything you said
6442046 one this is the best military weve ever had and its just not big enough two there has never been a draft that i have ever heard of since world war ii that was fair what weve done is we find rich people find a way out and lower income people are the ones that serve so the thing if you could design i might consider it i dont think its necessary i might consider it if you could design a draft where everybody equally would serve
6442047 i have become very concerned with the possibility that this administration may have violated federal law by using the resources of our intelligence agencies to influence domestic policy processes or opinion
6442048 we are aware of the media reports and therefore we have to look into it
6442049 im duty bound to follow the law and apply to the law to the facts as i find them and it is on behalf of those millions of americans who believe in and value our democratic process and the right to vote that i put forth this objection today if they are willing to stand at polls for countless hours in the rain as many did in ohio then i should surely stand up for them here in the halls of congress this objection does not have at its root the hope or even the hint of overturning the victory of the president but it is a necessary timely and appropriate opportunity to review and remedy the most precious process in our democracy i raise this objection neither to put the nation in the turmoil of a proposed overturned election nor to provide cannon fodder or partisan demagoguery for my fellow members of congress i raise this objection because i am convinced that we as a body must conduct a formal and legitimate debate about election irregularities i raise this objection to debate the process and protect the integrity of the true will of the people

6442057 part of what id like to do is talk to the prime minister and see what still remains to be done what still needs to be closed
6442058 i think its a chance for me to sit with the prime minister and really get a sense of what if there is anything else that we need to do from washington to get to closure on the agreement
6442059 the negotiators have made really good progress they are satisfied with where they are
6442060 but obviously it is going to be the prime ministers call so this is a chance for me to sit there with him
6442061 all around the gate i saw blood and human flesh people helped the injured and took them in their cars and even on motorbikes to the hospital

6442063 the future of this coalition is linked to the restoration of judges
6442064 if the judges are not restored we will prefer to sit on opposition benches
6442065 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6442066 in the past weve usually had flooding in pockets i have not seen anything this widespread throughout the county
6442067 if it was a category 1 2 or 3 hurricane making a direct hit on jacksonville youd have something
6442068 of course testing is a necessary step how can we otherwise get to know whether the ea is profitable or not
6442069 when developing programs testing is an obligatory procedure you cannot always write even a small module without errors testing detects the main errors
6442070 for example you can develop a good ts but not pay much attention to mechanical working with orders i always say that mechanics cannot be simple simple working with orders is a frequently occurred mistake the system itself gives a good signal but the mechanical part fails and the signal is missed as a result the ts does not produce the desired effect testing may help detect such problems
6442071 it is important to get correct data before testing the number of skipped bars must be minimized
6442072 the main mistake is to over fit and to make a wrong conclusion about the profitability of the ea it is likely to be made by 100 of all newbies
6442073 this is one of the most complicated problems in the process of ea development an expert advisor without parameters would be ideal but there are no such eas so we cannot do without optimization
6442074 many perceive the notion of curve fitting as something negative i think it is not so curve fitting can be correct or incorrect if after having curve fitted a certain period in history you test the same inputs in the next period and they show a good quality it means that the curve fitting was correct
6442075 if the trend is up on these timeframes i prefer to buy after having tested the inputs in a larger range of data i find the smaller range where the trading system shows the best values then i find better values in the selected range but average ones not extremes
6442076 ich war noch nie in meinem ganzen leben so gesund

6442084 id say it was more out of frustration than anything else but thats in the past now and im just looking forward to getting back into training for the final
6442085 we are for some reason continuing to knock holes in that remaining urban grid the hotel sierra site the old circular gas station at atwells and broadway the old public safety complex the one ten westminster site grants lot what is next the arcade
6442086 i suspect that in many ways the city is encouraging unadulterated demolition developers can bring financially shaky proposals to the table knowing full well that if their financing falls through theyll be allowed to park cars on the vacant lot the procaccianti group has even gone so far as to cry financial hardship about the minimum landscape requirements for a surface lot the city needs to start defending itself against these sorts of predatory developers
6442087 ironically last week i asked my staff to see what was happening there
6442088 the word i got back is that they want to make an appointment with me next week to talk about it that could mean anything it could mean its delayed a year or so and they want to do temporary parking it could mean its delayed six months it could mean anything
6442089 every time something like this happens it makes you sit down and review your regulations and this is one of the things well have to sit down and think about

6442179 i am deeply sad that leo has passed away he was a personal friend for well over 40 years
6442180 i worked with him first as his constituency party secretary and later of course as his successor as mp for torfaen
6442181 he was a very distinguished parliamentarian and social reformer who has left an indelible mark on his country the lives of millions of people over the years have been improved because of his social reforms
6442182 leo was a passionate welshman and a fine constituency mp for the eastern valley which he represented in parliament for nearly 30 years
6442183 i personally owe him a great debt and i know that mps from all sides of the house will mourn his passing
6442184 leo was courageous highly principled very funny and totally unique
6442185 we are glad that he had such a long and fulfilling life in which he gained so much social progress by being an outstanding free thinking socialist
6442186 it is very rare for one mp to have been involved in so many major pieces of social legislation in relation to homosexuality divorce and abortion which have had a huge impact on the whole of british society
6442187 that is perhaps a tribute to how leo used his legal knowledge built up in his law practice leo abse and cohen and then applied it to his work in the house of commons in such a remarkable way
6442188 when i first joined the labour party in 1963 it was as a member of cardiff south east labour party whose full time office was in the attic above leo abse and cohen headquarters at 36 churchill way cardiff
6442189 his passing is a huge loss to politics and public life in wales and he will be fondly remembered in torfaen in cardiff and throughout britain
6442190 leo abse was a courageous campaigner and a superb representative for the people of pontypool and torfaen for more than 30 years his loss will be felt not only in the labour movement but across the political spectrum
6442191 our thoughts are with his wife ania and his family at this very sad time
6442192 as a nation we should be grateful for his contribution as a parliamentarian he spearheaded some of the most momentous changes in legislation paving the way for greater equality
6442193 his successes in parliament freed many from the shackles of paternalism and bigotry allowing us some of the basic liberties we now take for granted
6442194 his commitment to justice and modernity made him a formidable force in the case for change

6442210 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights genes tremendous love of the game also showed in his wide ranging support of football at all levels it is a sad day for the nfl but genes positive impact and legacy will live on for decades to come all of us in the nfl reach out with our sympathy to terri and the upshaw family
6442211 i would like to extend my deepest condolences to the family and friends of gene upshaw
6442212 he was a giant in the nfl since entering the league in 1967 first as a hall of fame offensive lineman then as an active member of the collective bargaining process in the late 1970s and early 1980s and finally as the executive director of the nflpa gene continually served in the best interests of the game of football he played a colossal role in the success the nfl enjoys today even more than many people realize

6442248 the mechanic suffered an electric shock after touching the sidepod and steering wheel of the car
6442249 there was a high frequency ac voltage between these contact points the cause of which has been traced back to the kers control unit and a sporadic capacitive coupling from the high voltage network to the 12 volt network
6442250 the voltage ran through the wiring of the 12 volt network to the steering wheel and through the carbon chassis back to the control unit
6442251 only a small amount of energy can be transferred through this capacitive coupling effect however the energy is sufficient to cause an extremely painful reaction
6442252 the driver was insulated against the car by his racing overalls and gloves and therefore not in any danger
6442253 in addition to the measures required to tackle the issue at hand the extremely far reaching analysis we conducted also gave rise to other recommendations which are of great value for the development of electric kers systems
6442254 among the measures arrived at are changes in the design of the control unit to avoid capacitive coupling effects extended monitoring functions for high frequencies and a conductive connection of the chassis components to avoid any electric potential

6442292 we are proud to offer these new products which will address the rapidly increasing needs of our full video voice and data digital services customers setting a new benchmark in battery performance and life while retaining the existing system foot print for maximum customer convenience with the demonstrated market need from our current customers we would estimate that this new product family should provide 50 million in an incremental cumulative revenue opportunity over the next three years exceeding approximately 30 million in annualized sales by 2011 as it penetrates the market in north america in addition we will use this design as a platform to more aggressively penetrate the rapidly developing markets outside of north america as we now set our sights on expanding from our 1 position in north america to become the global leader in energy storage solutions

6442355 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6442356 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6442357 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist
6442358 if you want to play this game you go right ahead but we are good at it and we are not afraid to hit you very hard when we punch back i bet this will give obama a bit of a pause
6442359 for 26 years in washington john mccains played the same old games we just cant afford more of the same

6442365 we put a lot of trust in her today and she came through with the goods
6442366 i have thrown him in the deep end several times one of the biggest games last year was against sydney and he was outstanding thats why you have a back up goalkeeper we have no problems using him
6442367 this is his second year and he seems to get better at training every week hes got the height hes confident in the air and he had nearly a season in the victorian premier league as well so hes ready to go
6442368 brebner is very close hes looking good at training hes a high quality player hes good at keeping possession hes got great vision and is a great passer and hes training very well we have got a squad of 22 players and they are all very important to our success this year
6442369 we learned a lot about them they no doubt learned a lot about us they are a tough team uncompromising they dont create many chances but they prevent other teams like ourselves from creating chances
6442370 we are certainly not underestimating wellington they are one of the most improved teams in the league they are good at negating the oppositions attacking prowess
6442371 last year was a year of draws for us we didnt actually lose that many games and we have changed our mindset the pre season cup has shown that we really attack teams so it this game will be a good yardstick as to how we play attacking football
6442372 we just hope that common sense prevails and they dont run the story
6442373 but here were talking about repeated intrusions were talking about arriving unannounced at his home
6442374 were not talking about a bloke whos broken a law or failed to meet community standards were talking about a bloke with a serious brain injury a bloke that is extremely vulnerable and a bloke whose representatives have told the media ad infinitum that hes not in a position to be conducting interviews in that context its extremely disappointing
6442375 as these words are being written russian mechanized troops are moving against the republic of georgia
6442376 strategically the russians have been sending signals that they really wanted to flex their muscles and theyre upset over kosovo the diplomat said during one meeting on kosovo in brussels this year mr lavrov the foreign minister warned ms rice and european diplomats that if they recognized kosovo they would be setting a precedent for south osseta and other breakaway provinces weve placed ourselves in a position that globally we dont have the wherewithal to to do anything mr friedman of stratfor said one would think under the circumstances wed shut up
6442377 russias only worry is the united states which currently has a lame duck president with low approval ratings and is exhausted after afghanistan and iraq but more importantly americas attention is preoccupied with a presidential race in which world citizen barack obama has mesmerized europe as the presumptive new president and soon to be disciple of european soft power most importantly putin and medvedev have called the wests bluff together with the dismal nato performance in afghanistan the georgian incursion reveals the weakness of the atlantic alliance the tragic irony is unmistakable nato was given a gift in not having made georgia a member since otherwise an empty ritual of evoking article vs promise of mutual assistance in time of war would have effectively destroyed the potemkin alliance indeed tired of european lectures the russians are now telling the world that soft power is well soft moscow doesnt give a damn about the united nations the european union the world court at the hague or any finger pointing moralist from geneva or london did anyone in paris miss any sleep over the rubble of grozny russia does not need a global force projection capacity it has sufficient power to muscle its neighbors and thereby humiliate not merely its enemies but their entire moral pretensions as well the russians have sized up the moral bankruptcy of the western left they know that half a million europeans would turn out to damn their patron the united states for removing a dictator and fostering democracy but not more than a half dozen would do the same to criticize their long time enemy from bombing a constitutional state we talk endlessesly about soft and hard power as if humanitarian jawboning energized by economic incentives or sanctions is the antithesis to mindlesss miliary power in truth there is soft power hard power and power power the latter being the enormous advantages held by energy rich oil exporting states
6442378 the russian are alcohol sodden barbarians but now and then they vomit up a genius prime minister and now generalissimo vladimir putin is mother russias latest world class wonder lets be honest putins the most effective leader in the world today not a single free world leader currently in office can measure up to czar vladimir the great putin not only knew what he was doing he knew exactly what others would do strategy and conflict hinge on character putions character is ugly but hes certainly got one on the world stage he comes across as a man among munchkins the empire of the czars hasnt produced such a frightening genius since stalin
6442379 russia won diplomacy failed no state or alliance will reverse the decision when president bush spoke out strongly on friday moscow ignored him words mean nothing to prime minister putin a man who regards all compromise as weakness georgia will never be whole again knocked off balance politically american leftists rushed to blame both america and democratic georgia their hypocrisy rivals putins putin is sending an unmistakable message to all other independent states that once belonged to moscows empire russia will not tolerate true democracies or western orientations on its eternal property apart from some tactical slovenliness on the part of the military things have gone perfectly for him his strategic acumen audacity and ruthlessness easily make him 2008s man of the year putins a russian nationalist he would have been as at home in the age of peter the great as in our time

6442382 the fourth assignment was to the following language how can you find a deliberate intent to kill do you have to see whether or not the man had that intent or not in his mind a year or month or day or hour not at all for in this day of improved weapons when a man can discharge a gun in the twinkling of an eye if you see a man draw one of these weapons and fire it and the man toward whom he presents it falls dead you have a deliberate intent to kill as manifested by the way he did that act
6442383 the sixth assignment is to the following language the law says we have no power to ascertain the conditions of a mans mind the best we can do is to infer it more or less satisfactorily from his acts a person is presumed to intend what he does a man who performs an act which it is known will produce a particular result is from our common experience presumed to have anticipated that result and to have intended it this is nothing more than a statement of the familiar proposition that every man is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his own act
6442384 god is always on the side of the big battalions
6442385 we are trying to do this without compromising the quality of education we owe to our students
6442386 our electricity is not fixed for four our water is not fixed for four
6442387 its a very nice political concept but its not an economically viable concept
6442388 i dont think its right for the board of regents to go back on its word
6442389 if you tell people one thing you should stick to it regardless of the circumstance
6442390 these cuts on top of that is what makes it more difficult
6442391 to see the kids grow from day 1 to day 35 it was astounding i could see that the program was really making a difference in their lives
6442392 their day is planned to the minute they are on a very specific schedule with very specific rules to follow
6442393 to see the surprise on their faces when they realized they could be successful that was amazing
6442394 both have come through the week and done well so theyll only get better with another outing
6442395 rocky is an influential inspirational player because he does intimidate and blokes alongside him tend to respond to that
6442396 its good to have him back and he certainly didnt enjoy watching the last outing the loss to the all blacks in auckland hopefully he will bring some of that grumpiness with him
6442397 its not a reflection of ranking and the volume of game time for the two players will not change
6442398 it is just the order we will be using this week and well be looking for matt to put the afterburners on al has performed really well this year and we know he is capable of going the distance matt doesnt have the same volume of game time under his belt but he will be an asset as it will be dry and it is going to be fast
6442399 i really dont try to think too much about footy because there is a trap in over complicating things
6442400 it is just a game after all you just go out there and do what you have to do at the best of your ability
6442401 every player has a disappointment in their career and not going to the world cup last year was mine
6442402 i then wasnt happy with my form in the arc australian rugby championship and so i thought to myself its now or never i decided it was time for me to really step up
6442403 stopping copper cable theft has always been a priority but now at amp t is stepping up its efforts
6442404 were hoping a reward of up to 10 000 will motivate anyone with information to come forward we intend to cooperate with law enforcement to make sure those responsible are apprehended and prosecuted
6442405 besides the added cost to do business because of the loss of materials and expense of added repairs utility copper thefts often disrupt service to customers including access to emergency services

6442412 these kids have already gone too far in not being held accountable
6442413 when you go into the work force if you dont meet the standards or deadlines you have to reap the consequences
6442414 its micromanaging and not trusting the fact that we are professionals
6442415 chief among the reasons children drop out of school is because they are failing their course work
6442416 we dont want to give them a pass but at the same time we dont want to pass them over
6442417 were going to have to come up with some concepts to keep a child in school

6442436 make sure your family is ok because the state of florida needs you here
6442437 in one way or another it has impacted the entire state
6442438 fay is still a threat and we are watching this very closely
6442439 this is a serious catastrophic event particularly for southern brevard county this area is seeing historic levels of rain
6442440 we are moving more resources in to support the most heavily impacted counties
6442441 the most significant issue regarding the slow motion is that fay will likely continue to dump torrential rains along its path and will probably be remembered as a very wet storm
6442442 the floodwaters are getting so high people cant drive in or out
6442443 these counties are currently in the process of harvesting these crops and rainfall produced from fay may jeopardize the entire crop
6442444 brevard will most likely receive a record amount of rainfall stressing sewer and water treatment facilities until flood levels recede
6442445 we were able to identify a tremendous amount of caregiver worry and concern and probably that worry affects their ability to fall asleep quickly
6442446 one of the primary predictors of institutional placement of persons with dementia is inadequate sleep in the caregiver
6442447 in order to prevent early institutional placement of the person with dementia its going to be critical to make sure that any possible measures that can improve the caregivers sleep are implemented

6442453 um acidente como este que ocorreu em madrid apenas chama a aten o para uma coisa que j se sabia e que a localiza o de um aeroporto dentro de uma cidade e de uma zona urbana que tem riscos que n o deviam ser corridos

6442455 contrariamente ao que se previa h pouco mais de seis meses j pouca gente acredita que o eng jos s crates consiga renovar a maioria absoluta
6442456 also its kind of documenting all the small moments that you wouldnt really notice or remember because it all really blurs into one haze
6442457 something where things are more ambiguous or suggestive you cant really tell whats going on but you can invent your own story
6442458 i kind of struggled whether to include that one or not because its so rock n roll
6442459 we had this bus that kept breaking down and the bus broke down in the desert between vegas and either l a or outside of san diego they all had to get out and push the bus and jump on it to get it started
6442460 when we started touring and staying in all these different places
6442461 it seemed weird to be in these empty nowhere places every night spending a lot of time in certain places but not taking anything with you from that i just like the idea of personal impersonal spaces
6442462 and started writing songs that i cared about i just needed to find myself in some kind of way somehow it turned into a full fledged project
6442463 ben folds was the primary songwriter for that other band so i think thats the big difference this sound of hotel lights is something ive been doing since about 2000 just kind of refining it and working on it
6442464 basically it was something fun for me to do to step outside from my usual routine with hotel lights
6442465 trying to write for characters in a musical but then i would hear the song and i thought i can actually pull this off too so that how it kind of ended up on the album
6442466 some of our hardcore fans had been excited about that song for a while
6442467 i always liked the song and i always wanted to do something with it it seemed enough time had gone by and i always wanted to record a version on my own
6442468 i dont think i knew what i was getting into
6442469 i just wanted to sit around with my headphones and write songs on my 4 track its been a really fun transition and enough years have gone by now that i have a great band
6442470 i was like this is madonnas underwear of course it didnt fit me
6442471 if theyre my fan they should be green days fan because they had some great stuff
6442472 everyone needs a different creative environment and adriano cintra the groups multi instrumentalist and main songwriter hes done music for like 15 years hes such a work aholic and he doesnt mind anything writing for him was kind of a survival thing when bad times came he was just writing and writing more which is very positive
6442473 she translates the portuguese sayings and it doesnt make any sense
6442474 in 28 years ive never had a desire to drive what kind of loser wants a car right now
6442475 moore had recently returned to his los angeles home to begin an intensive physical rehabilitation program
6442476 im just trying to do my thing in their river and really play a supportive role
6442477 its a beautiful place we live a peaceful lifestyle here but theres also a real dark underbelly to it its reflected in the name in the music in the message and we felt like we really hit home this time
6442478 for one music has moved into a day and age when people are going to quit listening on cd players so therefore the cd is an obsolete product if you will
6442479 to put out a cd and manufacture all that product to put out there when people arent really buying that medium anymore
6442480 im not leaving the dead kennedys so much as right now i cant perform with the dead kennedys for the foreseeable future
6442481 and its nothing to do with personal stuff or anything like that
6442482 sometimes i can look like homer simpson sometimes i can look like john mccain
6442483 its really neat if only i could make it happen at will

6442496 the bottom line is they had sold these coffins to people and they were imitations of an american made casket and so they got a restraining order to stop doing that

6442541 the presence of the three presidents in one church is a good sign in looking back to the greatness of ninoy
6442542 we should unite regardless of our political affiliations ninoys greatness has united us today as we remember and commemorate his heroism

6442558 i believe that timeline is important but whats more important is the content and the nature of the understanding that we can reach with the palestinians

6442560 when we are talking two states for two people the idea is israel is the homeland for the jewish people and the palestinian state is the homeland for the palestinians
6442561 i believe that what we called in the past left and right is something that belongs to the past
6442562 now most israelis understand that having two states in the lands comprising historic palestine is an israeli interest

6442683 again we emphasize that any changes to the coverage gap would need to come from congress
6442684 habeas corpus im not a lawyer and i dont want to be but it means you cant lock someone up without charging him or her habeas corpus is one of the founding principles of our government and it has been trounced on and violated by those people who now occupy the white house and the highest levels of office

6442692 arsenal is known for playing technical and skilful football and has a young but experienced squad im really excited about this next stage of my career hopefully playing my part in helping the club to new successes
6442693 we have a strong squad but a young squad and mikaels versatility experience and calibre will provide the extra depth we need to reinforce our challenge for honours this season
6442694 his defensive adaptability will serve us well and its a big plus that mikael has top level experience and a great understanding of football in the premier league
6442695 as far as i am concerned all that stuff is paper talk
6442696 i have said it before i am happy at hearts and am looking forward to the new season under the new manager
6442697 here in scotland it is unusual for clubs to buy players for millions of pounds except for rangers and celtic

6442699 i need a bit of pace in the team its something were short of
6442700 john utaka could give us a bit of pace and wide options for sure he can run quick
6442701 hes got to use that pace though thats the key
6442702 hes got to get the ball work hard try to use his pace at the right times and take people on at the right times that hasnt happened yet
6442703 hes got to put his game together a little bit more
6442704 johns always involved he is always in my thinking and could come in against united
6442705 against chelsea i just felt we would have been too open with him there so papa played

6442719 my work returns whats missing from life fragile moments within cycles of creation and destruction through performances and installations and the documents that record them i communicate a delicate dance between presence and absence creating work helps me come to terms with extremely contradictory experiences within the work rigid contrasts soften and boundaries become blurred fabric my primary medium is used to transform surfaces into gurgling landscapes my usage of materials within space allows me to create intimate experiences supple penetrable materials like fabric allow my work to have a softening affect the common thread is not always obvious mystery and romance hover unfolding myself as i work allows me to build environments that blur the relationships between particulars a clarification can occur as one releases oneself within the mistiness of the work

6442727 the client has to split up the calculations into pieces that are executed in a single server node and pass them to the jppf framework the atomic portions that are executed in a jppf node are called tasks it is up to the client application to define a reasonable part of the complete algorithm as a task small tasks may cause a high transport overhead while large tasks may cause poor parallelism in execution
6442728 the generosity of our members is the strength of our effort
6442729 our volunteers are leaders in their schools and their communities our work has set a new standard for our corporate partners to match
6442730 the stick was there i really dont know what happened it seemed like it was right there and it the baton jumped right out of my hand
6442731 i tried to reach for it but it wasnt there i should have made sure i guess its my fault
6442732 i feel like i let myself down i let my country down
6442733 this team being able to finish better whether its the fourth quarter or the end of the season is going to define this team
6442734 yeah wed like to get out of the chute and play well and winning hopefully comes with playing well
6442735 but i have to look at this with the hard work weve done conditioning with the hard work weve done trying to teach our team how to finish i think the critical parts of all of this are how well we finish in november will tell me a whole lot about this 2008 duke team
6442736 its been a huge buzz since coach cutcliffe came in a man of his caliber
6442737 all they hear is good things about this man and a lot of people are excited because hes doing everything to put duke football on the map its up to us players to go out on the football field and do our end of the bargain
6442738 everybody bought in fully that this is going to work
6442739 im a big believer in everything happening for a reason and coach cut the new staff they came in my last season
6442740 now i have the assurance that i will never have to be as pathetic as my siblings and live with mom again
6442741 i fell in love with a slit eyed lady by the light of an eastern moon

6442743 i am so glad you were there because the evening the weather the night sky and band with the mission as the backdrop along with the dramatic lighting well it was heaven
6442744 i hadnt actually seen lyle in concert until august 9th i was just a casual fan but that show made me a convert
6442745 i have seen lyle on several tours and this is my absolute favorite
6442746 the big highlight of the louisville show was that lyles monitor went out and while they fixed the technical glitch he chatted with the audience and told a story about a woman that was on the plane with him that came to the show that night
6442747 let us be grateful to the people who make us happy they are the charming gardners who make our souls blossom

6442759 everything youve done to be holy is like filthy rags compared to what god requires i still needed to die for you because you are so bad
6442760 when we heard that the palliative care department needed work and updating to make families and children more comfortable
6442761 it goes without question that we chose to direct the money towards refurbishing it this year
6442762 in the past weve almost raised nearly half a million dollars over four years
6442763 its been amazing weve had great sponsorships from companies and families and its just its been really beautiful this year weve planned a circus theme and were hoping for it to be our biggest year to date
6442764 its really a complete event where you can come and eat and going to be a great day
6442765 the shtern family has shown the community what you can make of a tragedy like jakes all the kids in the community now look forward to the event at the end of the summer and the fact that it was born out of a six year old boys illness is just incredible
6442766 xbox is a natural partner to help us reach out to youth voters
6442767 to realize our goal of registering 2 million young americans by this fall we need to go where young americans are and theres no doubt in our minds that many are on xbox 360 and xbox live
6442768 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6442769 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6442770 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6442771 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6442772 he was a tough negotiator but always reasonable and respectful with the ultimate goal of growing the game
6442773 its taken some time for publishers to recognize that a successful site is as strong a platform as a magazine newspaper or tv gig
6442774 it could take a couple of hours for our help desk to reproduce an issue from a users description of events
6442775 but it wasnt burdensome until we started planning to extend our web based policy platform externally to brokers then we realized we needed a better way
6442776 we wanted to track activities on knowledge workers desktops and create event logs transparently in the background whether the users were internal or external
6442777 but everything we found was targeted at development troubleshooting with the exception of some emerging companies that we disqualified as too young
6442778 they were using the bmc product but not as extensively as we envisioned
6442779 so we brought in bmc and discovered appsight offered traceability from redmond wash based microsoft windows and java at the front end all the way through back end servers and dropping off into the cobol path
6442780 a windows enabled server was acquired and deployed for the application with recording agents loaded onto each supported application server
6442781 we included about a page of documentation on the new error reporting process
6442782 in short a popup window appears that provides users with directions to follow then the information is automatically e mailed to tech support
6442783 initially we set up the solution aggressively causing event logs to be about 10mb
6442784 users consistently said it was taking too long to release their machines so we fine tuned the number of recorded activities which reduced the logs to about 5mb after about eight months of internal use appsight was included when the new policy platform was released to our brokers
6442785 previously whenever a tester found a bug it required several interactions with a developer to clarify the issue
6442786 now developers can simply play back the recording of the failed test case
6442787 in develpoment the number of tester developer interactions has dropped from an average of three to one
6442788 plus were reducing productivity barriers inherent to working across time zones cultures and languages because developers keep working rather than taking a day or two just to understand a testing issue
6442789 also weve discovered about 25 percent of incidents are actually training issues this eliminates sending out analysts to locate reported system outages at business units only to determine that a new user has failed to click the proper screen tab

6442816 when ukraine prioritises its national interests it goes against russias interests and of course there will be conflict
6442817 and russia has broken through a psychological barrier to start this kind of war on former soviet territory georgia had created itself in the shape of an enemy of russia and many in russia already see us in the same way we probably rank third in the list of russias leading enemies
6442818 in that situation then russia will start playing games start provoking ukraine especially with crimea
6442819 when we think about our position on georgia i have no doubts the loss of sovereignty putting into doubt the territorial integrity of georgia this means revising the sovereignty of all
6442820 there is a reason to be wary in the short term future there is a threat in that ukraine is similar to georgia in terms of what has happened in recent years
6442821 but i find it difficult to think that the threat posed is a military one
6442822 russia relies on the fact that it has more of an influence over ukraine economically
6442823 if ukraine sorts out its domestic situation and consolidates its foreign policy in terms of european and atlantic integration and this goes at a good pace then we can avoid the south ossetian scenario

6442860 when advising clients we often tell them it is not a matter of if you sustain a privacy breach it is more a matter of when you sustain one
6442861 given our understanding about the risks to sensitive and personal information in organizations we approached dr larry ponemon noted researcher on privacy and data security practices to create objective tools that could actually improve a companys ability to manage a privacy incident
6442862 more than 83 percent of respondents believe that the individuals affected by the data breach lost trust and confidence in their organizations ability to protect their personal information as we have found in our consumer studies on trust these perceptions often result in the loss of customer loyalty

6442880 gov arnold schwarzenegger has taken on an unlikely role as one of the capitols most steadfast champions of a tax hike spurning his fellow republicans uncharacteristic effort to borrow their way out of budget trouble

6442887 but the compromise which has attracted a swarm of lobbyists in the waning days of the legislatures session might be a lose lose for some small charities particularly in the sacramento area and for manufacturers of electronic games that look and play like slot machines but are advertised as

6442960 local law enforcement is doing its job and they rely on the attorney generals office to do its job
6442961 people can get discouraged when work piles up and it will pile up more if they have no incentive to get it done quickly
6442962 when its done properly and well it can be pretty much iron clad in proving guilt or innocence

6442991 there are two equal and opposite errors into which the human race can fall about the devils one is to disbelieve in their existence the other is to believe and to feel an excessive and unhealthy interest in them they themselves are equally pleased by both errors and hail a materialist or a magician with the same delight

6443008 old mines like the orphan were mined in the 1950s under no federal regulations whatsoever
6443009 most mines today are above the water table which makes chances of leakage practically nil what we have now is a well regulated industry
6443010 we already have the clean water act the national environmental policy act and others that require comprehensive analyses before any mining is done so there wont be impacts to the environment
6443011 at this time were still evaluating plans on an individual basis but a regional study is not something i can rule out
6443012 we hear from the industry and federal government that today we can do it safely
6443013 but the burden of proof is on the proponents somebody needs to ask what is the cumulative threat to drinking water in the
6443014 but thats not the way we do things today we understand and know a lot more about uranium radium and radon and the impacts of those so to say some things that happened in the 1950s and 1960s will happen again today is not a good comparison
6443015 they would continue to be mobile through the aquifer and eventually discharge in springs impacting the human uses of water of these springs
6443016 statements that the historic operations at the orphan mine have been polluting horn creek are false
6443017 approached or exceeded the us environmental protection agencys drinking water standard
6443018 its pretty bad when j t osullivan is outdoing you
6443019 he had pretty good time he was looking downfield but it was like he wasnt really seeing
6443020 garbage awful awful awful awful were not scaring anyone and we feel like we have an offense that should scare anybody
6443021 we just had two different ways how we were thinking where we wanted to go on a contract and the rams the way they were thinking their philosophy thats where it came to a standstill
6443022 things really got hot and heavy wednesday and thats when i booked the flight when youre talking about this kind of money theres going to be some kind of gripes and concerns in negotiations no one gets 100 percent what they want so it was just the two of us coming to an agreement on some things
6443023 its definitely something im proud of and i can live with
6443024 ive been working out keeping a low profile staying away from sports radio and talk and all that kind of stuff i was in vegas the entire time at moms and dads house taking in their love
6443025 at the beginning of camp i hadnt asked for a trade as of recently we did
6443026 its a tough situation especially when you come into a working environment but my job is to stay professional im going to do what im supposed to do
6443027 if im not going to be treated fairly if my hard work and loyalty isnt going to be rewarded here then let me go somewhere where its going to be rewarded thats how i feel
6443028 honestly i think it should be completely separated i think thats why we have a department that deals with that
6443029 weve been communicating if communicating is talking thats what we have been doing at practice as we go forward i dont know i dont foresee anything changing if it does its in his court
6443030 they saw i was disgruntled they saw that me sitting to the side and watching and we know it wasnt going to work out well for either of us
6443031 we made the right decision they allowed me to go and im just happy to know that im leaving with good character
6443032 i talked to smitty coach mike smith and i talked to general manager thomas dimitroff we shook hands and we wished each other the best
6443033 arthur blank is one of the biggest reasons i came to atlanta him and michael vick michael vick had a lot to do with that by mike vick being incarcerated i knew my career wouldnt go that well in atlanta
6443034 im disappointed that joe didnt get a chance to compete because of his hamstring injury in training camp and because he didnt choose to come to offseason workouts so he didnt get a chance to compete were going to move forward we feel very comfortable with the receiving corps that we have i wish joe the best of luck as he moves on
6443035 its a business so i understand how things were handled what if some of their receivers went down they would have had me around to help i knew that and understood
6443036 if i couldnt play i would retire but i know i can still play
6443037 i talked to coach smith about that before and thats exciting to go get out there right away were going to have a good week of preparation and hopefully play well friday night
6443038 we want to give everybody an opportunity to work with the first unit and thats still the plan
6443039 i really was impressed with the way he handled the two minute situation before the half last saturday night he did throw the interception but he moved well in the pocket he avoided some pressure and he got rid of the ball hes got to make plays thats what really counts in this league making plays and doing what everyone expects him to do he obviously has the ability to do that now he just has to go do it
6443040 i never really got comfortable we just werent playing real smart to start the game
6443041 not really pleased with what many of our offensive guys did early we didnt get a lot done rex was a part of that
6443042 i dont know any more than you all do i thought i executed the offense all right and the bottom line is we just need to find more ways to score points
6443043 you media guys can get negative about quite a bit of stuff but this is the preseason in some areas weve done well in some areas we have struggled but all and all as a unit i think were getting better and i think were really going to show that in the next few weeks
6443044 we take a lot of things into consideration but in the end it comes down to a gut feeling you have i feel good about kyle leading our team
6443045 is it over nothing is ever over at any position we dont name any guys starters for a lifetime
6443046 i was scared to come through its good to be back
6443047 this organization has been great for me they gave me an opportunity to play 11 years and take care of my family i still dont have any animosity toward this organization especially the coaching staff the coaching staff is like family
6443048 i scratched mine if i get the itch i go ahead and scratch it
6443049 you always want to kind of go out on a high note but at the same time when youre as competitive as brett favre is and youve got the ability and the mindset to continue to play he just wanted to continue to play hes got the opportunity with the jets and hes happy and im happy for him
6443050 my career is over and this is a great opportunity for me to give back and help more kids here and in the state of mississippi it should be a lot of fun
6443051 i just think he needs to play and hes shown he can play he had a good game last week and needs some more
6443052 im just happy to be out here competing and im getting a chance whoever comes out there im ready to compete lets see what happens on friday
6443053 two one im not sure where they are right now
6443054 its hard to tell chad pennington hasnt had a lot of work right now but i feel really comfortable with chad henne and my evaluation of where he is i think hes developed a bunch since the start of rookie camp all of a sudden the game is starting to slow down and hes playing a little bit more comfortable in the pocket starting to see the field a little clearer and making some faster decisions out there in critical situations this guy is really showing me great poise
6443055 same side of the body and same leg but not the same injury
6443056 i spent some time this weekend getting treatment on it and hoping that it responds quickly like it usually does
6443057 its going to be up to coach what he wants to do i think hes been coaching long enough to know that the first game in september is the most important game for us
6443058 im giving jacoby jones every chance i can to work out of this and clean these mistakes up at the same time our team has to know what direction were going if somebodys back there putting the ball on the ground so david and andre are getting a lot of work this week
6443059 that is my goal to be ready for that first game it has been my goal all along hopefully it continues to progress up until that point
6443060 ive had a tough month its truly been a challenge for me certainly something totally different than ive had to ever experience just constant rehab

6443066 these italian teams are great to play because they share the ball well
6443067 you have to be able to defend when you play these teams and once we buckled down and frank started to get us out running a bit we got away from them
6443068 some people are so excited im making these shoes they start to hyperventilate
6443069 theres so much symbolism and history that has gone into shoes and a whole fetish world too
6443070 this was my chance to do what i wanted to do to actually have my dream of being an artist i had a studio for two years but i had no time to use it i decided to take a huge leap and see what the universe would come up with people have been overwhelmingly encouraging and theyve even passed on my work to friends its been great
6443071 the costumes must be suitable for physical theatre they must be wash and tumble dry and no sharp objects when theres 35 degree heat the costume has to be breathable it needs to have the period silhouette but with modern comfort there are an awful lot of requirements its more like costuming for the circus
6443072 there are not many periods in history when men got to be peacocks i love the idea of extravagant decadence of absolute opulence of rose petals strewn on the floor for men to stand on
6443073 people are anxious about it and they are confused about how to clean it you just dust it like you would dust a painting
6443074 how come oils and acrylics are better than fabrics how did that happen it seems that art mediums have a hierarchy and fabric is at the bottom perhaps because it is linked to women and crafts
6443075 women spend a lot of time making beauty out of things that would otherwise be considered not worth looking at
6443076 theres a huge mystery about shoes when i tell people about my collection they look at me as though ive said i create sunshine like its completely impossible not something a mere mortal could do i dont like to use the word empowering but theres something special about knowing how to make your own shoes i feel like if we have a nuclear war ill be alright

6443086 i met lucky from randam luck over soundclick com back then they didnt have the deal yet but a lot of hype around the san diego area then when randam luck got signed by babygrande we jumped on the band wagon that opened a lot of doors for us randam luck chose four of our beats for the conspiracy of silence album and all of a sudden we were getting e mails from people like vinnie paz telling us our beats are dope for murda i chopped up this obscure anime sample and the heavy kicks and snares are courtesy of 2deep
6443087 a friend told us that selfmade were looking for beats for the favorite album so 2deep sent a couple over and a few days later we got a very positive e mail back originally they wanted two beats but the 2 nd one was later cut the beat favorite recorded on though ended up as the first album single and was no 1 on mtv trl for weeks we were real stoked for me this track is definitely the deepest on the album the lyrics give me goose bumps every time i hear it
6443088 sci really wanted this beat though i had already promised it to someone else they recorded on it anyway and sent me a preview including the reef verse what i heard blew me away and i had a change of heart style wise its kind of mainstream with a simple violin melody and neptunes drums but itll make you bounce guaranteed
6443089 many people have died because of russias use of cluster munitions in georgia even as moscow denied it had used this barbaric weapon

6443091 highly dangerous unexploded bomblets now litter farms roads and pathways in shindisi and pkhvenisi
6443092 people remaining in these areas dont realize the dangers these submunitions pose and are at serious risk of injury or death if they handle or even approach the bomblets
6443093 we did not use cluster bombs and whats more there was absolutely no necessity to do so
6443094 we were playing with them as were the georgian soldiers
6443095 it was only when one of the bombs exploded after a soldier threw it that we understood that they were dangerous

6443135 yes that is it exactly thank you for putting into words what i feel to be true
6443136 on our last day together my escort said to me
6443137 you didnt write a book in order to get a radio talk show
6443138 it is safe to say that none of the writers in this book are struggling to put words on paper because they want a radio talk show or syndicated column of the daily newspaper they dont want anything at all other than to tell a story to explore an idea or situation through the act of writing unable to escape the sense that this story must be told the writer of literature more or less reluctantly concludes i am the person who must tell it or try to tell it an essay after all is merely an attempt it has no presumption of success and no ulterior or utlilitarian purpose which makes it unique a welcome open space in the crowded busy landscape of american life
6443139 a genuine essay feels less like a monologue than a dialogue between writer and reader this is a story i need we conclude after reading the opening paragraph it will tell me something about the world that i didnt know before something i sensed but could not articulate
6443140 the writer doesnt write for the reader he doesnt write for himself either he writes to serve something somethingness the somethingness that is shelter by the wings of nothingness those exquisite enveloping protecting wings
6443141 we zijn hier met zestien kerels en die hebben in deze wedstrijd samen verloren
6443142 die 1 1 had nooit mogen vallen dat was het breekpunt
6443143 hoe het precies is gebeurd weet ik nog niet dat zullen we even in de video analyse moeten terugzien maar die verdediger van duitsland had daar natuurlijk nooit zo mogen vrij staan en je weet van duitsers dat je pas van ze hebt gewonnen als ze in de bus terug naar het hotel zitten dus hadden we juist extra geconcentreerd moeten zijn in de slotfase
6443144 iemand moet hem missen ik was blij dat ik daar niet stond ik ben er al jaren mee gestopt maar alles was goed bij ons voorbereid de namen en de volgorde stonden vast jammer dat het zo moest aflopen

6443152 we were selling bottled water for 1 75 dollars per liter right next to a public drinking fountain that dispensed water for less than an eighth of a cent per liter
6443153 it just didnt make sense to sell water in a bottle when it is so readily available from the tap at a much lower cost

6443158 this is a question you have posed numerous times dominic and the answer is linc aint getting it the money is at the bottom of a lagoon in panama when the authorities came and dredged the shallow area for clues to the murder of company operative bill kim they found the bag there were just a couple of bad apples in the normally trustworthy panamanian police but thats all it takes youll probably find some panamanian cops with speedboats and vacation homes
6443159 if saras abductors did not kill her then whose severed head was sent to me
6443160 for our purposes the head in the box is from the cadaver lincoln went to identify at the morgue in panama city when sara went missing in the first episode of season 4 we will come to understand why the company wants lincoln and michael to believe that harm has come to sara and why they sent that head in the box when lincoln opened the box he did what 99 percent of the human population would do the sight was so horrific he recoiled and closed the lid
6443161 didnt michael promise that he was going to deliver half of the money to westmorelands terminally ill daughter
6443162 he did but he got waylaid it was what michael promised he had the money on him and was perfectly willing to do it but when youre running for your life you have to prioritize unfortunately michael never made it and we can only assume that the terminally ill daughter died peacefully in her sleep

6443175 a backup system isnt designed to be a 100 percent complete inventory of all e mails

6443239 if they only take a portion of them its possible they will return to their insurgent ways
6443240 you cant get rid of a program by shoveling it on the iraqi government shoulders
6443241 the last time we humiliated thousands of these guys is back in 2003 and we got the insurgency

6443258 our goal in designing cruze was to be bold not evolutionary
6443259 we wanted to take a big step forward making a strong design statement for chevrolet products around the world
6443260 we are proud that europe is leading the introduction for this global product

6443263 our results conclusively prove there is a causal relationship between immunization schedules and diabetes
6443264 the recent data shows that common childhood vaccines are especially dangerous to children with a strong family history of diabetes

6443266 the risks are as elevated as theyve been on inflation since the 1980s
6443267 this is a terrible time to be a central banker
6443268 the federal reserve is caught in the economic cross fire theyre pinned down and they cant do anything
6443269 with energy and other commodity prices currently on the wane the july spike in core producer prices is quite likely to be the worst we will see in the near term
6443270 so far inflation expectations remain anchored but thats a risk
6443271 it is important to withdraw this monetary policy stimulus in a timely way
6443272 that may require us to withdraw before we are certain all of the weakness is behind us and before we are completely certain that financial markets are as tranquil as we would like to see

6443276 we knew that the chinese government is extremely repressive and that they might respond to any effort to get the word out about tibet strongly
6443277 so i have been stressed and worried but overall in the context of things what he is experiencing is pretty minor compared to what many people have at the hands of the chinese government
6443278 i think this is going to work out assuming it is the chinese police that have him

6443282 i like what he says and i like what he represents and its a world stage today for any political leader

6443285 were always looking for ways to best comply with all provisions of campaign finance regulations and obviously take swift action anytime flags are raised regarding potentially problematic campaign contributions

6443328 if they had engaged there might have been considerable collateral damage if bombs had been used
6443329 no french soldier at any time during the incident came on the radio to say that they were taking friendly fire and no french soldier after the event has mentioned to the chain of command that this might have been the case
6443330 there was fire from machine guns on american planes that were guided by american special forces and we have no information that enables us to consider that the french soldiers were killed under fire from nato planes

6443339 they were promised the future of mobile phones but many owners of apples iphone 3g say the only future they have seen since its july 11th debut is a series of problems and software updates
6443340 it basically does everything i want it to do except for sometimes it doesnt it will open up give me a title page or splash card for a couple of seconds and then itll just go back to the home screen
6443341 were here in the heart of the financial district and i dont even have 3g connectivity so its kind of a bummer
6443342 its frozen quite a few times and ive only had it for two weeks its a little bit annoying
6443343 which could mean the headaches for some iphone 3g users arent going away anytime soon
6443344 its just kind of crapping out all the time before the update on monday it wasnt really getting calls very well it was dropping calls all the time then i updated on monday and now the calls function works fine but im having a lot of problems with the application and the internet browsing function so its really wonky these days its not very dependable
6443345 we have to remember that when 3g was launched in europe a couple of years ago they had very similar problems so we shouldnt blame this only on apple its a brand new network its a brand new technology gonna have a bunch of 3g phones really soon theyre rolling out their 3g network so were gonna see problems with this across the board because 3gs very new to us
6443346 thats my deadline if its not working by halloween im gonna go back to my blackberry but i think we should have some patience either that or maybe ill just write the word sucker across my forehead because i have faith in the iphone
6443347 some of the last generation nanos have been overheating and giving their owners minor burns so its not just spontaneous combustion where its going to light on fire and your hair catches on fire something like that but it will overheat from time to time and then you get some burns but this is the last generation nano the one they sold about two years ago the current generation of nanos hasnt had any problems reported
6443348 all gadgets are prone to overheating like that computers laptops things like that we should expect that pretty much all gadgets may overheat
6443349 there are things you can do you can run your battery for the full lifecycle of your gadgets battery life and never ever ever buy a counterfeit battery ever because those are prone to explode
6443350 although there was enough rainfall this spring to keep the trees healthy we are still in drought conditions in the western part of the state which surprisingly is good for fall color
6443351 this year the trees should be on a more typical color schedule peaking in mid october in the mountains
6443352 and a sharp cooling of temperatures in september and october would really cause the colors to burst as this stimulates the production of anthocyanin or red pigments

6443373 for a long time the board of directors has been aware that the two very different business models of ingredients and sugar respectively were not an optimal combination
6443374 with these words the board of directors asks the annual general meeting for a mandate to close the sale of danisco sugar to german based nordzucker
6443375 if the annual general meeting rejects the proposal the board of directors will consider it a mandate to work towards an independent stock exchange listing or other alternatives

6443377 we already have products in all those areas today but we want to be among the three largest and best in the world this requires an effort and could also involve acquisitions we are determined to be in the top three because we know that it is a market with solid growth rates

6443387 dublin voorziet tegelijk dat elke lidstaat om humanitaire redenen kan beslissen om de asielzoeker niet door te sturen
6443388 ons land vertrekt vanuit de virtuele realiteit dat de kwaliteit van de asielprocedure en de opvang in elke eu lidstaat voldoende gegarandeerd is en dat we dus zonder probleem asielzoekers naar alle lidstaten kunnen doorsturen dit is evenwel pure fictie zoals blijkt uit internationale rapporten laat de situatie in landen als griekenland polen slowakije op het punt van bescherming en opvang vaak meer dan te wensen over

6443396 this move towards so called healthier products means the whole way we balance formulations to control water activity has to change
6443397 to control future water activity you have to consider the start of the process
6443398 if you have done your job properly at the beginning then there is less of an issue as some of the water activity will be controlled

6443406 we can no longer take our extensive water supplies for granted
6443407 canada lacks sound information at a national scale on the major uses and user s of water
6443408 national forecasting of water availability has never been done because traditionally our use of the resource was thought to be unlimited
6443409 our lack of data places canada at strategic disadvantage for bilateral negotiations with the u s
6443410 this report is a one stop shop document that can guide us toward ensuring that we get clean safe water to canadians wherever they choose to live
6443411 the fact that theyre even taking this close a look at this issue is good news in my mind because theyve been away from the fresh water scene for so long

6443419 when we play against a team that waits and passes then counter attacks it is not easy to score goals
6443420 i wanted to play in a certain way because i wanted to know exactly what the problems were
6443421 it was important to see the reaction of the team in the last minute and overall i am quite happy i think we have taken another step
6443422 i feel like ive let the team down and the country down
6443423 unfortunately for the next four years i am going to be remembered as the guy who messed up

6443612 in 1976 before i ran no one thought that i would break the world record break it four more times and be able to win for 10 years no one could have predicted that the times i ran 30 years ago could have won an olympic medal this week because when i was running those times everybody was 15 metres behind i was running by myself running 47 02 or 47 10 every now and then you have someone who is just that much better than everyone else i take myself as an example
6443613 people forget that at the 1976 olympics i was the only american to win a gold medal in a running event
6443614 it was just me we didnt win any gold medals in anything other than relays
6443615 all you have to do is look at a competition like the penn relays you and go back 30 years the jamaicans have been dominating
6443616 theyre producing the best athletes in the world they all used to go to the united states to go to college now theyre staying at home
6443617 i dont know what questions youre talking about i havent heard any
6443618 i am the person who tests in jamaica and i tested bolt 15 times between last november and december
6443619 since he has come here he has been tested six times anybody who wants to cast aspersions on our drug program i say go to hell
6443620 he bolt has got five years of experience that you guys didnt see
6443621 no one paid attention when he ran 20 1 at 17 years old
6443622 usain showed from a very early age he had the ability to be an outstanding 200 metre runner
6443623 i was surprised to see how well he was able to mesh in the 100 and after he set the world record in new york i felt like he could certainly break it in the 200
6443624 and so if im him the next on my list is the 400 because im sure he can run 43 seconds johnsons world record is 43 18
6443625 usain will run what he wants to when he wants to
6443626 now that usain has done this it might take us another 20 years to produce another athlete as outstanding as him but we will
6443627 because the seed has been sown now theres kids running around jamaica right now wanting to be usain bolt and its something were going to have to channel in the right manner so that we can maintain our position in the world in sprinting
6443628 were looking at a petrol price cut of maybe just under r1 but it will be based on the petrol over recovery and then dependant on whether the department of minerals and energy dme changes wholesale or retail margins
6443629 the oil price is massively off its highs from about two months ago and is currently standing at 115 per barrel
6443630 there has also been a sharp retrace in commodity prices effecting minerals such as gold platinum and copper
6443631 the softening commodity prices have shown the reserve bank that inflation risks have not disappeared entirely but have softened
6443632 now the difficult question is whether the oil price is in a temporary pull back or not
6443633 but the oil prices after dropping significantly in the past month does seem to have found a stabilising base
6443634 we expect an interest rate cut only in the second quarter of 2009 with inflation peaking at about 13 percent
6443635 the softening commodity prices will help to ease inflation but it has a negative impact on the countrys economy as a prosperous mining sector feeds into a number of other sectors
6443636 platinum which is our biggest export value is down significantly to 1396 per ounce while gold is down 200 already to 823 per ounce
6443637 oil and copper is down but coal has been holding up extremely well
6443638 if the current oil price and exchange rate levels are maintained a further sizeable decline in inflation can be expected in september
6443639 south africa expresses the hope that the humanitarian assistance to abyei will help contribute to the alleviation of the conditions under which these people find themselves in at this stage
6443640 bears criminal responsibility in relation to 10 counts of genocide crimes against humanity and war crimes

6443660 the signing of the mou between the departments represents the desire and determination in all of us to tackle and resolve the common challenges facing us
6443661 south africa will offer five star luxury they will offer game parks tours and what we call bed and breakfasts the impression of a bed and breakfast in my youth wasnt always favourable yet in south africa it is a completely different option
6443662 those particular premises are often five star and offer you every luxury you have possibly known in 2010
6443663 its the diversity of the options which make south africa a tremendously affordable and viable competition to all the people around the world wishing to enjoy the world cup in 2010
6443664 accommodation is plentiful and of a high calibre in all the host cities
6443665 in terms of our stadium construction programme our deadline for the confederations cup venues is december 2008 those stadiums are there and they are being upgraded in terms of stadium readiness we will be ready by the end of 2009
6443666 it is important that we succeed in this world cup because nothing less is required to open the door for the last major event on the continent the olympics
6443667 it is about nation building its about infrastructure improvement for us its about country branding its about repositioning its about improving the image of our country and its about tourism promotion
6443668 its also about return on investment job creation and legacy these are the things that not only drive not only our nation but nations of the world
6443669 the staging of the event on african soil presents us with an enormous opportunity to showcase our country and our continent i want to assure all of you present that we are on track to host one of the best and most successful world cups ever held
6443670 our overarching goal is to host an incredible event on our continent and that it will be the envy of all
6443671 we are on the right timing the right track to ensure that all goes according to plan
6443672 if a victim comes into the station to report a rape incident the police officers assist them by taking them to the victim support unit which makes it easier for victims to open a case and get trauma counselling and medical assistance
6443673 the help offered to the victims through partnership within the departments and ngos makes a huge difference for the victims to overcome their problem follow ups are also being made by visiting the victims to ensure that justice has prevailed and check ups whether further assistance is needed
6443674 the partnership makes it easier for the victim not to be sent from pillar to post but receive all services under one roof i encourage the victims to make use of the police station as they are there to help them but mostly it is their right to do so
6443675 the shelters provide services to victims of gender based violence especially women referred by the saps and social workers
6443676 if our partners police and social workers realise that it is not safe for the victim to go back home they send them to us for accommodation at the shelters where they stay between one week to three months
6443677 if the programme can be implemented effectively by the departments victims of gender based violence could get assistance anytime they need it and wont find themselves in the shelters or living in the same house with the perpetrator
6443678 you dont have to go to school to be aware of the abuse take note of everything no matter how little it looks even a little push
6443679 women should be vocal and speak in one voice just like the women of 1956 who stood up against the pass laws we can also win this battle abuse if we fight together by speaking out support each other and seek help
6443680 this event is much more than sports for us it is about our ability to host the world it is about getting out from underneath the welter of negative press coverage our continent receives
6443681 when they come they will receive a wonderfully unforgettable african experience
6443682 we are confident that global perceptions of africa will change after the world cup
6443683 from the spectacular opening ceremony to the unfailing courtesy of all the volunteers and the performances of the athletes who represented the peoples republic of china we can all agree that these olympic games are simply phenomenal
6443684 de zondagopening past in een bredere trend we zoeken meer gemaksmomenten op een dag
6443685 die markt groeit en daar is genoeg ruimte voor restaurants en supermarkten in het buitenland zie je ook dat die goed naast elkaar kunnen bestaan

6443687 i could see the rain screwing up the africans out there i was at home and they were all getting gold

6443689 if i can be smart ill be okay i was mad at myself a little bit because i let my guard down in his first heat so tonight i went out there and executed and im in with a shot
6443690 i just kept telling myself to be patient be patient i knew if i ran a smarter race i could get into the final to me the 800 is the deepest event at the games its going to be a dogfight
6443691 the thing is in a relay youve got to expect one of the favourites or a couple of the favourites to drop out
6443692 the biggest thing is to focus on each other and thats what we did
6443693 were in the final and were really thinking about getting on the podium

6443700 it is imperative to honour the commitments made to the nation by the coalition otherwise it will lose its strength
6443701 i hope that our model for community based carbon offset will show that the carbon market can directly benefit local people while helping panama to remain an international leader in the global effort to reduce emissions from deforestation under the united nations framework convention for climate change
6443702 as the community replants deforested areas with native species we replant traditions vital to the conservation of our way of life
6443703 this is a very positive step toward confronting the ongoing devastation of natural resources and protecting the environment in the region
6443704 the ipeti pilot project if conducted in compliance with all of the regulations required by international carbon credit markets and local legislation will be our focus as we develop national standards and propose future projects in the context of the world banks forest carbon partnership facility pilot activities
6443705 this smithsonian contribution to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions is a direct result of catherine potvins foresight in adapting her studies of plant carbon uptake to panamas cultural and economic reality and represents a very positive step in support of our basic research on the impact of global change on tropical forests and water availability and our climate partnership with hsbc the world wildlife fund earthwatch and the climate group

6443785 epa should be evaluating the risks to bees before approving new pesticides but now refuses to tell the public what it knows pesticide restrictions might be at the heart of the solution to this growing crisis so why hide the information they should be using to make those decisions
6443786 epa needs to help shed some light so that researchers can get to work on this problem this isnt just an issue for farmers this is an issue that concerns us all just try to imagine a pizza without the contribution of bees no tomatoes no cheese no peppers if you eat apples cucumbers broccoli onions squash carrots avocados or cherries you need to be concerned

6443800 so when you give to the needy do not announce it with trumpets as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets to be honored by men i tell you the truth they have received their reward in full but when you give to the needy do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing so that your giving may be in secret then your father who sees what is done in secret will reward you

6443825 there are too many difficulties with it and the animal first of all has to be convinced to eat out of a tube its got to get to an aquarium and then youve got to find a product for it to eat which you can supply for probably a year
6443826 so i think for humans to try and keep it alive is just going to end up as a disaster
6443827 get it into the vicinity of the other cow and calf and hopefully the cow would take on two calves which would be pretty unusual
6443828 there were four cookie cutter shark bites in it and that has most likely occurred while it was out in the open water its just another thing that compounds the whole problem
6443829 even if they are able to entice the calf out into open water it would face a higher predation pressure from sharks
6443830 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin
6443831 the key here is hes weakening hes losing the strength to get him fed and to a pod that will care for him
6443832 look at all the people here today ive never seen a turnout like this at an issue meeting
6443833 pickens pitches alternative energy to about 1 000 at civic center
6443834 the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
6443835 fuck you fred if scorsese couldnt give me direction what the hell makes you think you can
6443836 if anyone is really that hung up on the secret ballot crap then they should be asked why they arent upset by the fact that current law allows unions to be decertified by card check the only change with the employee free choice act is whether card check recognition is at the discretion of the employer of the worker in other words it changes absolutely zero about whether the right of workers to organize is determined by secret ballot or not the only thing it changes is who gets to decide the manner of certification workers or employers
6443837 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6443838 wir sind alle sehr betroffen von der meldung und hoffen und beten dass das schlimmste nicht eintreten m ge
6443839 wir k nnen bisher nur best tigen dass die familie die auf der passagierliste des verungl ckten flugzeugs genannt ist auch in pullach wohnhaft ist
6443840 surely there is something out there that already does this
6443841 i know wherever you are it isnt possible that you are thinking of me ive had enough enough of this pain enough of hurting so much enough of crying these tears that mean nothing to you
6443842 mostly ive just had enough of living this half life im going to close this chapter of my life and let it go into the distant past where you belong
6443843 chief investigator gary howard told the knoxville news sentinel a drug sniffing dog smelled something on the truck during a traffic stop near crossville last week a search of the vehicle found no drugs but did find the cash in a hidden compartment
6443844 multiple agencies were involved in the stop and search howard said the money will likely be awarded by a court to those agencies
6443845 do you have any large amounts of cash on you
6443846 if you want your money the dea has it good luck
6443847 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6443848 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6443849 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6443850 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6443851 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6443852 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6443853 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6443854 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6443855 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6443856 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6443857 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6443858 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6443859 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6443860 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6443861 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6443862 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6443863 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6443864 who are open to doing something on the production side
6443865 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6443866 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6443867 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6443868 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6443869 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6443870 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6443871 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6443872 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6443873 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6443874 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6443875 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6443876 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6443877 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6443878 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6443879 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6443880 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6443881 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6443882 32 bar intro 16 bar break build 32 bar main section long breakdown build then back to the main line again
6443883 no vemos las cosas como son vemos las cosas como somos
6443884 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6443885 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6443886 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6443887 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6443888 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6443889 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6443890 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6443891 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6443892 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6443893 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6443894 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6443895 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6443896 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6443897 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6443898 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6443899 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6443900 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6443901 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6443902 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6443903 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6443904 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6443905 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6443906 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6443907 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6443908 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6443909 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6443910 but then again i dont need people with bad luck here
6443911 notorious by the seemingly impossible glossiness of its e3 2005 pre rendered graphical target demo killzone 2s history to date has been anything but impressive
6443912 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6443913 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6443914 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6443915 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6443916 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6443917 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6443918 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6443919 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6443920 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6443921 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6443922 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6443923 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6443924 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6443925 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6443926 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6443927 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6443928 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6443929 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6443930 when i met obama i realized that hes the same person face to face that he is when speaking to an audience of thousands
6443931 stress breaking down barriers that prevent people and ideas from connecting
6443932 in the competition between pcs and macs we outsell apple 30 to 1 but there is no doubt that apple is thriving
6443933 why because they are good at providing an experience that is narrow but complete while our commitment to choice often comes with some compromises to the end to end experience
6443934 in the weeks ahead well launch a campaign to address any lingering doubts our customers may have about windows vista and later this year youll see a more comprehensive effort to redefine the meaning and value of windows for our customers
6443935 the brainchild of crispin porter bogusky a miami based ad shop that has helped revitalize brands such as burger king
6443936 when the commodity futures trading commission examined vitols books last month it found that the firm was in fact more of a speculator holding oil contracts as a profit making investment rather than a means of lining up the actual delivery of fuel even more surprising to the commodities markets was the massive size of vitols portfolio at one point in july the firm held 11 percent of all the oil contracts on the regulated new york mercantile exchange
6443937 the discovery revealed how an individual financial player had gained enormous sway over the oil market without the knowledge of regulators other cftc data showed that a significant amount of trading activity was concentrated in the hands of just a few speculators
6443938 cftc data show that at the end of july just four swap dealers held one third of all nymex oil contracts that bet prices would increase dealers make trades that forecast prices will either rise or fall energy analysts say these data are evidence of the concentration of power in the markets
6443939 to date the cftc has found that supply and demand fundamentals offer the best explanation for the systematic rise in oil prices
6443940 for most of the past century regulators put limits on financial actors to prevent them from dominating commodity exchanges which were much smaller than the bond or stock markets only commercial operations such as farms airlines manufacturers and the middlemen that handle their trading activities were allowed to buy nearly unlimited quantities the goal was to allow these businesses to minimize the effect of price swings
6443941 when the cftc granted the 1991 hedging exemption to j aron a division of goldman sachs it signaled a major shift that has since allowed investors to accumulate enormous positions for purely speculative purposes
6443942 legitimate businesses that hedge and take physical delivery of oil are being trampled by the speculators who are in the market purely to make profit
6443943 were not going to let russia so soon after the iron curtain fell to again draw a dividing line across europe
6443944 the g 8 should become for a while the g 7 until russia proves that it is capable of being a law abiding member of the international community
6443945 the russians are hell bent on recapturing some of the territory that they believe is rightfully theirs that now is in the hands of people indigenous to the area who are embracing freedom and democracy
6443946 compelling the british government to release information that can prove mr mohameds innocence is one obvious step towards making up for the years of torture that he has suffered

6443948 san jose were the worst team id seen since the league started looking north of la for an expansion team
6443949 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6443950 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6443951 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6443952 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6443953 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6443954 if a new president and congress consider changes to the drug benefit it will be important to keep in mind that the coverage gap has consequences for some patients with serious health conditions
6443955 we urge beneficiaries to choose wisely when selecting their drug coverage
6443956 again we emphasize that any changes to the coverage gap would need to come from congress
6443957 we have pointed out to the international community from the very start that the unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo could present a dangerous precedent
6443958 unfortunately this has proven to be true much sooner than anyone expected
6443959 peaceful way through the united nations with respect to international agreements and international law

6443971 we will not try to bring the government down but of course then we have no choice but to sit in the opposition

6443973 members belonging to our party in the parliament asked asif to become the next president
6443974 the provincial leaders unanimously recommended to the central executive committee that it should declare zardari as the party candidate for the office of the president
6443975 there was an understanding between the coalition partners that the presidential candidate would be decided by mutual consensus
6443976 they have unilaterally floated the name of mr zardari it is their prerogative but we have not been consulted yet
6443977 ternyata manusia lelaki dengan pakaian seragam yang mempergagah dirinya dengan senjata lengkap dengan peluru dan sangkur tajam sanggup menangis melihat orang menghadap tuhan

6443979 hentikan tarian itu tuangkan kami arak tarian itu tidak bagus
6443980 lihat ia datang untuk menari sebagai penghormatan seorang seniman tari kepada gurunya bukankah itu tarian yang tidak pernah kalian selesaikan padahal baek mo meminta kalian untuk menyelesaikannya di depan para pejabat kemarin dulu
6443981 kenapa kau tidak memakai baju tarimu dan tidak menyerahkan buku tari
6443982 tarian yang baik adalah tarian yang menyatu dengan semangat dan hati
6443983 kau boleh menari di hadapan juri tapi karena kau tidak menyerahkan buku tari kau menari tanpa iringan musik kau sendiri yang harus mengerakkan para pemusik apabila kau gagal kau akan menjadi gisaeng yang hidup dari menjual tubuhmu untuk laki laki dan kau tidak boleh lagi menari kau tahu betapa sulitnya itu
6443984 myeong wol memang penari yang berbakat dan memiliki kemampuan menari dengan baik tapi untuk menjadi pemimpin bukan hanya itu yang dibutuhkan pemimpin haruslah jeli melihat bakat penari dan dapat memimpin para penari ia dapat bekerja sama dengan banyak penari atau menari dalam kelompok tulus menghargai dan menerima kekalahan dengan lapang dada itu yang telah kau lakukan bu young kau memiliki semuanya
6443985 ia gisaeng yang selalu bersaing denganku dia adalah orang yang terlalu berbakat untuk menjadi penari yang terkungkung di dalam padepokan tari
6443986 aku memimpikan sebuah dunia di mana orang dapat menari bersama tersenyum dan tertawa
6443987 begitulah seniman ditakdirkan untuk mengalami berjuta penderitaan karena pemikiran dan sikap hidupnya yang berbeda dengan orang biasa tapi bukan seniman kalau tidak menjadikan penderitaan itu sebagai penggerak karya seninya
6443988 he he he aku baru naik bis tadi waktu kamu sms sudah lama ya

6443990 ini menarik dian kamu tahu nggak kalau hantu lokal itu tidak dapat mengganggu orang luar artinya bule bule atau orang luar negeri itu atau orang yang berasal dari luar jawa tidak akan mempan diganggu sama hantu lokal ya mereka mana tahu yang namanya gendruwo tuyul dll
6443991 nah kalo orang luar negeri itu gimana apa tidak bisa diganggu karena hantunya bingung ga bisa bahasa inggris atau jepang misalnya ha ha hah
6443992 eh tahu film mumi mumi itu nggak mumi kan masuk kategori hantu dengan bahasa mesir makanya peneliti atau filolog atau arkeolog yang tertarik dengan misteri piramit itu wajib bisa membaca tulisan hierograf atau tulisan mesir
6443993 begini dalam buku ini dikatakan bahwa hantu akan memberi semacam kode kode atau isyarat isyarat untuk berkomunikasi untuk melatih kepekaan kita sebaiknya sering jalan jalan
6443994 anak anak dapat mencontoh dan berbuat lebih baik lagi karena dia juga melihat berbagai kesenian semisal topeng ireng di setiap daerah
6443995 dengan mengajak kelompok kesenian dari daerah yang terkena gempa itu juga dapat membangkitkan semangat mereka lagi untuk berkarya dalam kesenian
6443996 perkembangan itu baik adanya karena kesenian menjadi wadah kreatifitas masyarakat dan sebagai ajang respon mereka terhadap keadaan di sekitarnya
6443997 my goodness i hope people i n saudi arabia dont think everyone in texas is this barbarous

6444004 i understand that sen mccain was asked yesterday this question how many houses do you own and he couldnt answer that question he couldnt count high enough apparently to even know how many houses he owns
6444005 well if you dont know how many homes you own how can you think you can run the united states of america john mccain is the biggest insult to intelligant people i have ever seen as a republican i am sad that we have nothing better than john mccain to run against the dems
6444006 20 or 23 some closed last week i dont know
6444007 the great bob hope who entertained america for the longest time also had many houses and lots of land lets throw him under the bus too the message is getting clearer and clearer no more america this will be a socialist country stop your dreams people everyone must live in huts turn their heaters and coolers down and travel less the magic of america is gone if obama becomes president
6444008 poor people hate rich people attack a man because he lives the american dream and owns property yeah obama thats how you keep on message id say that obama is being divisive and not able to stick to the issues but that would be silly we all know that the obama camp has a lock on the divisive card myself i like a man that has so much business acumen that he can loose track of his investments would we be hearing slams like this if donald trump couldnt answer the question i think not mccain is wealthy and has multiple properties big deal let the cult of obama figure out how to distract the american people and by all means dont let mccains success and prosperity be a good thing
6444009 this gaffe would be all over the media mccain dumped his first wife for a wealthy cute 20 something
6444010 yes my wife is rich and she owns a several houses
6444011 does barack obama know how many brothers he has yet
6444012 it is not quite the first time we have heard of 26 year old george hussein onyango obama

6444270 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6444271 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6444272 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6444273 the negotiators have taken this very very far but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6444274 obviously the american forces are here coalition forces are here at the invitation of the iraqi government
6444275 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people respects iraqs sovereignty
6444276 but the goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
6444277 that is the goal and that has been the goal from the beginning
6444278 we are making progress together in the defeat of iraqs enemies of all stripes
6444279 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6444280 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6444281 really we are very very close to closing this agreement
6444282 and as we said from the begininng there is no hidden agenda here
6444283 but really we are redoubling our efforts to bring this to a successful conclusion
6444284 we as the sadr movement denounce this dubious visit and such timing we reaffirm our stance of rejecting the long term agreement we demand the iraqi government and on the highest levels not to sign this unjust agreement and we demand the withdrawal of the government as soon as possible

6444485 this document clarifies the rules by which the f b i conducts its intelligence mission

6444494 swm mvg setzen bei den stadtbussen traditionell auf die jeweils neueste und beste serienm ige technik deshalb sind in m nchen auch nur noch busse mit modernsten abgasfiltern im einsatz mit dem neuen solaris fahrzeug steigen wir nun in den dauertest der hybridtechnik ein damit setzen wir erneut auch ein zeichen f r den umwelt und klimaschutz die erprobung des busses im alltagsbetrieb der mvg soll zeigen wie sich das fahrzeug im allt glichen regelbetrieb mit fahrg sten bew hrt vor allem aber welche energiebilanz mit dieser technik zu erreichen ist wir erwarten dass der kraftstoffverbrauch im vergleich zu herk mmlichen dieselbussen um rund 20 prozent zur ckgeht
6444495 es gibt nicht den hybridbus sondern mehrere unterschiedliche konzepte welches sich letztlich durchsetzen wird ist heute noch offen deshalb ist uns auch der systemvergleich wichtig in k rze werden wir noch einen zweiten hybridbus eines anderen herstellers mit einem anderen technischen konzept einsetzen und ebenfalls auf herz und nieren testen
6444496 selbstverst ndlich geben wir unsere erfahrungen aus dem praxisbetrieb auch an solaris weiter auf diese weise unterst tzen wir den hersteller bei der optimierung der innovativen fahrzeugtechnik unsere r ckmeldungen sollen dazu beitragen dass die hersteller m glichst bald die serienreife der hybridtechnik bei bussen erreichen und die fahrzeuge in gr eren st ckzahlen finanzierbar werden entscheidend f r den erfolg ist dabei nicht nur dass die technik zuverl ssig funktioniert sondern auch dass dann eine wirtschaftliche beschaffung m glich wird dies ist heute noch nicht gegeben hybridbusse sind derzeit noch wesentlich teurer als konventionelle busse die wirtschaftlichkeit ist aber voraussetzung f r eine serienanschaffung von hybridbussen weil die fahrzeuge aus fahrgeldeinnamen also aus dem geld unserer kunden finanziert werden m ssen w re neue technik unwirtschaftlicher k nnten entsprechend weniger busse eingesetzt werden das angebot w rde also schlechter das w re nat rlich gerade in sachen klimaschutz der falsche weg
6444497 wir freuen uns nat rlich auf kundenreaktionen und sind gespannt darauf ob unsere fahrg ste unterschiede zu herk mmlichen bussen wahrnehmen der hersteller verspricht unter anderem einen geringeren ger uschpegel und eine sanftere fahrdynamik als bei herk mmlichen bussen
6444498 mit den kollegen in den genannten kommunalen partnerbetrieben sowie den spezialisten in unserem verband vdv wird ein regelm iger erfahrungsaustausch stattfinden gemeinsam mit der industrie wollen wir diese technik voranbringen unser solaris bus dient dabei auch als botschafter f r hybridbusse so wird er m nchen jeweils einige tage verlassen um auf einer ausstellung in berlin und bei der un klimakonferenz in posen f r diese technik zu werben
6444499 im very aware of the effect that the announcement will have on our customers and i recognise that this is a very tough time for everyone

6444501 its tough doing that because youre proving a negative proving you dont make money
6444502 if it were market rate it would be leasing up much more quickly
6444503 it takes a while to get all leased up and thats not a function of lack of demand
6444504 its just hard to get into one of these places
6444505 people dont want to be walking down the street and be able to pick out the low income housing
6444506 i know how we can make money we can open up a candy shop next to all the bars and have it stay open until midnight and entice all the revelers in with a giant sidewalk sign that advertises delicious free samples

6444533 for centuries people have been coming to the ness and because it is dominated by the two massive stone rings its come to be assumed that they were the main neolithic focus of the area
6444534 in light of this summers finds however i would question that interpretation instead of the notion that the ring of brodgar was the focus i wonder whether the stone circles were merely on the periphery of the true ceremonial centre a massive ceremonial complex fragments of which are now only coming to light its becoming clear to us now that this complex in its heyday must have completely dominated the landscape
6444535 colin suggested that the rings marked stages in a journey across the ness a journey which had a distinct end point
6444536 if that was the case were the ring or brodgar and standing stones of stenness a ritual or ceremonial portal into the ness complex something you had to pass through en route to the complex and not necessarily as has been long believed the end points or sole purpose of the journey
6444537 there is something strange about this site when you think about it being enclosed by the monumental great wall of brodgar and its position in the centre of the two stone circles you really have to wonder about its overall significance

6444590 watching matt sunday night hearing all the criticism i dont even know where that was coming from
6444591 that was so far from what i was watching the quarterback has a lot of responsibility out there i thought matt was making good decisions he was really decisive with his throws was every throw perfect no but that doesnt happen so often anyway
6444592 i see matt every day in practice and the improvement he makes i love what i see in matt i have a lot of confidence in matt for the three guys sitting in the booth i thought it was unfair to criticize the way they were criticizing because i dont think they really knew what was happening
6444593 its interesting to me because those guys were in the same shoes at one point in their career and they should understand how hard it is to go out there and perform each and every week
6444594 it looked as though the passing offense made a change as a confidence building thing with some of the throws for matt
6444595 i could be way off on that maybe i missed the boat and if so i apologize but from a players perspective im looking at it like hes already been in the situation for three years now and hes in a quarterback battle with a rookie and a guy without much experience if hes in a battle youd expect him to win it this was his opportunity to separate himself from the other guys he has to show why he is the no 2 guy in new england so i put more pressure on matt to perform than i did kevin oconnell you bet i did

6444608 you have to put into consideration that if kids arent in school on fridays parents may need to send their children to day care
6444609 we need to have at least 180 days of school

6444619 the new york state housing finance agency selected 80 dekalb to receive 109 5 million in tax exempt bonds and 27 5 million in taxable bonds the lending institutions involved in the transaction were wachovia bank n a and helaba both co agents providing the credit enhancement to the 137 million in bonds issued by hfa as well as the national electrical benefit fund which provided a 10 million mezzanine loan and 20 million of credit enhancement
6444620 we dont finance only the affordable units in a building we finance the entire building because the developer has committed to having affordable units in it
6444621 so our contribution is actually 300 000 per unit we dont finance buildings that are exclusively market rate
6444622 its also a tribute to our new york team and the relationships they have built in both the public sector and private sector financing community

6444643 gently provocative davie delights in the surreal juxtaposition of ideas and materials the meeting of contradictory characters cultures or visual elements such as colour pattern or form create intriguing dialogues in his work davies wonderfully ambivalent zinc and copperplate etchings watercolours oils on canvas and mixed media works inspire an imaginative response admirably davie treads his own path grounded in the scottish figurative tradition through his training at the glasgow school of art in the 1980s in this context his whole approach to the figure is brilliantly subdued and refreshing he conveys a sense of the monumental and iconic not through obvious physical scale but in terms of human aspiration the figure of the pilgrim soldier or shopper is a recurrent motif part of the artists iconography and of archetypal significance davie utilises fragments of narrative and symbolic characters in a way that is relevant and contemporary use of loaded text or imagery is beautifully handled as the artist quietly interrogates the promotion and dominance of lifestyle based western consumerism the evolution of his work in painting collage and printmaking demonstrate an adept understanding of the craft and the dynamic impetus of experimentation davies art explores contradiction rather than absolutes his multilayered compositions works of extraordinary depth irony and humour

6444740 we didnt have the choice of denying this project altogether because of the hand we were dealt
6444741 i support the motion at the end of a very long pathway because i think the project would be much different if the applicants had exercised the development rights they obtained long ago
6444742 i disagree with those who think this project sets a precedent for development along that coast
6444743 it doesnt seem like our thoughts on these issues are really having an impact on the decision making process
6444744 ocean views and the natural environment im not totally convinced that the protections we have included in project conditions are what they should be

6444749 things went quite smoothly thanks to all the teachers and support staff
6444750 we didnt have any major problems or issues pretty much students just kind of stayed away from the construction area
6444751 our kindergarten classes in the last three years have been larger than average and this year is no exception
6444752 right now were still working on identifying some people who might be witnesses
6444753 were not exactly sure what the motive is or what might have sparked it
6444754 were not seeing that that is a specific connection at this time

6444757 to stay in the solid waste business today you have to offer a complete variety of services so that the consumer can get rid off all of these waste products because of all of the legislation that has changed things
6444758 but we have stormwater management issues and we need to deal with things now

6444766 weve assessed watershed burn conditions we have assessed all our structures bridges creeks critical areas
6444767 were going to have a a series of public meetings to let the people know what to expect
6444768 im pretty confident from our sources that weve got the person that we want who weve been looking for
6444769 and with that being the case we will be standing here until he gets down to arraignment until he gets to the grand jury and until he goes to jail
6444770 what we got to do is make sure that predators like this guy are off the street
6444771 make no mistake about it when hes arrested when hes prosecuted and convicted we will ask for consecutive penalties he will be a very very old guy before the time he ever gets out of prison
6444772 america works best when it works for all of us

6444777 pedro slowed the pace down and nobody challenged him until they headed for home pedro took the lead kept it and the pace started off so slow the horses were blazing heading for home you could see near the end thatsrightofficer was the only one left with fresh legs tin cup is so competitive he wasnt going to get beat
6444778 ive been watching the races at saratoga for a long time thats what got me started
6444779 hes tin cup chalice only the second horse ive ever raced
6444780 this was my first start as an owner at saratoga there were some classy horses in this race i didnt know if we had enough left but pedro knew when to push the button
6444781 when he was sick with colic we didnt know if he would ever stand up again
6444782 but he stood up and hes been standing ever since he definitely deserves a rest theres more racing ahead for him but michael lecesse makes all the race decisions we are looking at a possibility about five weeks down the road

6444784 this is a way of raising revenue without hurting the locals
6444785 my personal feeling is that half a percentage at this point is not going to make a big difference
6444786 we dont generate hardly any sales tax revenue at all
6444787 those budget cuts will affect essex county greatly especially since 169 million is going to be eliminated statewide for nursing homes
6444788 essex county is one of the counties that has a nursing home it costs the taxpayers every year 3 2 million a deficit we have to cover from the general fund if the state cuts that out for us the potential deficit is 4 million a year
6444789 were over our budget in gasoline fuel costs and there is a tremendous need for emergency heating mortgage taxes are down and so the prospect of having to increase property taxes in the near future is hanging over our heads its getting much harder to manage county governments
6444790 the proposal of a half a point increase would result in a revenue of over 3 million a year for the county
6444791 what would that mean for the village of saranac lake it would likely yield somewhere around 40 000
6444792 it would be the first time the county wrote a check to saranac lake for 40 000
6444793 everyone is in agreement on the half percent increase the question that remains is how that one quarter would be allocated between the different towns
6444794 i wouldnt mind a portion going for capital debt such as a bridge bond
6444795 confirmed there was enough to charge mr rascoe with official misconduct
6444796 that put me in an awkward position the employees who were trying to help you had implicated themselves in the criminal conduct
6444797 the grand jury would have wanted to explore the behavior of the other six employees
6444798 and thats not what i wanted i felt a prompt resignation on july 11 would result in the goal of stopping this infection
6444799 i dont believe indicting seven of your employees would have been right

6444819 the ability to comprehensively sequence any persons genome is the type of quantum leap needed to usher in an age of personalized medicine where healthcare providers can use an individuals genetic code to prevent diagnose and treat diseases
6444820 a new generation of sequencing technologies is stepping in front of the already impressive technologies that enabled initial sequencing of the human genome
6444821 we continue to seek further innovation to enable routine sequencing of genomes to advance scientific knowledge and healthcare
6444822 but i think within a few years its reasonable to say that this could end up being a diagnostic tool that would be a routine thing one could do in a doctors office its a real possibility
6444823 the unique ability of universities to attract intellectual resources and high quality personnel from around the world is a key element in fostering a competitive economic climate in quebec and canada
6444824 i was always keen to come back to mcgill but had assumed that the most competitive funding packages would be from u s schools
6444825 i wasnt at all sure that i could afford to come here without substantial support so for mcgill to come through with the funding necessary to keep me here was a pleasant surprise
6444826 new federal investment in graduate student support such as the vanier canada scholarships program introduced in the recent budget is a welcome partner program at the federal level that will leverage mcgills capacity and that of other canadian universities to attract and retain the best and brightest graduate students mcgills commitment to improving graduate student support for both canadian and international graduate students ensures that we will not lose our edge over the competition particularly amongst our institutional peers
6444827 the ideal fit for a graduate student in any program depends on a host of factors ranging from supervisory match to a comfortable standard of living and by enhancing the quality of its graduate funding capabilities mcgill has taken another crucial step in fuelling the canadian brain gain
6444828 when it comes to testicular cancer our health is quite literally in our hands theres a very high success rate of treatment for testicular cancer if its caught early enough self examination is crucial and i hope that these shower cards and posters will help remind men to have a quick check after a game work out or shower it could save their life
6444829 testicular cancer does not have to kill it can be treated if caught in time with 100 men being diagnosed every year with this form of cancer its clear that there is a great deal more that we can do to remind young men to regularly examine themselves by circulating posters and shower cards throughout leisure centres and sporting organisations in wales we hope to raise awareness of this important issue
6444830 prior research has suggested that the trend in strokes was increasing but our study shows declining incidence in stroke for non diabetic men both for first and recurrent stroke and in recurrent strokes in non diabetic women
6444831 the impressive decline in smoking and large decreases in cholesterol levels and to a lesser degree blood pressure levels in the population of northern sweden may have contributed to the declining incidence in both diabetic and non diabetic subjects over the study period
6444832 on the other hand we found more recurrent events among diabetic subjects than non diabetic subjects indicating a need for even more intensive secondary prevention among diabetic patients
6444833 the fact that patients with diabetes to a great extent had favorable time trends similar to those of non diabetics is particularly interesting considering that diabetic patients with heart attack from the same population did not show any positive trends over the 19 year study
6444834 todays report shows that the nhs is getting better and better at identifying people with diabetes and at supporting them to manage their condition
6444835 the next stage review made prevention a priority for the nhs and this is especially relevant to diabetes as a disease whose global increase in prevalence is partly a consequence of rising obesity
6444836 our vascular risk assessment programme putting prevention first is expected to prevent thousands of people developing diabetes each year and our strategy to tackle the rise in obesity will help many more reduce their risk of the disease
6444837 the nhs has responded impressively to the first five years of the national service framework more and more people with diabetes are getting good routine care and their outcomes are improving year on year
6444838 the next five years will continue to bring challenges for diabetes teams as they work to further improve diabetes services in both primary and secondary care
6444839 i look forward to working with the national diabetes support team and other key partners such as diabetes uk to support the nhs in driving further improvements in care for people with diabetes
6444840 everyone knows the province is facing capacity pressures and shortages of health care providers
6444841 the innovative nature of this project allows us to address both of these critical areas at the same time
6444842 this project will further enhance this vibrant health facility by promoting opportunities for the integration of health services and allowing healthcare providers to better work together to diagnose and treat patients

6444848 de problemen rond de amerikaanse hypotheekverstrekkers freddie mac en fanny mae zorgen voor veel onzekerheid onder beleggers
6444849 als gevolg van hun gekelderde aandelen kunnen ze bijna geen aandelenemissies meer doen daarnaast hebben ze een toenemend probleem om hun leningen te herfinancieren omdat de rente daarvan oploopt het wordt kortom steeds moeilijker voor deze bedrijven om normaal te functioneren en dit zorgt voor onrust op de financi le markten pas als deze onrust wordt weggenomen kunnen de markten weer omhoog gaan

6444852 im honoured to have been attacked by a spoon after all ive been attacking spoons for 55 years it is only right that finally a spoon should rebel against uri geller
6444853 my feet didnt touch the ground it is great to be published uri geller is a bit of a legend and i grew up watching him in the 1980s bending spoons
6444854 i just had the idea of what would happen if the spoon got its own back ive spoken to him a few times and he has been very supportive

6444857 i enjoy writing the story took about five minutes to write and i have been asked to contribute to the fourth black book of horror as well which is fantastic
6444858 since apples cannot be compared to oranges therefore the price of the phone remains unquestionable
6444859 in western countries the phone comes with a two year contractual obligation with the service provider wherein the whole price of the phone is recovered over the course of time
6444860 in india there is no such practice therefore we are collecting the entire cost at one go

6444863 on the one hand the crude inventory buildup was quite strong but the gasoline draw was also very prominent
6444864 before that meeting were going to get quite a few statements from opec officials expressing opinions in the end i dont expect a production cut but they may push for greater adherence to output quotas
6444865 terrified of allowing western countries to build any kind of cushion for the unexpected because it has the potential to return prices to normal or sustainable economic levels
6444866 the slide in the dollar has taken some of the wind out of the bears sail in the energy complex
6444867 as a result of continuing cost pressures the company made the decision subsequent to the end of the second quarter to suspend the underground mining operations at jerritt canyon effective august 8 in order to focus on developing a profitable mine plan that will enable jerritt canyon to return to profitability
6444868 the company has also been forced to shut down the mill in order to perform repair work on a critical part that malfunctioned in the drying circuit resulting in the lay off of the remaining workforce a professional engineering firm has been contracted to provide essential on site activities including ongoing environmental monitoring

6444872 ich denke im formel 1 kalender gibt es sicherere und auch wenig sichere kurse die fia und die organisatoren haben hier einen guten job gemacht
6444873 ich gebe wie immer alles und will so viele punkte holen wie m glich zuletzt waren wir etwas weiter hinter ferrari und mclaren als am anfang der saison der job ist schwerer geworden vor allem weil toyota und auch renault manchmal nahe an uns dran und manchmal auch schneller waren als wir es kann sich aber immer alles ndern also werden wir sehen

6444882 shes a mansfield girl who has gone to the top of the world and deserves it

6444901 we hebben gesmeekt en alles gedaan maar het was nee
6444902 dublin voorziet tegelijk dat elke lidstaat om humanitaire redenen kan beslissen om de asielzoeker niet door te sturen
6444903 ons land vertrekt vanuit de virtuele realiteit dat de kwaliteit van de asielprocedure en de opvang in elke eu lidstaat voldoende gegarandeerd is en dat we dus zonder probleem asielzoekers naar alle lidstaten kunnen doorsturen dit is evenwel pure fictie zoals blijkt uit internationale rapporten laat de situatie in landen als griekenland polen slowakije op het punt van bescherming en opvang vaak meer dan te wensen over
6444904 rijst bovendien de vraag of dvz onderzocht heeft of het uiteenrukken van het gezin conform het europees mensenrechtenverdrag is dat in zijn artikel 8 het recht op een gezinsleven garandeert
6444905 we think it will create a lot of excitement in downtown bay city this weekend
6444906 we encourage folks to come down and take a look for free
6444907 part of the reason we agreed to host the tall ships here is to remind people of our interest in developing a maritime heritage center

6444912 the local economy continues to struggle and more and more working families are losing their health coverage
6444913 this proposal will ensure that every legal bay county resident has access to basic health care
6444914 its a big part of the reason why were putting it on the ballot today and a big part of the reason why i think were going to win this campaign in november
6444915 i frankly was leaning against the idea because i just didnt know enough about it and i didnt know if the taxpayers would support such a thing
6444916 i did that and came away from that meeting committed to this specific proposal because of the kinds of people it was going to help working class folks whove done everything right but for whatever reason simply dont have health care through their jobs
6444917 i think we still have to focus on addressing health care nationally because as we see annually when we look at our budget health care is the biggest challenge that we have that we cannot control the escalation of those costs
6444918 vous navez jamais r v que tous les objets figuratifs qui se trouvent chez vous prennent vie lorsque vous avez le dos tourn

6444952 secondly many existing toll shareholders are unlikely to be long term holders in airlines regardless of virgins short term prospects which would suggest a substantial dumping of shares in the short term
6444953 we expect to take that momentum into the 2008 09 year
6444954 uncertainties about the value of the australian dollar and other currencies rising raw materials costs oil prices and global economic conditions
6444955 i think its a messy set of accounts that comes out of the accounting process of putting the two together in a market where the zinc price has fallen 40 per cent in aussie dollars in the last year copper has come off a bit and the aussie dollar has strengthened in the last six months
6444956 we cant win it trust back overnight but we have to make a start and we have to deliver consistently on what we say
6444957 even with conservative estimates theres potential for plenty of gas fired power stations in australia
6444958 of those 80 million homeowners only 55 million have a mortgage at all and 51 million are doing what is necessary working a second job skipping a vacation and managing their budgets to make their payments on time that leaves us with a puzzling situation how could 4 million mortgages cause this much trouble for us all
6444959 i have not been asked to leave i have not resigned nor given notice
6444960 i will crawl over cut glass to stay in australia and i am looking at all offers from a variety of industries i came to lend lease six years ago with a five year plan i approached the board of directors a year ago and said they should start to look for a successor that may take a month or six months i am happy to stay and work to keep creating value for lend lease shareholders

6444964 id like to see a doctor whos t shirt or at least a reference to doctor who
6444965 what we have worked very hard to do is clean up the portfolio
6444966 the market needs to know that they have a direct exposure to the funds assets
6444967 weve got to be absolutely focused on delivering the organic growth of these businesses
6444968 it gives me great pleasure to say that nab will be pleased to announce an interest rate cut should the reserve cut
6444969 nothing would give me greater pleasure than to go down 50 basis points
6444970 i think the biggest pressure i got was from my hairdresser three days ago as he was cutting my hair i realised he had a very very sharp blade in his hand and i realised id better give him the right answer
6444971 for the avoidance of any doubt mr clarke has not resigned given notice or been terminated

6444983 we have more deer in southern lower michigan than in the northern lower peninsula and u p combined
6444984 we want to see that herd reduced and the best way to do it is to reduce the adult female population
6444985 theres a lot of concern about transmission between deer and cattle
6444986 wed rather err on the side of caution when we get new cases like this
6444987 its awful early i dont begrudge anyone the chance to hunt but i hope guys arent planning to fill five permits in five days
6444988 weve already got hunting seasons running oct 1 to jan 1
6444989 thats 90 days between bow rifle and muzzleloading seasons now with the youth hunt and this new hunt we have about 100 days to hunt do the deer really need that much pressure
6444990 because we dont think the region should represent that high a number
6444991 deer seasons the farthest thing from my mind sept 18
6444992 how do you hunt when its 75 degrees the meat goes bad if you dont ice it or process it within an hour or two
6444993 i got caught off guard last year with the youth hunt and i ran out of supplies
6444994 i never predicted that many kids would hunt this time ill be ready for both
6444995 ministarstvo unutarnjih poslova ju ne osetije okupilo je te ljude i stavilo pod svoju za titu
6444996 clearly conditions tightened as we came towards the end of the financial year and that tightening has continued in the new financial year
6444997 we have not much visibility at all in terms of what advertising markets will do in this half or into the new year
6444998 eke out every dollar of the assets that we have
6444999 if we find opportunities to reduce costs we will act on them

6445031 he and his neoconservative foreign policy types that he agreed with are one of the reasons that george w bush decided to go to iraq
6445032 im sure he mccain loves his country its just that loving your country and lying to the american people are apparently not inconsistent in his view

6445059 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6445060 senator mccain was in a motorcade led by the united states secret service and held in a green room with no broadcast feed
6445061 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
6445062 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6445063 that room was totally free with no monitors a flat out lie
6445064 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because that what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
6445065 a motorist survey this year by the rubber manufacturers association found that 85 percent of american drivers do not properly check tire inflation pressure this is an alarming statistic since tires are the only part of a vehicle in contact with the road and a critical vehicle safety component
6445066 drivers across the u s can battle rising gas prices by simply maintaining proper tire inflation
6445067 current statistics indicate that 82 million vehicles have under inflated tires which means more rubber is hitting the road and accordingly miles per gallon is lessened in fact tire experts speculate that 2 8 billion gallons of gas is wasted by u s drivers each year simply because theyre driving on under inflated tires
6445068 the chps traffic safety commitment extends to safety campaigns like these which aim to reduce needless fatalities and injuries on california highways
6445069 our research shows that this improper inflation issue has been prevalent for years

6445072 he made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops
6445073 obama had no intention of bringing any cameras with him i was there i can vouch for that
6445074 i could not vote for an atheist because an atheist says i dont need god

6445096 the polls show 25 percent of her supporters have not gotten on board
6445097 hes got to be very concerned by the neck in neck polls and by what happened at saddleback
6445098 over the last week weve seen sen obamas lead in the poll of polls cut in half
6445099 this change was likely driven by a renewed focus on foreign policy after russias invasion of georgia as well as by sen mccains willingness to launch more aggressive attacks against obama on issues such as off shore drilling
6445100 since obama returned from his overseas trip it seems like mccain has thrown all the punches clearly the blows have landed in recent days obama is fighting back going after mccain on the economy the issue voters care about most mccain has changed the dynamic of the race heading into the two conventions that puts more pressure on obama to go to denver and effectively define himself and mccain
6445101 speaking to a cuban american audience in miami in august 2007 he said
6445102 we do have to crack down on those employers that are taking advantage of the situation
6445103 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6445104 one of the nicest places in the world to live in
6445105 one of the worst decisions in the history of this country
6445106 no i didnt no no sometimes im given to a little hyperbole
6445107 yesterday he obama suggested we put air in our tires to save on gas my friends lets do that but do you think thats enough to break our dependence on middle eastern oil i dont think so
6445108 we can do that decrease our dependence as a nation we can turned out sic the lights five minutes earlier we dont have to drive the extra block
6445109 im proud of that record from fighting for the recognition of doctor martin luther kings birthday in my state to sponsoring specific legislation that would prevent discrimination
6445110 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6445111 senator mccain was in a motorcade led by the united states secret service and held in a green room with no broadcast feed
6445112 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
6445113 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6445114 iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union they dont pose any serious threat to us
6445115 if that strategy made sense and would lead ultimately to the pullout of u s troops but in the short term required additional troop strength to protect those who are already on the ground then thats something i would support
6445116 given the situation on the ground i think if we had our troops out in four years that would be an extraordinary accomplishment
6445117 well obviously its going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues and jerusalem will be part of those negotiations
6445118 what the world should interpret is my consistent position which is i believe in trade
6445119 i just want to make sure that the rules of the road apply to everybody and they are fair and that they reflect the interests of workers and not just corporate profits
6445120 i said well i would always reserve the right to go in and strike against al qaeda if they were in iraq so ya know this is how politics works mccain thought that he could make a clever point by saying well let me give you some news barack al qaeda is in iraq like i wasnt reading the papers like i like i didnt know what was going on
6445121 well first of all i do know that al qaeda is in iraq thats why ive said we should continue to strike al qaeda targets but i have some news for john mccain and that is that there was no such thing as al qaeda in iraq until george bush and john mccain decided to invade iraq
6445122 i intend to bring it to an end so that we can actually start going after al qaeda in afghanistan and in the hills of pakistan like we should have been doing in the first place thats the news john mccain
6445123 when we talked back in november of 04 after your election i said theres been enormous speculation about your political future
6445124 i will serve out my full six year term you know tim if you get asked enough sooner or later you get weary and you start looking for new ways of saying things but my thinking has not changed
6445125 so you will not run for president or vice president in 2008
6445126 i happen to be a proponent of single payer universal healthcare coverage thats what id like to see
6445127 i never said that we should try to go ahead and get single payer healthcare
6445128 he gets an asterisk that says he is trying to be different but overall the same wealthy interests are funding his campaign as are funding other candidates whether or not they are lobbyists
6445129 a ccording to the center for responsive politics 14 of obamas top 20 contributors employed lobbyists this year spending a total of 16 2 million to influence the federal government in the first six months of 2007
6445130 contrary to the claims of some i have no interest in sitting down with our adversaries just for the sake of talking but as president of the united states i would be willing to lead tough and principled diplomacy with the appropriate iranian leaders at a time and place of my choosing if and only if it can advance the interests of the united states
6445131 w ould you be willing to meet separately without precondition during the first year of your administration in washington or anywhere else with the leaders of iran syria venezuela cuba and north korea in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries
6445132 i would and the reason is this that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration is ridiculous
6445133 senator youve said before that youd meet with president ahmadinejad
6445134 yeah nothings changed with respect to my belief that strong countries and strong presidents talk to their enemies and talk to their adversaries i find many of president ahmadinejads statements odious and ive said that repeatedly and i think that we have to recognize that there are a lot of rogue nations in the world that dont have american interests at heart but what i also believe is that as john f kennedy said we should never negotiate out of fear but we should never fear to negotiate
6445135 sen obamas nod to lowering corporate taxes comes as republicans have been attacking him for proposals that would raise the cost of doing business such as his pledge to raise the tax rate on capital gains and his vow to increase the top income tax rates which are often used by small unincorporated enterprises he didnt say how deeply he would cut the rate but said it could be trimmed in return for reducing corporate tax breaks simplifying the tax system
6445136 one other issue thats of great importance here in the district as well is gun control you said in idaho recently im quoting here i have no intention of taking away folks guns but you support the d c handgun ban
6445137 barack obama aligned himself with welfare reform on monday launching a television ad which touts the way the overhaul slashed the rolls by 80 percent obama leaves out however that he was against the 1996 federal legislation which precipitated the caseload reduction
6445138 i dont think that we can take nuclear power off the table

6445141 under this compromise legislation an important tool in the fight against terrorism will continue it does however grant retroactive immunity and i will work in the senate to remove this provision so that we can seek full accountability for past offenses so i support the compromise but do so with a firm pledge that as president i will carefully monitor the program review the report by the inspectors general and work with the congress to take any additional steps i deem necessary to protect the lives and the liberty of the american people
6445142 senator whats your reaction to the supreme courts decision today striking down the death penalty for a child rapist
6445143 i disagree with the decision i have said repeatedly that i think that the death penalty should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes i think that the rape of a small child 6 or 8 years old is a heinous crime and if a state makes a decision that under narrow limited well defined circumstances the death penalty is at least potentially applicable that that does not violate our constitution now i think its you know had the supreme court said we want to constrain the ability of the states to do this to make sure that its done in a careful and appropriate way that would have been one thi ng but it basically had a blanket prohibition and i disagreed with that decision
6445144 i am happy to have a debate with john mccain and george bush about foreign policy if john mccain wants to meet me anywhere anytime to have a debate about our respective policies in iraq iran the middle east or around the world that is a conversation i am happy to have because i believe that there is no separation between john mccain and george bush when it comes to our middle east policy and i think their policy has failed
6445145 sen obama has looked at this issue he recognizes that americans are suffering that we have a unique situation with rising gas prices and this is one occasion where we need to look at this strategically and
6445146 i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency
6445147 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
6445148 i made a general point about the fact that we need to provide the american people some relief and that there has been constructive conversations between republicans and democrats in the senate on this issue
6445149 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6445150 if weve got a plan on the table that i think meets the goals that america has to set and there are some things in there that i dont like then obviously thats something that i would consider because thats the nature of how we govern in a democracy
6445151 when im president i intend to keep in place the moratorium here in florida and around the country that prevents oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
6445152 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6445153 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6445154 there was a nightlife you couldnt see from the streets
6445155 they were off to the side in bright satin dresses one red one blue

6445157 these groups that lived on the fringe could have resorted to them to protect themselves communicate away from public view who knows what else
6445158 im hearing that from a lot of people but we just dont know yet

6445197 gold when in very small particles becomes very active under sunlight
6445198 the electromagnetic field of the sunlight can couple with the oscillations of the electrons in the gold particles and creates a resonance
6445199 the magnetic field on the surface of the gold nanoparticles can be enhanced by up to hundred times which breaks apart the pollutant molecules in the air
6445200 this technology is solar powered and is very energy efficient because only the particles of gold heat up

6445228 whilst the deadline has passed for miners to lodge claims there are still many claims awaiting settlement some of which may take up to two years before a successful conclusion is reached therefore the site is still critical for solicitors to continue to track the progress of any outstanding claims it is now updated by capita who administer the services for berr providing information such as requests for more health information for each miner progress on claims and the details of the claims settlements
6445229 the big challenge for the team here at wtg was that we were dealing with a service coming close to the end of its lifecycle we had to deal with end users of the site who were used to the way it works but were migrating from entering claims to their management through the process of settlement the fact that we are able to ensure that the servers and software are supported and maintained for the life of the project while ensuring that solicitors can still access the information for their clients means that we were able to deliver against objective and budget

6445243 with over one third of it departments likely to have one or more environmental criteria in their top six buying criteria in 2010 it makes good business sense too

6445262 database archiving often fails to get the attention it needs compared to other critical activities related to production databases and data warehouses
6445263 an archival system becomes critical when you need to access archived information in response to a legal summons customer service issue security investigation or technical issue the value of archiving grows considerably as it becomes easier to access the archived data
6445264 with legal demands for access growing conventional approaches to database archiving are increasingly being found lacking they focus on lifting and shifting inactive data from production databases to improve application performance without considering how to optimize the way archived data is stored get your archiving right and you reduce storage costs and guarantee simple future proofed access get it wrong and at worst you could face prison
6445265 why database archiving should be part of your dbms strategy
6445266 it managers need to achieve a balance between the compliance demands for retention and the business demand for economical storage and retrieval current database management system technology is optimised for transactional processing data warehouses are optimised for analytics but both fail to adequately address archiving needs worse still the lines between archive stores and backup which have very different drivers and requirements are all too often blurred
6445267 forresters research clearly illustrates the need for the new generation of archive stores these deliver both massive reductions in storage footprints through data compression together with the security immutability and point in time query capability that enables quick simple and unimpeachable fulfilment of regulatory obligations

6445287 the negotiators have made really good progress they are satisfied with where they are

6445308 mccain has worked hard to take his case to the people and draw this election into a real challenge and a real fight
6445309 if you look at the raw partisan numbers it might suggest that senator obama is not doing quite as well as you would think
6445310 obama presented thoughtful answers as if he was in a conversation or at a seminar
6445311 on the other hand you dont want a president who is hamlet who cant decide anything mccain spoke in bumper stickers
6445312 voters are looking for change that gives obama a real advantage in this election even as mccain tries to invent himself
6445313 im a big believer in winning i dont intend to lose this election john mccain doesnt know what hes up against right now
6445314 obamas ace in the hole however is his ability to change the electorate modeling even a modest increase in youth turnout generates a two point lead for obama

6445349 examination of the coach is ongoing and officers are beginning to interview the coachs passengers

6445351 id like to reiterate my thanks to local residents for their support and assistance this week i also want to express my thanks to alton towers staff who offered shelter and first aid to dozens of the traumatised passengers and arranged transport home for them

6445353 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail

6445360 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
6445361 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

6445371 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
6445372 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
6445373 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
6445374 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
6445375 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
6445376 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones

6445645 regardless of the time of day or night regardless of the day of the week and despite the presumable differences in network congestion during prime time and non prime time hours of use
6445646 my neighborhood would have to be under the same amount of congestion for 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year

6445657 it was well known that mr tenenbaum was jewish lived his religious beliefs and by his actions appeared to have a close affinity for israel

6445659 as i watched her i wanted to make muslim womens lives more comfortable and bring them out of the closet
6445660 im really happy to be studying the language of my ancestors
6445661 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6445662 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6445663 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6445664 the negotiators have taken this very very far but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6445665 obviously the american forces are here coalition forces are here at the invitation of the iraqi government
6445666 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people respects iraqs sovereignty
6445667 but the goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
6445668 that is the goal and that has been the goal from the beginning
6445669 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6445670 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6445671 really we are very very close to closing this agreement
6445672 and as we said from the beginning there is no hidden agenda here
6445673 but really we are redoubling our efforts to bring this to a successful conclusion
6445674 we as the sadr movement denounce this dubious visit and such timing we reaffirm our stance of rejecting the long term agreement we demand the iraqi government and on the highest levels not to sign this unjust agreement and we demand the withdrawal of the government as soon as possible
6445675 the pullback of russian forces is taking place at such a tempo that by the end of august 22 they will be in the zones of responsibility of russian peacekeepers

6445688 we tested there a while ago but it was only half a day and the other teams including yamaha and suzuki have also been testing there so we should be quite equal in that respect i think the competition at the front will be the same as usual
6445689 in the past this has not been a good track for hm plant honda and the ducatis have gone well there but the bike is running well with some changes we made at knockhill so i cant see any reason why we cant be up there challenging again for the win or the double

6445693 these vocs create that new smell as they are slowly released from walls and furniture but they along with methanol and carbon monoxide are not good for your health even in small amounts
6445694 gold when in very small particles becomes very active under sunlight
6445695 the electromagnetic field of the sunlight can couple with the oscillations of the electrons in the gold particles and creates a resonance
6445696 the magnetic field on the surface of the gold nanoparticles can be enhanced by up to hundred times which breaks apart the pollutant molecules in the air
6445697 this technology is solar powered and is very energy efficient because only the particles of gold heat up
6445698 in conventional chemical reactions you heat up everything which is a waste of energy
6445699 once this technology can be applied to produce specialty chemicals at ambient temperature it heralds significant changes in the economy and environmental impact of the chemical production

6445717 the two americans dropped to their knees hugged rolled around in the sand and came off looking like glazed doughnuts in two piece bathing suits
6445718 i saw the horse tests before competition and therefore i can say that the horses performed excellently it wasnt matter of any horse because the strong rain made the ground very very heavy very deep and very slippery some of the athletes who are not so strong in riding were very afraid on the ground and when they were jumping
6445719 we will have a meeting now with the management about the competition tomorrow if there is some more rain we may have to do something about reducing the height of the obstacles whatever we will have to see
6445720 when i saw then the horses in the preliminaries i knew it was going to be difficult i feel really sorry for svoboda who deserved a medal to be honest the horses werent good enough for the olympic games
6445721 there are three factors the quality of the course the quality of the horses and the quality of the riders ideally you would want one or two to go clear i think the crowd might have spooked one or two but our two riders handled the horses very well

6445761 we have invested in recruitment and into increasing client visits by 54 percent for this quarter we made 42 000 client visits
6445762 in recent decades the doctrine of creation had almost disappeared from theology it was almost imperceptible
6445763 we are now aware of the damage that this has caused if we do not proclaim god in his full grandeur as creator and as redeemer we also diminish the value of the redemption
6445764 it is he the creator himself who did and can enter into history and operate in it precisely because he is the god of the whole and not only of a part if we recognize this it will obviously follow that the redemption being christian and simply christian faith also means responsibility always and everywhere with regard to creation
6445765 as long as the earth was seen as gods creation the task of subduing it was never intended as an order to enslave it but rather as the task of being guardians of creation and developing its gifts of actively collaborating in gods work ourselves in the evolution that he ordered in the world so that the gifts of creation might be appreciated rather than trampled upon and destroyed
6445766 the brutal consumption of creation begins where god is not where matter is henceforth only material for us where we ourselves are the ultimate demand where the whole is merely our property and we consume it for ourselves alone
6445767 and the wasting of creation begins when we no longer recognize any need superior to our own but see only ourselves
6445768 i think therefore that true and effective initiatives to prevent the waste and destruction of creation can be implemented and developed understood and lived only where creation is considered as beginning with god
6445769 today is a day of an important decision for me
6445770 when i assumed charge nine years ago the country was about to be branded a failed state and a terrorist state he asid assumed charge with the aim of rescuing the country in the last nine years i have tried my best to serve the country to the best of my ability during confrontation with india 9 11 and its aftermath and the devastating earthquake in all these crises we stood up thanks to the grace of gof and saved pakistan from the crises in handling the problems the sole aim was the well being of the people and the safety and security of pakistan i have taken part in two wars which pakistan fought the coalition government they deceived the people never did they realize that they may win against me but how adversely the contry was affected did not concern them economic decline and energy crisis were experiencing is being attributed to my policies i would like to put some facts before the nation especially the economy the economy was doing well in fact very well before deb 2007 he gdp growth was 7 percent revenue collection had reached one trillion dollars the kse index was around 15 000 points all these indicators are of eight months ago pakistans economy was poised to take off how did the economic probkem start all of a sudden why has the stock exchange lost 5 000 points why has the rupee lost almost 30 percent of its value surely the present economic crisis is owing to rising oil prices and similar other developments on a global basis but it is wholly incorrect to put blame on these global factors alone it is our own failures during the last 8 months power sector we were producing 14 000 mw in june 2007 but are now producing just about 10 000 mw why in a nutshell the people are being fooled let us now look forward to find solutions to take the country out of the woods during the past nine years we addressed all sectors and accelerated development in the country in these 9 years we constructed several roads and bypasses and worked on several other developmental projects you can see for yourself how much we have done including all the dams that have been constructed such as the mirani dam several canals are also being constructed these developments will help irrigate 3 million acre fields in the country there was massive industrialisation during the last nine years there was a lot done for higher education nice universities from different foreign countries had agreed to set up campuses in the country in the health sector primary and secondary healthcare was given priority safe drinking water was a sector that was addressed on priority and 6000 water purification plants were set up women were given political empowerment and now you see a lot more women in eh assemblies honour killing was discouraged and hudood ordinance laws were revamped the minorities were given opportunities and culture and heritage was given due importance democracy we incorporated the essence of democracy into the system through a highly progressive local bodies system anyone harming it will harm pakistan we held two successful general elections global image we introduced pakistans true image all over the world which proves the success of our policies im proud of all the achievements if you look at the donors conference we were given 6 5 billion dollars in donations when we needed 5 billion ill come to the current economic scenario now from the beginning i wanted to create a reconciliatory atmosphere in pakistans politics on a personal and institutional level i talked about the 3 phase transition to democracy in pakistan the third phase was achieved last year when i doffed my uniform and held free and fair elections in pakistan after the elections people had hopes from their leaders in the govt pakistanis have been looking forward toward prosperity and stability in the political atmosphere is unfortunate my appeals to strive for reconciliation and a resolution of economic issues facing the people went unheeded some sections of the political forces chose confrontation rather than reconciliation the presidents office was accused of conspiring against the new democratic setup you should remember it was i who held free and fair elections look at the pms election the coalition setup in sindh the opposition cooperated with the govt in getting the budget passed i have publicly announced my support to the govt i have offered the govt my services unfortunately the coalition govt thinks me a problem and wants to impeach what are they scared of and why do they want to do this impeachment and chargesheet is the right of the parliament and i have the right to defend myself against these charges i am confident that no charge can be proved against me all my actions were for the good of the people and the country all my major decisions were the consent of all concerned and all stake holders e g services bureaucracy civil society etc i am not at all worried about the charge sheet because nothing can be proved but the larger issue is what isit going to cost pakistan its economy political and social order honour and prestige of the highest office of the state such are the considerations upper most in my mind whether im impeached or not the countrys stability will be compromised the office of the president will also be insulted pakistan is my love now and always my life is for pakistan i have defended and will continue to defend pakistan i want to be able to bring pakistan out of the current crisis so i think perhaps should do something but i also do not want to do something that may generate uncertainty in the country i also want to save the parliament from horse trading even if the impeachment is defeated the relations between the presidents office and the coalition govt will not heal institutions will be endangered therefore with this situation in view and having consulted my legal and political advisors i have decided to resign from my post i have decided to resign from the office of president and my resignation will be handed over to the speaker of the national assembly i want the people to be the judges and let them decide my fate i am a human being and may have committed follies

6445859 the russians have driven us from our homes and now we end up as refugees here in a building that used to be the base for russian soldiers serving in the caucasus it is an irony of fate
6445860 things are not so bad here but we all just want to go home as soon as the russians leave
6445861 we escaped with our car and left everything else behind this is my lovely house we dont know if or when we will see it again
6445862 we had to leave my mother in law behind she is 80 we dont even know if she is still alive
6445863 we dont know if our house is still standing because everybody in our village fled
6445864 we cant live here we have water and food but we sleep on the floor there is no gas or electricity so we cant even cook the rice and pasta they provide
6445865 this is genocide and russia is to blame we are a small democratic country and russia is the aggressor

6445877 we will be adding additional members to our board of directors and strategic advisory committee these will be individuals whose broad business backgrounds include executive positions in the insurance industry their collective experience will help us to maintain our planned growth both internally as well as by acquisition
6445878 we are now starting to accelerate the stepping stones that will be the foundation for a carefully crafted business plan that should be successful in any economic climate we want to offer current and potential shareholders a strong return on their investments and we believe that will come from our core pet insurance business as well as the anticipated acquisition of related revenue generating products and services as those opportunities arise

6445885 heavens getting pretty close to full today and ive been asked to admit only people who have had particularly horrible deaths so whats your story
6445886 well for a while ive suspected my wife has been cheating on me so today i came home early to try to catch her red handed as i came into my 25th floor apartment i could tell something was wrong but all my searching around didnt reveal where this other guy could have been hiding finally i went out to the balcony and sure enough there was this man hanging off the railing 25 floors above ground by now i was really mad so i started beating on him and kicking him but wouldnt you know it he wouldnt fall off so finally i went back into my apartment and got a hammer and starting hammering on his fingers of course he couldnt stand that for long so he let go and fell but even after 25 stories he fell into the bushes stunned but okay i couldnt stand it anymore so i ran into the kitchen grabbed the fridge and threw it over the edge where it landed on him killing him instantly but all the stress and anger got to me and i had a heart attack and died there on the balchoy
6445887 its been a very strange day you see i live on the 26th floor of my apartment building and every morning i do my exercises out on my balcony well this morning i must have slipped or something because i fell over the edge but i got lucky and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me i knew i couldnt hang on for very long when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony i thought for sure i was saved when he started beating on me and kicking me i held on the best i could until he ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands finally i just let go but again i got lucky and fell into the bushes below stunned but all right just when i was thinking i was going to be okay this refrigerator comes falling out of the sky and crushes me instantly and now im here

6445900 voters want to see a sense of urgency and outrage in their president outrage over our dependence on foreign oil outrage over our increased cost of living health care and education outrage over declining incomes outrage over an endless war and an idiotic foreign policy and outrage over our countrys loss of prestige over the last 7 1 2 years
6445901 gathering comprehensive data about the dead from civilians is a time consuming task
6445902 we have to cross check data and check that people are not misidentified or miscounted
6445903 we have to make sure there is no double counting if a body is moved we have to be careful not to count it twice maybe it is counted once in the village itself and then it could be counted again in the city morgue
6445904 to get really accurate figures you would really have to go to every single village
6445905 we do take allegations of arrests of people missing or reported dead we can also offer our services to the authorities for the transfer of mortal remains
6445906 all the work we do is gathering confidential information which we share with the authorities with the aim of finding out the location of loved ones for the civilian population
6445907 there has been a lot of controversy about the russian figures
6445908 when that figure came out of 1 500 dead it wasnt very helpful it didnt provide any sourcing or methodology there were no details about how the figure was calculated we certainly cant confirm it
6445909 the problem here is that when russia puts out a figure like that it does two things it distracts attention from where there are violations and from the real scale of what is happening
6445910 if you have a military objective then the grad rocket is not a targeted weapon civilians are going to get hit and that is exactly what happened and happened on a significant scale the proximity was such that it was indiscriminate
6445911 the rule is that disproportionate attacks are prohibited in other words if you have your eye on a military target and there is likely to be civilian damage excessive in relation to the expected military gain you dont fire
6445912 we have numerous stories of ossetian forces roving around ethnic georgian villages running around looting homes torching them
6445913 we are looking into other accounts of violence of people being robbed at gunpoint these are areas that russian forces have control over it is their responsibility to protect them

6445929 en coca cola no hemos recortado el presupuesto publicitario de momento pero s estamos adaptando las campa as a la situaci n actual con optimismo queremos comunicar que los momentos felices no dependen de si hay crisis o no
6445930 hay que a adir el cambio en el mercado de la comunicaci n provocado por el desarrollo de internet y por la aplicaci n de las nuevas tecnolog as
6445931 soportes que comuniquen y capten a la audiencia que deseamos con el fin de mantener a los consumidores emocionalmente enganchados a la marca
6445932 a n no hay ejemplos definitivos de anuncios que mencionan la recesi n pero supongo que se empezar n a aplicar despu s del verano cuando el espa ol se incorporar plenamente a afrontar psicol gicamente la crisis wendys o ikea en su momento fueron buenos ejemplos con sus mensajes t tienes menos para gastar pero no significa que vayas a comer menos o el pa s tiene una recesi n no significa que t la tengas
6445933 los chicos ya casi no ven la tele hay que llegar a ellos de otra forma
6445934 pero el n mero de canales se multiplic estaba internet hab amos perdido notoriedad nuestro anuncio triunfaba cuando hab a pocos canales y asegurabas que toda espa a lo ve a
6445935 m s que saturaci n de publicidad lo que hay es saturaci n de productos
6445936 los espa oles han perdido la inocencia ante la publicidad pero sta tambi n ha perdido la suya ha pasado de intentar convencer a la gente de que compre algo a establecer relaciones con esa gente
6445937 es verdad que los j venes son m s sofisticados m s interactivos pero no han levantado m s barreras
6445938 antes yo les dec a con un micr fono a los j venes bebe coca cola y eso ahora no les gusta
6445939 son muy interactivos muy exigentes se comunican por internet se organizan y son capaces de arruinar una marca
6445940 tenemos m s ingresos y m s tiempo de preocuparnos por la responsabilidad social corporativa es lo que ahora le exigimos a las empresas

6445942 no es de extra ar que nuestra percepci n de la belleza est distorsionada
6445943 sirve para crear imagen m s que para las ventas
6445944 nunca antes la publicidad fue tan creativa pero nunca tan ineficaz
6445945 todo eso de la publicidad viral no funciona se ha banalizado el mensaje la notoriedad busca entretener perfecto pero se trata de subir las ventas
6445946 no crecieron las adquisiciones del carta nevada pero s de otros cavas de mayor precio el anuncio no pretend a subir ventas sino cambiar la imagen de la compa a a largo plazo y captar al p blico joven
6445947 la mitad de las compras de los productos especialmente dirigidos a los ni os que realiza el adulto se hacen teniendo en cuenta sus preferencias
6445948 la clave para relacionarse de forma eficiente con el ni o consumidor es considerarlo en su singularidad forzar esa mirada el ni o consumidor no es un adulto peque o necesita de una aproximaci n diferente y huir de la creencia que considera menos graves los errores con ni os por su especial capacidad para recuperarse y olvidar
6445949 la identificaci n de sectores exclusivamente infantiles con especial atenci n a los mercados de la moda alimentaci n juguete tradicional y videojuegos
6445950 crear experiencias y vivencias de compras inolvidables para los ni os y sus familias los vincula emocionalmente con las marcas y les otorga valores a adidos la diferenciaci n de una marca del resto de sus competidoras y puede depender m s de una estrategia de distribuci n brillante que de otra basada en novedades relativas del producto
6445951 en general a los ni os les gusta la publicidad y la recuerdan en este sentido los medios on line pueden ofrecer a las marcas numerosas ventajas ya que por un lado para alcanzar a un ni o cada vez m s ocupado con actividades extraescolares el uso exclusivo de los medios de comunicaci n tradicionales no garantiza una cobertura elevada
6445952 podemos concluir que existen muchos elementos comunes en ambos sexos y que en el futuro existir una tendencia a generar productos h bridos o neutros pues la reducci n de la edad del juego y la disminuci n de potenciales consumidores forzar n a los fabricantes a buscar vol menes m s significativos
6445953 los nuevos emplazamientos otorgar n a los anunciantes nuevas opciones y significativos espacios para los anuncios a la par que resultan tiles y no intrusivos
6445954 la publicidad de facebook y microsoft siempre ha convivido en armon a en el sitio

6445967 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6445968 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues

6445970 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6445971 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6445972 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6445973 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend

6445980 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6445981 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6445982 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6445983 the negotiators have taken this very very far but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6445984 obviously the american forces are here coalition forces are here at the invitation of the iraqi government
6445985 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people respects iraqs sovereignty
6445986 but the goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
6445987 that is the goal and that has been the goal from the beginning
6445988 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6445989 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6445990 really we are very very close to closing this agreement
6445991 and as we said from the beginning there is no hidden agenda here
6445992 but really we are redoubling our efforts to bring this to a successful conclusion
6445993 we as the sadr movement denounce this dubious visit and such timing we reaffirm our stance of rejecting the long term agreement we demand the iraqi government and on the highest levels not to sign this unjust agreement and we demand the withdrawal of the government as soon as possible

6446034 our country and the united states will be more secure
6446035 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around

6446044 este tema lleg a anep y acordamos que estas medidas requer an de m s an lisis no es que no hubiera un acuerdo sobre que es necesario resolver el problema en lo que no hubo acuerdo fue en la forma en que se estaba expresando
6446045 se hab an puesto medidas de una forma muy simplista para una problem tica mucho m s compleja como es la de vivienda de inter s social
6446046 se nos escaparon unas medidas en la ltima discusi n que fueron discutidas y no hubo unanimidad por alg n error que no entiendo d nde estuvo no fueron f sicamente eliminadas del borrador final del informe
6446047 al notar que fueron incluidas fue que hubo una petici n de algunos de ellos el presidente de la c mara de comercio jorge daboub fue uno de ellos que dijo que esas medidas no estaban acordadas y no deb an estar en el documento es una de las reglas que hab amos seguido
6446048 sobre esas medidas hab a reserva pero se hab a dicho que se buscar an formas conciliatorias sobre c mo hacerlo por eso s se hab an incluido y se hab an tomado como acuerdo
6446049 pero si al final esas medidas no eran respaldadas pues en realidad eso quitarlas es lo que hab a que hacer no pod an ir medidas que no tuvieran el apoyo de todos
6446050 implican esfuerzos y sacrificios de todos los sectores representados y part cipes en la comisi n tristemente algunos indicios sugieren que estos esfuerzos y sacrificios est n siendo repartidos en forma sesgada especialmente buscando descargar toda la responsabilidad sobre el estado
6446051 las medidas tienen que involucrar sacrificios de todos medidas donde el sector empresarial tambi n se involucre para la soluci n de la crisis en aspectos por ejemplo como prestaciones laborales a los trabajadores y en materia de precios de los productos
6446052 en el tema del subsidio por ejemplo mantener el subsidio el ctrico es una responsabilidad que el gobierno asume pero no le toca al sector privado qu le toca al sector privado para nosotros mantener subsidio a las familias hay alguien a quien debe dejarse de pagar subsidios y ese alguien es la gran industria y el gran comercio esa es la parte de la cuota de sacrificio tambi n
6446053 vamos a ver qu pasa con estas medidas que quedaron fuera a ver si hay posibilidad de rescatarlas o ya no ah vamos a discutir cu l es el destino

6446066 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6446067 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6446068 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again

6446085 the business community and our university are stuck in a swamp
6446086 a depressingly large number of meetings with legislators began with a monologue about how all the states problems were caused by the policies and positions of the other party and how things would get better quickly if we just came out publicly in support of their own partys position
6446087 too often the tirades were accompanied by a warning of dire consequences if i spoke in public opposition to measures i felt would harm the university or a sharp rebuke if i had recently committed the sin of thanking a member of the opposite party for helping the university with some issue
6446088 until a couple of years ago i was also frequently warned or threatened about the need for

6446090 according to 2007 u s census bureau numbers wisconsin currently has the eleventh highest per
6446091 and lower taxation hasnt made the economies of tennessee and alabama any better in ways that benefit the citizens of those states
6446092 where in wmcs political agenda is there any acknowledgment of the singular importance of creating more high income jobs or any support for the things it takes to do that automatic wmc opposition to any proposed state regulation is also both outdated and contrary to the common sense views of most citizens and business leaders
6446093 if this isnt a wake up call for wmc members to get control of the political extremists on their staff i dont know what would qualify it pains me greatly to say this but i believe and many former wmc board members agree that wmc has somehow passively allowed itself to be hijacked by highly partisan ideologically driven staff wmc has evolved from being a strategically focused business organization to being a partisan political lobbying organization this combined with wmcs wealth and undeniable political influence and effectiveness has made wmc the single biggest driver of our toxic political environment and thus the single biggest obstacle to the recovery of wisconsins economy

6446108 since all computation takes both time and space in memory agents cannot possibly consider every option available to them at every instant in time
6446109 these egocentric sorts of actions may in turn result in modifying the agents basic behavioural capacities particularly in that updating memory implies some form of learning is possible
6446110 critics of this approach complain that it is too slow real time planning and that despite the proofs it is still unlikely to produce optimal plans because reducing descriptions of reality to dynamic reactive planning
6446111 the search problem is moved instead to the developers or learning system that creates the agents intelligence
6446112 however evaluation of the fuzzy conditions is much slower then evaluation of their discrete counterparts
6446113 but at any instant they produce a single action as a consequence of their current state and the state of the world they perceive
6446114 typically there is an input set of units which receives input from perceptual stimulation memory or drives and an output set of units which select an action to be performed
6446115 also the more complicated a network is the lower the probability that machine learning can successfully find optimal weights for it because of the combinatorial complexity of exploring the interactions of too many unrelated variables this is ironic since adaptation should in theory save development time but it is empirically true tyrrell 1993
6446116 it is based on superposition of attractive and repulsive forces that effect on the agent
6446117 the advantage of steering is that it is computationally very efficient
6446118 of course anytime planning still suffers from combinatorial complexity but the algorithms are carefully designed such that a best guess at a solution is always available but if more time is given a solution that is at least as good probably better will be offered
6446119 leverage voice hd audio presence identity and corporate security technologies to bring boring conference calls to life in a virtual world within the security of each corporations own network

6446121 we evaluated a number of approaches and ultimately found diamondware to have not only the most effective but also the most mature and scalable system expertise and technology in this domain
6446122 we worked closely with them and demonstrated their technology as an element of our overall system based on exceptional feedback from early customers and great technical interaction we concluded that an acquisition made sense to accelerate our move to these new immersive clients and environments for the new communications world all of their technical expertise and capability which goes beyond spatial audio is in line with our vision and strategy of creating better more realistic and more useful communications and collaborative experiences as communications and it converge again very consistent with the overall vision of the company
6446123 outset contemporaryart fund is very pleased to facilitate an auction that will provide vital support for nspcc therapeutic and treatment centres across the uk by bringing together galleries artists and collectors within the design community outset is strongly committed to nspccs service which last year provided vital therapy to more than 2 000 children with over 70 of this therapy delivered via art workshops and related programmes in its mission to support new art the charitable foundation has used art extensively over the last six years to engage with education therapy and outreach projects across the uk and abroad in 2007 a total of six treatment and therapeutic centres were fully funded by outset led initiatives and we hope that the design communitys enthusiasm for design makes a difference leads to similar success this year

6446126 is the genius of american prison expansion having failed to make prisons effective we have learned to make them profitable
6446127 at the eastern oregon correctional institution inmates dont make license plates any more
6446128 they make money 6 25 an hour on average manufacturing casual clothing the prison here like prisons across america is turning itself into a for profit factory cashing in on a tight labor market
6446129 so this is going to breathe new life into our town
6446130 theyll have inmates working there for 25 or 50 cents an hour how is a local cabinet shop or tool maker supposed to compete with that kind of slave labor
6446131 but saying that is not good for business this industry depends on feeding itself it has to say theres a crisis
6446132 by 1995 under the mandatory minimum sentencing laws the average federal prison term served for selling crack cocaine was nearly 11 years
6446133 for homicide by comparison the national average was barely six
6446134 marketers of prison labor thats the best way to grow our prison population
6446135 but you now have enough businessmen and corrupt politicians with a financial interest in heightening the public perception of crime and expanding the prison industry

6446192 durch die b ndelung von transportauftr gen verschiedener logistikunternehmen zu gemeinsamen tourenpl nen l sst sich gegen ber der herk mmlichen vorgehensweise die anzahl der leerfahrten reduzieren was die staugefahr und die damit einhergehenden nachteile wie brennstoffmehrverbrauch und steigerung der fahrtzeiten mindert

6446247 in view of the shareholding pattern of mgl and the control that is apparently exercised by the government and the nature of the functions performed by them it leaves no room for doubt that it is a public authority
6446248 more than 50 per cent of the share capital in mgl is held by the government the functions discharged by the company are not private functions and therefore they cannot be regarded as a private individual engaged in a commercial activity
6446249 what is important is that the particular entity should have a monopolistic position and the nature of function being performed by it is of public nature

6446267 you have to put into consideration that if kids arent in school on fridays parents may need to send their children to day care
6446268 we need to have at least 180 days of school
6446269 if we taught four days instead five while keeping the same amount of hours each day we would need to continue school into the summer that wouldnt really make any difference in costs
6446270 by shutting down that means all air conditioners boilers lights electricity et cetera would be off
6446271 if the buildings are completely shut down the team couldnt play any games or even practice
6446272 its pretty clear that now its not an option for us
6446273 it would be almost impossible because of the state education law requiring 180 days of schooling

6446318 the vets who had a look at him were really surprised at how fast hed gone downhill
6446319 their advice to us was hes not going to last much longer hes suffering and you should take action
6446320 its a really tragic result from an operation that people worked really really hard on
6446321 youll notice that most of the faculties at the table are professional second entry level programs medicine started it because there werent enough black medical students there still arent so really this was an effort on their part to build that pool of applicants i think half of the black students in medicine now have come from the mentorship program its been enormously successful
6446322 eleven canadian african students graduated last year from the doctor of medicine program at u of t and seven were from the smp
6446323 we look forward to equalizing our numbers for aboriginal students

6446334 secondly for the first time the leaders of the pacific islands forum have embraced the possibility of suspension of a member state to be adopted against fiji should they continue not to embrace their undertakings for march 2009 elections

6446353 i hope im well rounded i run to the ball a good motor
6446354 travis is real explosive hes got a lot of power the cardinals scouts did a great job of finding him he has pass rush ability and in our system our outside guys first talent is outside rush ability the other thing we saw on tape is how strong he was in the run game
6446355 he really had a nice game showing that combination of power and pass rush
6446356 solidifies our belief hell be a good player for us needless to say we were excited to get travis in free agency we thought he would fit well defensively into our scheme
6446357 defensive football is a lot about matchups getting a guy like travis matched up against a back in pass protection or adrian wilson getting matched up on a back having guys who have those skills is going to give us a lot of flexibility
6446358 i am glad martz is gone and you can tell him i said it too
6446359 i think he played me he was not honest with me as a man or as a coach and my position coach wilbert montgomery didnt have anything to say either nobody was telling me stuff
6446360 playing for martz last year i hated it you dont understand how hurt i was sitting on the sidelines and not getting that many carries i mean i started the season with like 15 carries and then i got like five carries actually nine against minnesota i know they are a good run stop team but that shows you were scared of them that ticked me off how many starting running backs do you know get five carries in a game
6446361 why dont you get a new phone while were here

6446365 i figured the lines wouldnt be as long out there
6446366 but then you have to deal with getting to new jersey probably take you longer by the time youre done
6446367 we wanted the town to be aware of what our plans were and we wanted to bring as many people together so that we could communicate with you what our intentions are
6446368 i dont want to change this into waterbury or watertown i like the idea that it is rural i love bethlehem i always have
6446369 my father has done foster care i have gone with him on visits in public parks and its not a good location nothing seems to work right
6446370 these are people that got caught up in the system they are working very hard to get their families reunited and put back together and we want to assist this take some burden off the court system
6446371 we have the lake for children we have the soccer field for children we have flanders nature center it will be a mess this town is small we dont need all that kind of foot traffic all that vehicle traffic and its really going to take away from the integrity of our town
6446372 we just decided bethlehem was the first place to start because it was smallest and plus they have no zoning ordinances
6446373 its pretty sad to a certain degree since people were uninformed and jumping to conclusions at the same time
6446374 its just an informative it was very important to see how people felt but it was most important first to hear what the opposition was and then they could make their judgment based on fact
6446375 our contractor has already said we dont want to go by code we want to go a step further because we are going green when you help children you want the environment to prosper
6446376 there is an 800 pound gorilla in the room and hes got a big red z on his back and no one is seeing him but hes here and its got to be recognized
6446377 we all have your names and let me tell you the internet is wonderful and well know everything about the four you by tomorrow morning
6446378 i think its this time that is important to us to reassess the ordinance that we have in hand review zoning review the ordinance on septic and all applicable situations for land use
6446379 our ordinances are such that there may not be keeping up with the times
6446380 youve got to understand that times change and that situations change and we must be on top of this one of the problems that we recently had was with the dog situation because without zoning we didnt have any enforcement action to be taken

6446399 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6446400 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6446401 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6446402 the negotiators have taken this very very far but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6446403 obviously the american forces are here coalition forces are here at the invitation of the iraqi government
6446404 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people respects iraqs sovereignty
6446405 but the goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
6446406 that is the goal and that has been the goal from the beginning
6446407 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6446408 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6446409 really we are very very close to closing this agreement
6446410 and as we said from the beginning there is no hidden agenda here
6446411 but really we are redoubling our efforts to bring this to a successful conclusion
6446412 we as the sadr movement denounce this dubious visit and such timing we reaffirm our stance of rejecting the long term agreement we demand the iraqi government and on the highest levels not to sign this unjust agreement and we demand the withdrawal of the government as soon as possible

6446435 the internet is just a world passing around notes in a classroom
6446436 paling menarik tumpuan pastinya kemunculan artis terkenal tanah air menghiburkan penonton di lokasi terpilih dan kepada mereka yang menyaksikan menerusi siaran langsung di televisyen
6446437 persembahan diadakan berterusan merangkumi empat segmen meniti kemerdekaan menjelang kemerdekaan detik kemerdekaan dan finale yang diadakan serentak di dataran merdeka bukit bintang dan klcc
6446438 memang saya agak terkejut mendengar cerita itu dan pelik juga dari mana mereka mendapat berita itu setakat ini saya bersyukur dengan apa yang saya miliki dan jujurnya aset saya belum lagi sampai ke tahap itu
6446439 pastinya saya juga mengimpikan untuk mempunyai aset sebanyak itu untuk memiliki nilai aset sebesar itu ia mestilah dari usaha dan kerja keras kerana ia tidak akan datang bergolek insya allah mana tahu masin mulut anda semua dapatlah saya memiliki aset seperti yang dikatakan itu
6446440 alhamdulillah pihak saya iaitu siti nurhaliza productions sdn bhd snp sudah pun menyiapkan kertas kerjanya dan kami akan berusaha untuk mencari penaja bagi merealisasikan konsert ini
6446441 seandainya semua berjalan lancar saya berharap dapat melaksanakan konsert ini sebelum penghujung tahun ini
6446442 mungkin juga kami akan membuat dua konsep iaitu sebuah konsert biasa dan juga persembahan makan malam semuanya bergantung kepada keadaan juga
6446443 memang saya ada hajat untuk beraksi di pentas itu tetapi buat masa ini belum ada sebarang perancangan lagi tengoklah nanti macam mana
6446444 dalam tempoh dua tahun ini saya banyak belajar untuk mengenali erti bertolak ansur dan bagaimana untuk menjaga hati suami
6446445 setakat ini semuanya berjalan dengan baik dan saya mengharapkan perkahwinan ini akan berkekalan sehingga ke akhir hayat kami berdua
6446446 biasalah kalau dah nama pun suami isteri kalau tak bergaduh tak sahlah kan tetapi daripada situ saya belajar bagaimana hendak memujuk hati suami kalau dia tengah marah
6446447 janganlah pula ditambah lagi kemarahannya apa yang penting doakanlah kebahagiaan kami sampai bila bila

6446747 we have integrated some of the key players from last seasons under 17 squad into this older group and that was bound to take some game time to balance
6446748 overall i was pleased enough with how we played it is always disappointing to lose matches both for the players and the staff but were not going to be too downbeat about it
6446749 spain have won their two matches this week and will present our toughest test they are reigning uefa champions at under 17 under 19 and senior levels so thats a great motivation for our lads

6446765 critically we remain focused on the health and care of the cow in working with farmers to increase global milk supply
6446766 we believe repositioning the operations with a strategic owner will allow monsanto to focus on the growth of its core seeds and traits business while ensuring that loyal dairy farmers continue to receive the value of posilac

6446776 for a long time the board of directors has been aware that the two very different business models of ingredients and sugar respectively were not an optimal combination
6446777 with these words the board of directors asks the annual general meeting for a mandate to close the sale of danisco sugar to german based nordzucker
6446778 if the annual general meeting rejects the proposal the board of directors will consider it a mandate to work towards an independent stock exchange listing or other alternatives
6446779 we are working hard to become a market driven organisation through and through by for example optimising and motivating our sales force so that danisco is at the top of relevant customers minds we want to be the company with the strongest innovation team the innovative company which others want to cooperate with and finally we want to be leading in sustainable production and products

6446808 the democrats in charge of this congress have been heavy on fluff and light on substance
6446809 the more carbs and sugars you eat the more your appetite control cells are damaged and potentially you consume more
6446810 people in the age group of 25 to 50 are most at risk the neurons that tell people in the crucial age range not to over eat are being killed off
6446811 when the stomach is empty it triggers the ghrelin hormone that notifies the brain that we are hungry when we are full a set of neurons known as pomcs kick in
6446812 however free radicals created naturally in the body attack the pomc neurons this process causes the neurons to degenerate overtime affecting our judgement as to when our hunger is satisfied
6446813 a diet rich in carbohydrate and sugar that has become more and more prevalent in modern societies over the last 20 30 years has placed so much strain on our bodies that its leading to premature cell deterioration

6446815 reactive oxygen species lead to oxidative stress in the body which can also cause dna damage we were able to gather clear evidence of a short term increase in certain indicators for oxidative stress during the competition and have already published these results however now we were also able to demonstrate that despite this increase no notable and persistent damage was caused to the athletes dna this is a surprising result which initially appears to contradict the data gathered in similar studies
6446816 the comparable studies analysed different biomarkers for predominantly short lived dna damage our study focused primarily on damage to dna that was subsequently evident in daughter cells following cell division and could therefore be of long term detriment to the body however we can sound the all clear in this respect our study clearly shows that in this case extreme competitive sport did not result in any increase in dna damage

6446821 it is possible that salesforce coms business is simply becoming more seasonal as it increasingly addresses large enterprise wide deployments and will hinge more upon large sequential increases in fourth quarter billings
6446822 we are concerned that smbs which make up 2 3 of salesforces customer base may suffer more markedly than their larger counterparts amid any ongoing economic weakness and that this may in turn impact salesforces bookings new and renewal and ultimately salesforces top line
6446823 indeed salesforce appears to have had some softness in its deferred revenues and bookings in the quarter perhaps giving fuel to this concern

6446852 mobileme is suppose to be microsoft exchange for the rest of us but microsoft exchange does things in a secure manner
6446853 as it is if you run a business using your mac then you cannot use mobileme because it transmits data insecurely
6446854 i wouldnt say that its a critical issue or something thats a reason not to use the service but its definitely something that should be addressed
6446855 the new lighting fixtures actually make the store brighter even though they use less energy
6446856 this project has a return on investment of nearly 100 in one year which certainly meets our criteria
6446857 aside from the great financial return lime energy performed all of the work in a turn key fashion so our staff did not really have to do anything they even obtained the full 26 000 rebate from the new jersey smartstart program on our behalf in the past we worked on some projects in house with our contract electricians but found this process with lime energy to be a lot smoother
6446858 there is a substantial amount of money to be saved from reduced energy use these days because of the high rates
6446859 next we are going to ask lime energy to look at the refrigeration system for our freezers and solar energy for our rooftops and we hope to find more cost effective projects there
6446860 the next 12 contracts were granted to lime energy because of our outstanding performance on the first project all the way through from the sale to the installation
6446861 whats interesting is that our audit process turned up some opportunities that were overlooked previously which adds another reason why the decision makers at jetro are confident in turning to lime energy for advice we are glad to find more ways to improve their bottom line and look forward to furthering our relationship

6446867 fixed an issue that could allow cross site scripting as reported by chris weber of casaba security details will be disclosed at a later date
6446868 opera thinks it is acceptable under specific circumstances to release a security update without publishing an advisory for the specific bug
6446869 if we publish without an advisory it is often because other vendors have not issued patches
6446870 publishing a full advisory only because weve patched something could leave users of other products unprotected while giving malicious hackers the information needed to cause damage
6446871 with these new enhancements consumers and health care providers will be able to look at individual hospital mortality scores we hope that this new information will cement the web sites role as a key driver in improving the quality and reliability of care in the nations hospitals

6446906 our team in charlotte is proud to provide technology that protects the men and women who protect us
6446907 we the undersigned urge you to declare a moratorium on immigration raids in the state of rhode island until our nation can implement a comprehensive and just reform of our immigration laws it is our hope that such reform will make immigration raids obsolete until then we believe that raids on the immigrant community are unjust unnecessary and counter productive
6446908 as religious leaders we understand and support the need to apprehend and arrest individuals who are responsible for felonies and other serious crimes the enforcement of just laws is necessary for public safety and the common good but the arrest of serious criminals is not what we have observed in the arrest and detention of immigrants that has taken place recently in our state particularly in newport and in providence
6446909 what we have witnessed is that the police action of ice against immigrants has divided the community instilled fear in our streets disrupted the everyday life of good people and separated family members innocent of any crime from one another the confusing and secretive detention of those arrested has further complicated the situation as religious leaders concerned for our people we ould be negligent of our pastoral duties if we didnt speak out against these unjust government policies and practices
6446910 we encourage the agents and staff of ice to evaluate the morality of their participation in immigration raids in the context of their faith and sanctity of their conscience if their discernment leads them to the conclusion that they cannot participate in such raids in good conscience we urge them not to do so if ice agents refuse to participate in immigration raids in conformity with their faith and conscience we urge the federal government to fully respect the wellfounded principles of conscientious objection
6446911 we continuously hear from the government that theyre going to do it that theyre going to put it here
6446912 even a year ago minister barry barnet said they were looking for a facility to house it
6446913 theyve been talking about this since i was elected in 2003
6446914 the need and demand is there the government just needs to do it but i dont think theres a big will on their part
6446915 i want to have a baby and start a family

6446924 we have no problem with looking at ways to expand the calendar improve the calendar so that we can get those instructional days but change really works when the true experts of education those are the people in the classroom initiate that change

6446926 for example over 78 percent of the subjects were concomitantly taking beta blockers and over 88 percent were taking statins amongst other medical interventions and treatments
6446927 we have no way of knowing from reading the study whether these interventions were continued through the lifecycle of the study which could significantly influence the outcomes
6446928 researchers realize there is debate over homocysteine hcy level as a marker for existing cardiovascular disease cvd or a predictor of cvd randomized clinical trials are currently testing whether lowering hcy levels through supplementation with b vitamins will reduce cvd
6446929 we know for certain is that there are significant populations of older people with cvd who have moderately low concentrations of serum
6446930 applying some degree of common sense there is a plausible link that needs to be investigated further it is important however that these findings not become generalized applied and reported to be related to a healthy population that may be responsibly supplementing with b vitamins and the preventative benefits they may derive
6446931 a study such as this is in no way conclusive and should not be represented as such or be used in any way to stop those who may currently benefit from taking b vitamins from continuing their regimens the overwhelming body of research shows that poor nutrition is much more of a health risk than using optimal levels of b vitamin supplementation in a balanced diet exercise and health regimen
6446932 this study like other similarly designed studies fails to answer the question of whether b vitamin supplementation over the long term can help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in a population that is healthy at baseline
6446933 its important to remember that there is a large body of observational data that suggests that higher b vitamin intake and lower homocysteine levels are both associated with lower cvd risk which is consistent with how vitamins are intended to be used as a preventive measure rather than as a treatment to already existing disease

6446963 by early 2010 we hope to be supporting 40 of these courses in eight schools across the five olympic boroughs involving 1 000 young learners aged 14 19 years old
6446964 everybody in britain has been rightly celebrating the achievements of team gb in beijing and it is important we build on this
6446965 its a time of big celebrations for all of us
6446966 im so happy that despite the war lack of sports facilities and training nikpai managed to secure a medal
6446967 i was so happy when i heard the news i was overjoyed i started crying and said thank god my son won
6446968 i wish him to come back home as a winner i was crying from happiness
6446969 it is indeed a big honour and a matter of great happiness for all of afghanistan for this is the first time an afghan athlete has managed to win a medal
6446970 i appeal to the government of afghanistan to support all the athletes of afghanistan not only rohullah this is the time of sport not the time of war
6446971 its the first round of a general election so the state of washington in a literal sense and historic sense no longer has a primary the parties really cant choose their own nominees anymore
6446972 they best represent the district because theyre the top vote getters
6446973 theres a certain logic that says they ought to be the ones squaring off in november theyll have to campaign through november and be accountable to voters thats healthy for our process
6446974 im not sure where its going to go we dont have any immediate plans to claim harm from what happened yesterday in a legal sense well see how this all pans out
6446975 im still optimistic well win that lawsuit and the top two will be found to be unconstitutional
6446976 i have no problem with him doing a show i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6446977 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6446978 the new fully cgmp compliant combined operation is fda registered and licensed for dea schedule 2 3 and 4 the key attributes of both the manufacturing facility and the laboratory are rapid turnaround and competitive pricing
6446979 we anticipate that the addition of small batch contract manufacturing to our roster of services strategically positions the company as a full service pharmaceutical and nutritional enterprise
6446980 the pieces of the puzzle that worked for us in the past were already in place it wasnt like we had to get new guys in the loop we made a conscious decision given the challenges presented to stick with what was working
6446981 from a coachs perspective that can be a dangerous way to go into things maintaining the status quo but the other coaches and myself didnt think we had much of an alternative we werent going to be able to practice normally evaluate and install guys so we kept plugging along and it worked for us
6446982 even in the areas like long island and new jersey where it geographically made some sense for our guys to practice those were both mid week thursday night games and guys work during the week fate did not smile on us thats where having a lot of veterans and guys that have been around truly helped us
6446983 ive said it from the beginning of the year were the two time defending champs and we havent lost anybody its our belt until somebody takes it away
6446984 it wasnt until the end of the season that it dawned on me that the traveling never became an issue it was something that we were all prepared for mentally i never heard a single guy use it as an excuse when things might have not been doing well we certainly had our share of bumps in the road missed flights and missing bags but the guys never used that as a reason for not performing im really proud of them and our staff
6446985 ive said it from the beginning of the year were the two time defending champs and we havent lost anybody its our belt until somebody takes it away
6446986 i would like to be back in philly under different ownership but i dont know if thats going to happen not saying it wont happen though
6446987 well play the season out and probably after october youll start to hear rumblings about a move or being diminished or relocated i take it day by day thats how i live my life

6446994 the media have been used to promote cigarettes and smoking through infamous advertising icons such as the marlboro man and joe camel and through tobacco images in hollywood movies the media have also been used to increase smoking cessation and reduce smoking initiation through paid advertising campaigns and public service announcements about the dangers of smoking this monograph presents the most current and comprehensive analysis of the scientific evidence on the impact of these forces and other media exposures on beliefs attitudes and behaviors concerning tobacco use
6446995 the tobacco industry tried for five years to shut down our successful truth r youth smoking prevention campaign
6446996 ninety percent of adult smokers began before the age of 20 so cultivating new smokers is critical to big tobaccos business model to replace the more than 400 000 adults who die from tobacco annually with new smokers keeping young people from starting to smoke is a critical part of the equation if we want to make major strides toward saving lives bold effective counter marketing campaigns that reduce smoking rates and change social norms are proven effective in doing just that
6446997 this report sends a loud and clear message to policy makers we need less tobacco company marketing and more anti tobacco advertising
6446998 it shows why we need strong regulation of tobacco products and their marketing to prevent tobacco companies from continuing to target our children it also should prompt states to fully fund tobacco prevention and cessation campaigns that are proven to work and it should spur governments worldwide to implement the international tobacco control treaty which calls on governments to ban all tobacco advertising promotion and sponsorship and fund effective public education campaigns
6446999 im very glad that the federal government has thrown its weight behind this important issue
6447000 filmmakers are usually very concerned with issues of social responsibility thats what many of our best films are about but they need more education especially about the very young age at which most people start to smoke and more proof that the smoking in our movies and tv shows if presented irresponsibly can actually be the same as handing a 12 year old a cigarette todays announcement should go a long way towards providing that proof
6447001 this new report provides compelling evidence that the tobacco industry continues to market to our children
6447002 it is essential that we protect the health of our nations youth by halting promotion aimed at encouraging our kids to take up smoking
6447003 the relocation of danas corporate headquarters facility enables us to consolidate our local operations and make the most efficient use of our toledo area footprint

6447012 our teams experience in large scale residential and hospitality architecture further bolsters the prospects for this partnership
6447013 latin america is becoming one of the top places for retirement due to the natural amenities and the lower cost of living increasing numbers of u s and european baby boomers are looking at retiring overseas to take advantage of the lower cost of living
6447014 improvements to healthcare systems and pension programs such as panamas pensionado are attractive to foreign retirees
6447015 many urban areas in latin america urgently need retirement alternatives that are tailored to specific needs and levels of care required this is especially true as fewer families provide care at home for their senior relatives with csd we will help our clients develop appropriate housing options for the specific stages of life from active retired and independent lifestyles to assisted living and long term care

6447019 the integration of aircraft into the organic structure of the ground forces is as radical a change as the move from the horse to the truck and the process is only beginning
6447020 it is therefore not too much to say that the future itself in whose molding we expect to have our share is in the hands of the soldiers of the 101st airborne division
6447021 its the greatest privilege that i can possibly imagine to have served in this division and to be blessed with such a team that we have here
6447022 we use the air assault as a means to deny the enemy sanctuary and security
6447023 we have choked the enemy out of his supply lines and his comfort zone
6447024 the enemy is seeing that we are capable of covering a vast amount of terrain unimpeded by zig zagged roads obstacles and improvised explosive devices
6447025 having trained combat experienced soldiers to conduct air operations helps us tremendously
6447026 utilizing the mobility of the air assault allows us to support locations in the salah ad din province that otherwise may not be accessible due to road conditions and terrain limitations
6447027 every time iraqi soldiers go out with us they learn something
6447028 they appreciate what helicopters and the air assault can bring to the fight here and are always eager to learn more
6447029 of course its not that easy as your opponents have several ways to interfere with your plans such as playing hill tiles that slow trains along your budding network
6447030 si la libertad significa algo ser sobre todo el derecho a decirle a la gente aquello que no quiere o r
6447031 no estoy de acuerdo con una sola palabra de lo que dices pero dar a la vida por defender tu derecho a decirlo
6447032 la libertad sancho es uno de los m s preciosos dones que a los hombres dieron los cielos con ella no pueden igualarse los tesoros que encierra la tierra ni el mar encubre por la libertad as como por la honra se puede y debe aventurar la vida y por el contrario el cautiverio es el mayor mal que puede venir a los hombres
6447033 las fuerzas de seguridad tanto la polic a como las fuerzas armadas van a estar muy alertas porque lo que no se puede permitir es que se genere violencia a partir de un llamado y una convocatoria tan agresiva como la del se or costas prefecto de santa cruz

6447045 we are hoping to get as wide an approval as possible so that we can move on with regard to having this agreement for congress to look at but i dont want to get ahead of the suppliers group meeting
6447046 we think this agreement is very good for the united states and india and for the international community otherwise we would not be pursuing this
6447047 the immediate termination of all nuclear commerce by nsg member states if new delhi detonates a nuclear explosive device
6447048 would be inconsistent with us law place american firms at a severe competitive disadvantage and undermine critical us nonproliferation objectives
6447049 a rivalry made all the more precarious by the resignation on tuesday of the pakistani president pervez musharraf
6447050 this deal was foolish when pakistan was relatively stable with mr musharraf gone an arms race on the subcontinent would likely be more difficult to control
6447051 hes terrific hes a different guy i shouldnt say it that way he has always been a good guy
6447052 sometimes when youre young you drive a motorcycle without a helmet its not what anybody wants but it happens he has matured that way as far as not taking crazy risks anymore and hes also matured in how to handle people
6447053 thats a big thing that young kids need to learn when they come in here as high draft choices the way pittsburgh loves the steelers its like the old saying that sometimes there can be too much love it can get overbearing and you have to learn how to handle it as a young guy some never get used to it but hes doing really well
6447054 i think its offensive coordinator bruce arians offense the offense that he put in
6447055 its an understanding of whats going on another year of maturing and understanding offenses and defenses where my guys are going to be
6447056 that says a lot that bruce was willing to trust me with a lot of the play calling especially in his first year as coordinator his first year running the offense with the stuff we have
6447057 putting that faith and trust in me to run the things he calls change the things he calls run the no huddle its nice that he has the faith in me
6447058 the book on him going into last year was that if you could get the steelers into a throwing game and keep him throwing short eventually he was going to make a few mistakes
6447059 i wouldnt say hes or tom brady yet but he really progressed last season he was much more precise much more careful with the ball hes not just firing deep passes anymore this is a guy who can run a 10 play drive where he has to throw a lot
6447060 working hard at practice being consistent being a good player thats how you become a leader
6447061 i think ben has done it that way now hes starting to be more vocal about it but he has to be hes a quarterback before we had a lot of leaders older guys like jerome bettis and who would do the talking now with them gone its on ben
6447062 gee something bad was said about this person so im not going to vote for him
6447063 establishing business credit that is entirely separate from personal credit is crucial
6447064 first off it protects your personal credit score from being affected by business debt which can negatively impact your ability to qualify for a mortgage or car loan and it safeguards your business from personal financial strains if youre already struggling to make your mortgage payment the last thing you want is to lose your business possibly your only source of income
6447065 if your business credit is tied to your personal credit the more they check the more your score drops and once again your personal finances can take a hit every time you apply for a personal loan
6447066 many lenders only report missed payments and defaults but good credit goes beyond just keeping it blemish free
6447067 you should be rewarded for good behavior too not just penalized for the bad

6447085 the recently proposed enliven transaction is not like prior strategic acquisitions costa brava will be voting our 973 000 shares against the enliven acquisition
6447086 we have limited capital resources as well as recurring operating losses and negative cash flows that are expected to continue for the foreseeable future the conditions combined with the possibility of the accelerated payment of a 3 4 million subordinated note in the event our common stock is delisted raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern
6447087 based on enlivens first six months performance as of august 2008 dg fastchannel now expects full year 2008 revenue of enliven of approximately 25 5 million a reduction of approximately 14 from the full year 2008 estimates provided by enliven management prior to the execution of the merger agreement
6447088 we dont want the company to pay 100 million for a strategic distraction the deal certainly doesnt pencil out and its too much money to purchase what looks to be more of a problem rather than an opportunity

6447100 leading alliance members came to us and whispered in our ears hoping that we do not halt cooperation with nato on afghanistan
6447101 everything depends on nato if their priorities go to the unconditional support of the bankrupt regime of georgian president mikhail saakashvili regime to the detriment of partnership with nato its not our fault
6447102 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6447103 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues

6447315 when i made the woman she had to be special i made her shoulders strong enough to carry the weight of the world yet gentle enough to give comfort i gave her an inner strength to endure childbirth and the rejection that many times comes from her children i gave her a hardness that allows her to keep going when everyone else gives up and take care of her family through sickness and fatigue without complaining i gave her the sensitivity to love her children under any and all circumstances even when her child has hurt her very badly i gave her strength to carry her husband through his faults and fashioned her from his rib to protect his heart i gave her wisdom to know that a good husband never hurts his wife but sometimes tests her strengths and her resolve to stand beside him unfalteringly and finally i gave her a tear to shed this is hers exclusively to use whenever it is needed

6447373 is the genius of american prison expansion having failed to make prisons effective we have learned to make them profitable
6447374 at the eastern oregon correctional institution inmates dont make license plates any more
6447375 they make money 6 25 an hour on average manufacturing casual clothing the prison here like prisons across america is turning itself into a for profit factory cashing in on a tight labor market
6447376 so this is going to breathe new life into our town
6447377 theyll have inmates working there for 25 or 50 cents an hour how is a local cabinet shop or tool maker supposed to compete with that kind of slave labor
6447378 but saying that is not good for business this industry depends on feeding itself it has to say theres a crisis
6447379 by 1995 under the mandatory minimum sentencing laws the average federal prison term served for selling crack cocaine was nearly 11 years
6447380 for homicide by comparison the national average was barely six
6447381 marketers of prison labor thats the best way to grow our prison population
6447382 but you now have enough businessmen and corrupt politicians with a financial interest in heightening the public perception of crime and expanding the prison industry

6447415 well people are just not volunteering in sufficient numbers the allies are pulling not adding troops so he is down to a draft or winding down the war he will not tell you this but here is the answer he will have to call for a military draft period the military would prefer not to do it draftees are more difficult to train and form into cohesive fighting forces but there is no other way to fight all his wars at the level he wishes to fight them no mccain is not joking about his war policies he just will not tell the truth about the implications he will of course deny vigorously when challenged that they require a military draft

6447449 i love my house im really happy here and theres less work for me to do as its all on one level there are people in this housing scheme who are around my age who live on their own too we are becoming quite a community
6447450 this is because we are unconstrained by council borders and can successfully rehouse residents in more suitable homes in the region including newham barking and dagenham and along the thames corridor into essex and kent
6447451 we are proud of the instrumental role that we played enabling mrs griggs to move out of her old house and into her new home linne griffin pictured above helped mrs griggs when she moved and this made a tremendous difference to her
6447452 mrs griggs former home was a much needed social house that has now been fully occupied by a young family
6447453 we support the boroughs housing teams by providing much needed high quality housing across the region thus offering a holistic approach to social housing
6447454 southern housing group is part of the east london housing partnership which is considering adopting the perfect fit scheme that scheme started in south east london and is being taken up by housing associations in other parts of london as well
6447455 it helps under occupying tenants to move to smaller more manageable homes releasing their larger homes for families just as staff in our thames gateway office did for mrs griggs
6447456 there is a desperate housing shortage and we are supporting the governments targets by successfully placing residents in suitable housing southern housing group is close to announcing a strategy that will tackle these issues across all the areas where we have homes
6447457 everybody knows that protein is one of the building blocks of life and you will find no finer protein in the blogosphere than that produced at protein wisdom
6447458 the fact that john mccain cant keep track of how many houses he owns is a telling moment that helps explain why he thinks the fundamentals of our economy are strong and why hes just offering more of the same economic policies that weve gotten from president bush for the last eight years
6447459 i understand that senator mccain was asked yesterday this question how many houses do you own and he couldnt answer that question he couldnt count high enough apparently to even know how many houses he owns

6447462 the impact of climate change on human and global security could extend far beyond the limited scope the world has seen thus far
6447463 most critical for human survival are water and food which are sensitive to changing climatic conditions
6447464 environmental changes caused by global warming will not only affect human living conditions but may also generate larger societal effects by threatening the infrastructures of society or by inducing social responses that aggravate the problem
6447465 the associated socio economic and political stress can undermine the functioning of communities the effectiveness of institutions and the stability of societal structures these degraded conditions could contribute to civil strife and worse armed conflict
6447466 large areas of africa are suffering from scarcity of food and fresh water resources making them more vulnerable to conflict an example is sudans darfur province where an ongoing conflict was aggravated since droughts forced arab herders to move into areas of african farmers
6447467 although climate change bears a significant conflict potential it can also transform the international system toward more cooperation if it is seen as a common threat that requires joint action
6447468 the bali roadmap has many good ideas but was criticized as being too vague to induce a major policy shift
6447469 nevertheless the seeming conflict between environment and the economy will be best overcome with the recognition that protecting the climate in the best interest of the economy
6447470 history has shown how dependent our culture is on a narrow window of climatic conditions for average temperature and precipitation
6447471 the great human civilizations began to flourish after the last ice age and some disappeared due to droughts and other adverse shifts in the climate
6447472 the consequences were quite severe in parts of europe associated with loss of harvest and population decline
6447473 riots and military conflicts became more likely as a recent empirical study has suggested
6447474 the challenge is to slow down the dynamics and stabilize the climate system at levels which are not dangerous
6447475 global warming receives now more public and political attention than a few years ago
6447476 grass roots movements are emerging in the united states for protecting the climate and developing energy alternatives involving not only many local communities and companies but also influential states such as california led by gov arnold schwarzenegger
6447477 congressional and presidential candidates now acknowledge that something has to be done to play a leading role on energy and climate change to not fall behind the rest of the world

6447549 growing up and watching races on tv that was for sure one of the races i made a point to watch especially the night race
6447550 i think back at some of the great finishes there with dale earnhardt and terry labonte rusty wallace jeff gordon some of the bump and runs for victories things like that its just a great race track
6447551 and then for me the very first time i went there in the truck series i won that night in 2003 i had a great truck there last year its just a place that i really enjoy going i scored my first cup top 10 there its just a place for me that im comfortable at
6447552 i like what they did when they reconfigured it youre able to pass without having to bump the guy out of the way which for the competitors is better maybe the race fans have a different view
6447553 but its just a fun track its the ultimate short track
6447554 ive been in the middle of turns 1 and 2 and drove into the wreck in turn 3
6447555 it happens so fast obviously the laps times are real quick its just one of those places that its got so much banking that as a driver when youre in a corner you cant see the straightaway really until you kind of pop up out of the hole and its just tough add comment

6447594 this will be the fourth race for this car here everyone has it figured out by now it does a great job on the short tracks like bristol where you tend to use the bump and run to pass the way the bumpers on these cars line up you can still nudge someone to make the pass but they dont spin out as often

6447625 polygamy encourages child abuse people say citing instances involving the marriage of older men to underage girls assuming for the sake of argument that this is true it still doesnt justify categorical prohibitions on polygamy alcohol consumption may encourage sexual violence its often blamed for date rape should we prohibit its use as members of the womens christian temperance union demanded over one hundred years ago or should we prosecute alcohol fueled violence whenever we find it we rightly prohibit violence not drunkenness even though some drunks are violent we should prohibit child abuse not polygamy even though some polygamists are abusers
6447626 nontheists who favor civil unions for everyone taking the state out of the business of approving or disapproving religious matrimonial rites should be especially supportive of the first amendment right to engage in polygamous marriages sanctified by any faith whether or not polygamy should be legalized so that people in polygamous marriages enjoy equal rights and entitlements like social security benefits it should at least be decriminalized why should we care about other peoples private religious ceremonies how dare we criminalize them

6447630 our findings suggest that people can make accurate inferences about others personality traits and behavioural dispositions based on certain signals conveyed by the face
6447631 the facial structure of a man provides an indication of how aggressive he will be in a competitive situation
6447632 therefore we are able to predict with some accuracy the behaviour of men on the basis of their facial features
6447633 if mens faces are providing cues as to their potential for aggression then likely people are probably picking up on this cue although likely on a subconscious level

6447657 so we think that this kind of biomarker could be used in a rapid and non invasive way to detect skin cancer
6447658 and this would be novel because now the only way to do so is with a visual exam and a biopsy which is of course invasive
6447659 because when youre dealing with cancer the margin for error is really small you dont want to miss something that may be a cancer that then doesnt get treated and you dont want to treat someone for cancer if they actually have something else so its really a very novel and interesting idea but one which i think really needs to be further researched and carefully confirmed

6447714 having everybody in the same control room we get a much closer level of communication between the teams running the various facilities which is one of the best ways of ensuring the quality of the beam for the lhc
6447715 the curves on this screen show the magnets pulsing and the intensity of the beam the backdrop of numbers relates to the protons hitting the targets in the north experimental area we read these patterns and from the shape of the curves for example we can instantly see what is happening in the sps machine
6447716 these correctors can be used to re centre the beam at any point using pickups to measure the beam position
6447717 im working on the interface to the lhc beam interlock system if there is a problem with equipment or with the beam the beam has to be dumped within a few hundred microseconds and this means that a decision has to be made by the hardware we have designed monitoring and control software so that we can deduce from the hardware exactly what happened inside the machine when a beam was dumped and then control and correct that problem in the end its a very big complex machine involving a lot of people and everything has to work in sync
6447718 i can do nothing for those who do not ask themselves questions

6447722 it is probably the first time in the history of particle physics that a major new accelerator project has been documented in such a comprehensive coherent and up to date manner before it goes into operation it is a much needed update of the technical design reports some of which are now more than 10 years old
6447723 this project has been marked all along the way by an excellent spirit of collaboration between the lhc machine and experiments that bodes well for future common initiatives we have also appreciated the excellent collaboration with jinst
6447724 we were all impressed by the quality of the scientific peer review provided by jinst
6447725 given the size and complexity of these papers and the short deadlines that we had to impose to see these papers published before lhc start up this has been a major achievement

6447762 its no secret that sunderland admire david and have talked about a transfer hes up there for a medical today
6447763 if david has been spotted at sunderland he didnt wear that disguise i told him to
6447764 well see what happens now but its certainly a possibility the transfer could go through
6447765 we left the house we left everything and came on foot because to stay there was impossible
6447766 they are burning the houses from most of the houses they are taking everything they are stealing everything even such things as toothbrushes and toilets they are taking the toilets imagine they are taking broken refrigerators
6447767 we are so heartbroken i dont know what to say or even think our whole lives we were working to save something and one day we lost everything now i have to start everything from the very beginning
6447768 there was a bomb in the garden and all the apples on the trees fell down
6447769 the wall fell down all the windows were destroyed and now there is nothing left because of the fire
6447770 they came and asked us for wine but first we had to drink it ourselves to show that it was not poisoned then they drank the wine themselves and then they said to leave this place as soon as possible otherwise they would kill us the russians were looking for anyone who had soldiers in their home if anyone had a georgian soldier at home they burned the houses immediately
6447771 he was trying to keep the house and the fields
6447772 afterward he wanted to leave but he was circled by soldiers it was impossible he was in the orchards hiding from the russians in case they lit the house he was walking and met the russian soldiers and he made up his mind that he couldnt stay any more the russian soldiers called him and asked where he was going if he was going to the american side
6447773 my husband said he was going to see his family
6447774 and the russians said again are you going to the american side
6447775 so the russians view you as the american side even though there are no americans here
6447776 they support us so much we thought we were alone i am so thankful for the support we have from the united states and from the west the support is very important for us
6447777 the west saved the capital they were moving to tbilisi there was one night that was very dangerous the russian tanks were very close to the capital i dont know what happened but they moved the tanks back
6447778 bush and mccain made their strongest speeches yet the russians seemed to back down bush and mccain have been very good for us
6447779 why do you think the russians are doing this in your village
6447780 some of them are ossetians too not only russians and not only soldiers some are there just to steal things from ossetia and chechnya
6447781 russia can have at its borders only enemies or vassals

6447811 152 is not a very high number when you look at other clubs coaches are near 250 and up towards 300
6447812 historically the swans whether it be sydney or south melbourne have chopped and changed a fair bit and havent had much stability
6447813 hopefully i brought that and certainly paul has as well
6447814 i think it proves that if a club is pretty stable and you give a coach a chance to develop some players it can work for you
6447815 over a period of time under rocket eade and under myself the club has been pretty successful
6447816 last week i levelled the record and this week i suspect i will break it because ive got the total support of the board at the moment unless something happens between now and saturday

6447820 managers of a downtown office building yanked a sculpture called
6447821 shortly after the installation went up on aug 3 a group of tenants complained to the buildings manager cynthia muller muller wouldnt say which tenants objected to the art but the artist and curator say they were lawyers from two of the buildings resident law firms
6447822 of all the office buildings downtown washington square is perhaps the oddest place for an underwear art controversy one of its tenants is victorias secret
6447823 one of them was employed during may last year and he witnessed mr burden shooting a number of buzzards and attempting to shoot a number of buzzards
6447824 at the end of this particular witnesss term of employment he was so disturbed by what he saw that he reported the matter
6447825 independently of that witness another witness came forward and that witness too saw similar things
6447826 he was losing big numbers the shoot was ready to start in september and he had to keep the numbers up
6447827 so funny how people often are in denial of how they like the intimacy of a much smaller burn and a lot of these people work for the organisation who let it slowly morph into a giant rave but still they organize a pre burn for themselves of course it came organically but still it feels like the week before is the best time on the playa really more intimate and just with the people building and creating something no giant rave camp disturbing the desert or the night at that time you can feel like youre with a nice group of people and in a special place that the black rock desert is
6447828 maybe we could have the rave camps a bit further out
6447829 and i should add that you could get the participants to build the man and bring the used lumber just let them do it its their burn isnt it
6447830 burning man people have a hard time letting things go
6447831 i wonder why i wasnt being obscene i wasnt being rude
6447832 die von der telekom angeboten ausweicharbeitspl tze in bonn sind nat rlich f r die arbeitsnehmer aus trier und umgebung keine zumutbare alternative
6447833 we have an incredibly successful era under stuart and there is a little bit of a similarity there
6447834 i think we are hopefully making the right steps to get back to where we were when he was coaching
6447835 i think freddie has taken stuarts coaching on board and freddie has got his own style as well
6447836 it is a bit of a contrast in styles there but certainly both of them have got the same principles and the same work ethic as well so theres a lot of similarities there
6447837 every time you play a team coached by ricky stuart you know you are in for a tough game and certainly thats the way they play their football
6447838 i dont think theyve had a game where they havent turned up to play this year and thats the way the teams he coaches prepare and thats the way youve got to prepare if you want to be able to hold them
6447839 all of us want to cement a top four spot with a three point buffer ahead of brisbane
6447840 its important in that respect but we certainly feel it is two different competitions
6447841 apart from the 74 500 spectators and the tv audience you mean
6447842 did you watch munster v toulouse in the hc final
6447843 we are utterly resolute in our determination to support this new democracy of afghanistan
6447844 we will not relax from our efforts to support reconstruction of afghanistan because we understand that with afghanistan the frontline against the taliban what happens in afghanistan affects the rest of the world
6447845 while it is true that there is a summer offensive by the taliban it is also true that the tactics the taliban had to adopt are more of a guerrilla nature than they are a head on confrontation with our forces and we have been successful in winning back territory
6447846 i accept that pakistan and the problems of terrorism there is something thats got to be raised with the pakistan government and will continue to do so
6447847 you make our country proud every day of the week and every week of the year you are truly heroes of our country
6447848 you know that you are on the frontline of the fight against the taliban and you know that what you are doing here prevents terrorism coming to the streets of britain
6447849 all around the gate i saw blood and human flesh
6447850 there were bodies lying everywhere and wounded people soaked in blood were screaming for help
6447851 many of the wounded were either without legs or hands i could see body parts hanging on trees
6447852 we are confident that our business having been restructured is in a strong position to move forward whenever the market improves
6447853 whilst at the beginning of april we experienced a significant market downturn sales volumes since then have not deteriorated any further
6447854 their journey has been amazing some of these guys have got to travel four hours through three check points just to get to one hours training
6447855 we know that sports can overcome the barriers of religion gender and also of conflicted areas such as ours
6447856 we are familiar with the afl only for the last year or so we learn this totally new game and we met totally new stars and celebrities such as dipper

6447859 theyve gone out and announced theyre going to set the benchmark so theyre the ones putting pressure on themselves
6447860 theyre probably capable of backing it up because theyve recruited possibly the best out of the whole league with the quality and experience theyve bought
6447861 but i just hope they put their best team out against us so we can look to exploit any of the weaknesses theyve got left in them if there are any
6447862 if i cop a bit of niggle theyre probably going to get a bit back but theres no hard feelings its just all part of the game and im looking forward to playing against a very good friend of mine like iain fyfe and the other guys that are still there from when i was there
6447863 if only you could it would mean a lot to me if i can score against them again youll see in my celebration just how much

6447868 hell get to the ton this week and good on him
6447869 hopefully people do run out because i watched essendons matthew lloyd in 2000 01 and st kildas fraser gehrig in 2004 and when i was younger tony lockett and those sort of blokes have the fans run out
6447870 my old mans pretty keen to get out there so i hopefully i can get there
6447871 you look in the paper the next day and he gets 10 shots a week anyway so hes bound to kick 2 8 or something like that
6447872 apart from the 74 500 spectators and the tv audience you mean
6447873 did you watch munster v toulouse in the hc final
6447874 we have an understanding that he bennett has a job to do and i have a job to do and personal feelings about each other dont come into it
6447875 once wayne signed with st george he always had to plan for st george
6447876 id hate to think though that his main focus wasnt on making sure that the side was playing well and in good form
6447877 this year is still our main focus and weve both still got a job to do
6447878 we wouldnt be doing the right thing by the players if that wasnt the case
6447879 wayne bennett obviously has things he has to plan with st george and were doing the same for the brisbane broncos
6447880 its a difficult situation but darius has made his decision we know about it now and we have to move on
6447881 if anyone wants to doubt israels signing here they just need to go and look at a few of his games and what he can do
6447882 hes young and hes a wonderful player and hes got a long long career ahead of him
6447883 we needed that area of our game fixed up and he can certainly fill the void for us
6447884 we have lost some good players but weve also signed some good players and we think weve got a couple of good young players in our under 20s who can come through next year which well find out in the next few months
6447885 apart from the 74 500 spectators and the tv audience you mean
6447886 did you watch munster v toulouse in the hc final
6447887 we all know what were capable of its just a matter of whether we want to play that way
6447888 weve made a few excuses for ourselves because weve been missing players but at the end of the day we didnt have the right attitude last week
6447889 weve got all our players back now so there cant be any excuses this week
6447890 we all knew after the game on friday night against the dragons that our attitude wasnt there
6447891 time will tell whether everyones changed their attitude but theres been a bit of soul searching this week
6447892 we need to win our remaining three games and win them with some sore of authority
6447893 the big arm guard he only has to notice that and his confidence is going to be a little bit rocked
6447894 any halfback who is a main ball player is going to get tested and were no different
6447895 our big wide running forwards head for those guys and our plays revolve around engaging those players hell get tested
6447896 every time i play theres always forwards out to get me
6447897 i think i overcame a lot of demons last week taking the field
6447898 im little more confident that i can get through the full 80 and i wouldnt be playing if i didnt think that
6447899 im sure the broncos will be targeting me a little in defence but thats to be expected
6447900 hes got a varied kicking game which weve talked about and weve got a plan to handle that
6447901 theres certain players that we need to be aware that are around the area hes going to kick to so i think weve got that covered

6447904 at the moment ive only read and heard of these things and up till now theres been nothing official

6447908 the government told us we had the right to protest
6447909 at out our age we have nothing left to lose were not afraid of doing anything
6447910 this whole thing is about the fact weve been deprived of our human rights even though im illiterate i still know we should be entitled to our basic rights
6447911 in the whole history of china ive near heard of a government doing such ugly things to old people
6447912 at first we were happy to hear the government was allowing protests during the games but now we realise that promise was fake im very very angry
6447913 even when we go and have breakfast theyre still watching us
6447914 just a little bit every day however much you can manage after school
6447915 and dont look so grumpy the days are shorter and shorter
6447916 looks like youre near the center though thats pretty cool
6447917 hard to tell at this angle are they heading for us
6447918 whered they even go i mean really are they just hiding back there until we leave
6447919 this isnt hard hadyn some big birds dive bombed us they dropped these cool tubes it makes no sense its awesome totally factor 10 cool
6447920 maybe theyre some sort of carrier pigeon but do carrier pigeons even fly anymore
6447921 only on gilligans island tv land listen to me youre just guessing
6447922 obviously they are what if they need to carry these things farther still what if theyre just resting what if they are trained to do this when they need to rest drop their packages find a hole rest then grab their stuff and carry on
6447923 so are you suggesting we flush them out cause there is no way im going to crawl back there they can get out later on their own
6447924 this band looks like ivory but its hard to tell in this light
6447925 smells old yuck turn on your flashlight mine is getting weak
6447926 you have been chosen for a life of great purpose adventure awaits you in the hidden lands
6447927 looks like something from king arthur what in the world are the hidden lands
6447928 you have been chosen for a life of great purpose adventure awaits you in the hidden lands
6447929 you take two and ill take two stick them under your shirt and act cool i have no idea what these are but for now theyre our little secret
6447930 and none of your games either ewan i mean it im not in the mood
6447931 well do our opposition meeting this morning and itll probably be a bit shorter because i think if you go into it too much it can become quite daunting
6447932 so lets concentrate on what were trying to achieve rather than looking at the whatever you want to call them behemoth
6447933 theyre a wonderful wonderful wonderful side it will be a tough ask but well go down there and give it our best shot
6447934 were in pretty good form we have been much more consistent in the back half of the year and we want to keep that going
6447935 but going down to a hostile environment like that weve had some good wins down there in the last few years but weve come off a couple of hidings against geelong so we need to make sure were at our best
6447936 i dont think we can afford to keep any of our powder dry its a wonderful learning curve particularly for our younger guys that we go down there play the way we want to play and do the very best we can
6447937 certainly our footy club is not in a position to play ducks and drakes or resting players whereas the cats are probably in a bit of a different position
6447938 theyve got three or four that have been out do they play them or do they give them an extra week to make sure theyre right

6447944 which is not only necessary but essential for his defence
6447945 has held that the uk government is under a duty to disclose evidence which it holds about the treatment of binyam mohamed between his detention by pakistani authorities in april 2002 and his subsequent reappearance in bagram air base in july 2004
6447946 we are considering the implications of this judgment very carefully
6447947 we have never contested that mr mohameds defence lawyers should have access to information which would assist him in his defence in any trial at guantanamo bay
6447948 the court recognised the strenuous efforts that we have made to assist mr mohamed in guantanamo bay including efforts to ensure that the information hmg holds which relates to a small part of mr mohameds account of what happened to him is made available to him for purposes of his defence in any prosecution in the us system
6447949 for strong reasons of national security to which the court accepted we were entitled to give the highest weight we could not agree to disclose this information voluntarily
6447950 these and other issues relating to national security will be considered at a further hearing next week
6447951 todays judgment reflects the abhorrence of decent society at the methods employed by the united states government in the supposed war on terror
6447952 it has taken the courts of this country to intervene and reiterate the importance of upholding the rule of law
6447953 we can only hope that the foreign secretary will now reflect on this judgment and provide direct assistance to binyams defence team
6447954 compelling the british government to release information that can prove mr mohameds innocence is one obvious step towards making up for the years of torture that he has suffered
6447955 the next step is for the british government to demand an end to the charade against him in guantanamo bay and return him home to britain
6447956 we commend the courts recognition that torture is abhorrent and can never be justified
6447957 that evidence plainly discloses a case to answer but bm contends that this evidence is inadmissible because it was obtained as a result of a two year period of incommunicado detention between april 2002 and may 2004 during which he was subjected to torture and cruel inhuman or degrading treatment at the hands of the pakistani and moroccan authorities with the connivance of the united states government and to similar treatment by the united states government itself
6447958 because he contends he is under no duty to do so and because of his concerns of resulting damage to national security
6447959 will make no order for the provision of the information
6447960 and the court has made its decision on those issues at a further hearing and if the court decides that information is to be provided has resolved any dispute as to the manner in which it is to be provided
6447961 was in fact any wrongdoing by or on behalf of the united states government
6447962 it is important to emphasise that we therefore do not do so
6447963 it is clear from the evidence we have seen that every effort has been made by the united kingdom government to try and secure bms return and to provide him with assistance save for disclosing to his lawyers the documents and information the subject of these proceedings
6447964 the refusal to disclose is based on concerns of damage to national security that such disclosure might well entail
6447965 has a very strong record in advocating the case against torture and urging other states not to use torture
6447966 this is a welcome ruling any information that the uk government holds about how binyam mohamed may have been treated must be made available to his legal team
6447967 if torture or ill treatment has taken place it should be exposed investigated and any confessions extracted under torture should be discounted
6447968 binyam has already been held in harsh conditions for over six years according to his lawyer his mental health has suffered considerably
6447969 david miliband should ask the us to move him to a less oppressive part of the guantanamo prison complex at the earliest opportunity
6447970 weve been saying it but i dont think anyones been taking us seriously i guess they are now
6447971 when you put jamaicans in an environment like this only good things will happen i think as a team were dominating the sport
6447972 the americans have dominated in the past but this olympics has been a jamaican olympics
6447973 jamaicas doing very well at the olympics im just happy for everybody
6447974 i think the world has recognised that that island has a lot of talent

6447978 for the senior guys and the young guys to experience the hype of still being in the hunt at this time of year is fantastic
6447979 theres a great vibrancy around the club all weve got to do is win these last two games and hope some results go our way
6447980 we played really well against them early on in the year but theyve improved in terms of contested ball possession and clearance work which is what were good at so that will be a good challenge
6447981 i still think theyre a quality side i dont think where they are on the ladder is really what theyre capable of
6447982 theyve got some good players and i think their second half of the year theyve been in games where theyve only lost by a couple of kicks or that sort of thing
6447983 i love big challenges were both two totally different players hes got the height and i try to use my speed and agility around the ground

6447986 essendon is decimated i suppose but i can guarantee that essendon will put out 22 players on the field and theyll be having a red hot go
6447987 we do need to win we would probably go into the game as favourites but were going to go into it with an underdog attitude
6447988 weve got the confidence in our players and we think with just a few minor tweaks and adjustments in their attitude we can get the results we had earlier in the year
6447989 tommy wont play this week hell play the following week barring any setbacks

6447997 i have stated time after time after time that roe v wade was a bad decision that i support a woman the rights of the unborn that i have fought for human rights and human dignity throughout my entire political career
6447998 to me its an issue of human rights and human dignity
6447999 he voted against family planning he voted against the freedom of access to clinic entrances that was about violence against women in clinics
6448000 he voted against funding for teen pregnancy prevention programs and making sure that abstinence only was medically accurate this is very very extreme
6448001 i think it comes back to that moderate maverick image that hes tried to portray
6448002 but when you peel the onion back the record shows that this is a guy whos been very anti choice since he entered the u s house of representatives back in 1983

6448020 in the current climate its not surprising that more people are looking to fix their mortgage rate for longer
6448021 its more important than ever for borrowers to shop around for the best mortgage deal overall and not just settle for the cheapest headline rate
6448022 uninsured drivers dont intentionally try and kill other road users so these laws are unlikely to act as a disincentive to the vast majority of uninsured drivers
6448023 the law needs to hold uninsured drivers responsible for their actions before they cause fatalities on our roads

6448052 i was probably a little too relaxed i didnt have that real race head on me
6448053 i probably shouldnt say this but even though we had all day i ended up having to get out of the boat halfway up the warm up lake and walked over the middle section carrying his kayak just to get to the start line on time maybe that was a little too laidback
6448054 if you have a set goal the goal is an olympic medal

6448063 firstly i believe it is not surprising that after these incidents some people may be concerned that we have taken our eye off the ball
6448064 its safety record is second to none and it is one of the safest airlines and will remain one of the safest airlines in the world
6448065 so just to say our safety standards and the quality of our maintenance have not changed
6448066 yeah there are plenty but i will let others talk about those
6448067 people thought we were a bit ruthless through the ansett period but i think that has been proven to be right
6448068 we now have three quality airlines a high range of fares across the sector so its worked out fairly well
6448069 we will have to take part in it one way or the other and that will require some forward thinking
6448070 people should not be spooked by the idea that we will have to be part of a bigger grouping
6448071 airlines cannot continue the way they are at the moment
6448072 wait around for a while and ill be doing some charity work
6448073 its clear that in the current market environment we have to make some tough decisions about refocusing this business
6448074 clearly a lot has to be done and we have to start from the top
6448075 its clear that in the next few years we are going to be everyones going to be working in a world where capital and debt are constrained
6448076 reflect our desire to move the board more closely into line with asx governance requirements
6448077 given the state that the company is in at the moment someone has to take responsibility for that and i think that shareholders will be laying the blame on mr green
6448078 i understand the risks i have personally had conversations with both jim and phil and i am satisfied they understand the role if that changes then other conversations will happen
6448079 if i am disappointed then the rest of the board will have something to say and do about that
6448080 he mr green will be there for guidance for his knowledge but it is my view that will take this company forward not previous management
6448081 its too easy to simply reference market conditions alone as the cause for the current circumstances facing babcock

6448084 we the undersigned urge you to declare a moratorium on immigration raids in the state of rhode island until our nation can implement a comprehensive and just reform of our immigration laws
6448085 it is our hope that such reform will make immigration raids obsolete until then we believe that raids on the immigrant community are unjust unnecessary and counter productive
6448086 as religious leaders we understand and support the need to apprehend and arrest individuals who are responsible for felonies and other serious crimes the enforcement of just laws is necessary for public safety and the common good but the arrest of serious criminals is not what we have observed in the arrest and detention of immigrants that has taken place recently in our state particularly in newport and in providence
6448087 what we have witnessed is that the police action of ice against immigrants has divided the community instilled fear in our streets disrupted the everyday life of good people and separated family members innocent of any crime from one another
6448088 the confusing and secretive detention of those arrested has further complicated the situation as religious leaders concerned for our people we would be negligent of our pastoral duties if we didnt speak out against these unjust government policies and practices
6448089 we encourage the agents and staff of ice to evaluate the morality of their participation in immigration raids in the context of their faith and sanctity of their conscience
6448090 if their discernment leads them to the conclusion that they cannot participate in such raids in good conscience we urge them not to do so if ice agents refuse to participate in immigration raids in conformity with their faith and conscience we urge the federal government to fully respect the well founded principles of conscientious objection

6448098 whenever a new environment goes around an old one there is always terror
6448099 every age creates as an utopian image a nostalgic rear view mirror image of itself which puts it thoroughly out of touch with the present the present is the enemy the present is the and this will delight you norman the present is only faced in any generation by the artist the artist is prepared to study the present as his material because it is the area of challenge to the whole sensory life and therefore it is anti utopian it is a world of anti values and the artist who comes into contact with the present produces an avant garde image that is terrifying to his contemporaries
6448100 it would be a very dangerous move to have a situation where the government saw its major role as guaranteeing lending
6448101 there is no reason why in the long run you need any guarantee of lending to the mortgages are increasingly hard to secure as lenders themselves are having difficulty sourcing credit
6448102 if the government is going to come up with something then we need to know about it now

6448175 while i say that they are hoping for low single digit growth in terms of sales sales revenue and costs of operations are increasing in double digit so when you balance the two up the bottom line is not going to look very rosy
6448176 when you look at the asian economies they are still very resilient and dynamic the situation we have will pass it is a question of time and how one manages their business

6448204 for us the measure of our success is not how many cds we sell
6448205 when youre signed to a label you dont make much money out of cds sold anyway and as a rock band which is a small niche market in sa it becomes even harder to make money off cd sales by using the internet and the option of free downloads we hope to create a strong fan base and generate interest both here and internationally

6448223 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6448224 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6448225 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6448226 the negotiators have taken this very very far but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6448227 obviously the american forces are here coalition forces are here at the invitation of the iraqi government
6448228 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people respects iraqs sovereignty
6448229 but the goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
6448230 that is the goal and that has been the goal from the beginning
6448231 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6448232 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6448233 really we are very very close to closing this agreement
6448234 and as we said from the beginning there is no hidden agenda here
6448235 but really we are redoubling our efforts to bring this to a successful conclusion
6448236 we as the sadr movement denounce this dubious visit and such timing we reaffirm our stance of rejecting the long term agreement we demand the iraqi government and on the highest levels not to sign this unjust agreement and we demand the withdrawal of the government as soon as possible
6448237 every time we do something you tell me america will do this and will do that i want to tell you something very clear dont worry about american pressure on israel we the jewish people control america and the americans know it

6448271 this is something that couldnt have come at a worse time for spanair
6448272 all airline crashes have a short term impact on revenues before later recovering but in spanairs case it could affect the companys viability

6448286 hes running straight ahead now hes doing that hes starting to do the cutting stuff hes been doing that at practice as well the big thing for him is getting his body back in shape hes been running under the water
6448287 hes been jogging back and forth just the consistency of running every play its a little different when youre running in bursts of four to six seconds as he feels comfortable well start to move him in and get him ready
6448288 he hasnt even practiced yet first and foremost is to get him healthy healthy enough where he can go through a whole practice ill be able to determine that when he makes a full practice
6448289 its all going to be based on how healthy his ankle feels how healthy he feels your body can only take what you put out the only guy that knows that is percy
6448290 when you come out of a junior college his system hell be the first to tell you they were very limited on plays as far as what they do

6448292 for him to come here and get adjusted to everything we teach and want and what we expect that was very tough for him and you saw that this spring hes a completely different young man this fall and as long as he continues to work hes going to be successful this year
6448293 one thing about brandon is hes been a playmaker i alluded to this last week hes still learning the receiver position but thats great hes getting better brandon works

6448296 the crowns theory was that the ar 10 is capable of firing projectiles in rapid succession during one pressure of the trigger the crown attempted to show that by playing a video of an officer removing the safety lever from the gun loading two cartridges into the magazine and then firing a burst of two shots the video went on to show the officer loading three cartridges into the magazine and firing a burst of three shots conclusive proof right
6448297 wrong the firearm was merely malfunctioning removing the safety lever allowed the trigger mechanism parts to move into a wrong position and prevented the sear from holding the hammer back as it is designed to do so fire extract eject feed and as the bolt reaches the forward and locked position the hammer which has been following the bolt instead of staying cocked as it is designed to do gives a slight blow to the firing pin it is a very weak blow not enough to fire most cartridges
6448298 when the ar 10 or any other semi auto rifle is demonstrating hammerfollow it is never cocked proper hammer impact is impossible

6448382 this is certainly not what we would have hoped we would have hoped that the animal would have been ok
6448383 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6448384 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6448385 without craig bellamy for us to play with two front men is a luxury
6448386 a lot of the problems we had were behind parry and eastwood and in front of carl fletcher and carl robinson
6448387 it was nice to be back for wales but obviously the result and the way we performed in the second half was disappointing
6448388 im coming back and have to learn we need to put the loss to the back of our minds and concentrate on the world cup qualifiers starting at home to azerbaijan on 6 september
6448389 the manager had his reasons for dropping players to the u21s
6448390 im sure that theyll be back with us in a couple of weeks and well be stronger for that
6448391 the georgia defeat was very disappointing but it was a very timely reminder that every game is difficult
6448392 the possibility of a block is high and id say it should be due to a content issue
6448393 it is much more traumatic when it happens to a child because it is against nature the sense of impotence is much stronger
6448394 the plane would not fail to the point of causing a tragedy
6448395 from the day schumers letter was made public on june 26 until the closure of the bank a run on the bank took place and the failure became inevitable

6448400 which is not only necessary but essential for his defence
6448401 has held that the uk government is under a duty to disclose evidence which it holds about the treatment of binyam mohamed between his detention by pakistani authorities in april 2002 and his subsequent reappearance in bagram air base in july 2004
6448402 we are considering the implications of this judgment very carefully
6448403 we have never contested that mr mohameds defence lawyers should have access to information which would assist him in his defence in any trial at guantanamo bay
6448404 the court recognised the strenuous efforts that we have made to assist mr mohamed in guantanamo bay including efforts to ensure that the information hmg holds which relates to a small part of mr mohameds account of what happened to him is made available to him for purposes of his defence in any prosecution in the us system
6448405 for strong reasons of national security to which the court accepted we were entitled to give the highest weight we could not agree to disclose this information voluntarily
6448406 these and other issues relating to national security will be considered at a further hearing next week
6448407 todays judgment reflects the abhorrence of decent society at the methods employed by the united states government in the supposed war on terror
6448408 it has taken the courts of this country to intervene and reiterate the importance of upholding the rule of law
6448409 we can only hope that the foreign secretary will now reflect on this judgment and provide direct assistance to binyams defence team
6448410 compelling the british government to release information that can prove mr mohameds innocence is one obvious step towards making up for the years of torture that he has suffered
6448411 the next step is for the british government to demand an end to the charade against him in guantanamo bay and return him home to britain
6448412 we commend the courts recognition that torture is abhorrent and can never be justified
6448413 that evidence plainly discloses a case to answer but bm contends that this evidence is inadmissible because it was obtained as a result of a two year period of incommunicado detention between april 2002 and may 2004 during which he was subjected to torture and cruel inhuman or degrading treatment at the hands of the pakistani and moroccan authorities with the connivance of the united states government and to similar treatment by the united states government itself
6448414 because he contends he is under no duty to do so and because of his concerns of resulting damage to national security
6448415 will make no order for the provision of the information
6448416 and the court has made its decision on those issues at a further hearing and if the court decides that information is to be provided has resolved any dispute as to the manner in which it is to be provided
6448417 was in fact any wrongdoing by or on behalf of the united states government
6448418 it is important to emphasise that we therefore do not do so
6448419 it is clear from the evidence we have seen that every effort has been made by the united kingdom government to try and secure bms return and to provide him with assistance save for disclosing to his lawyers the documents and information the subject of these proceedings
6448420 the refusal to disclose is based on concerns of damage to national security that such disclosure might well entail
6448421 has a very strong record in advocating the case against torture and urging other states not to use torture
6448422 this is a welcome ruling any information that the uk government holds about how binyam mohamed may have been treated must be made available to his legal team
6448423 if torture or ill treatment has taken place it should be exposed investigated and any confessions extracted under torture should be discounted
6448424 binyam has already been held in harsh conditions for over six years according to his lawyer his mental health has suffered considerably
6448425 david miliband should ask the us to move him to a less oppressive part of the guantanamo prison complex at the earliest opportunity
6448426 companies save 30 percent to 50 percent by using contract attorneys and paralegals instead of sending the same work to a law firm
6448427 2 5 of total invoiced initially 8 10 after tuning
6448428 the company saves up to 15 on fixed fee matters
6448429 by training hr staff in how to investigate and respond to employment related complaints
6448430 spending on legal services had fallen by at least 25 percent as a result of using
6448431 a 50 percent reduction in data processing charges and a 70 percent reduction in hosting charges
6448432 cost savings of about 30 to 40 can be achieved through israel offshoring and about 50 to 60 in asia
6448433 hundreds of thousands of dollars a year by hiring experienced paralegals
6448434 reduce d our costs of discovery by approximately 97 percent

6448436 ive seen civilians get killed when a roadside bomb goes off and they get caught in the crossfire
6448437 a guy lost his face and still was alive a bomb went off
6448438 you cant turn this on and off like a light switch thats the problem people think you come back from this conflict like any war and you just go back to normal business as usual its not that way
6448439 the government doesnt see these people as casualties of war and they are

6448441 we just got a great call with a great offer and youve got to consider those
6448442 this summer we see that rising food and energy costs are playing havoc with budgets both for families that were already struggling to make ends meet and for summer programs that are trying to serve hungry children
6448443 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6448444 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6448445 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6448446 the negotiators have taken this very very far but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6448447 obviously the american forces are here coalition forces are here at the invitation of the iraqi government
6448448 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people respects iraqs sovereignty
6448449 but the goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
6448450 that is the goal and that has been the goal from the beginning
6448451 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6448452 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6448453 really we are very very close to closing this agreement
6448454 and as we said from the beginning there is no hidden agenda here
6448455 but really we are redoubling our efforts to bring this to a successful conclusion
6448456 we as the sadr movement denounce this dubious visit and such timing we reaffirm our stance of rejecting the long term agreement we demand the iraqi government and on the highest levels not to sign this unjust agreement and we demand the withdrawal of the government as soon as possible

6448462 iraq is fast becoming one of the united states top customers for military sales since january 2007 iraq has spent 3 1 billion on u s weapons that number looks likely to grow exponentially as iraq uses its vast unspent reserves of petrodollars to develop its army into a force capable of defending its borders against hostile neighbors in the past two months alone the pentagon has alerted congress of a possible 8 7 billion worth of additional military sales to iraq for everything from lightweight attack helicopters to armored ambulances to binoculars

6448467 when you hit about that 20th or 21st practice its always that time of year where youre tired of banging on one another and youre looking forward to turning that corner and trying to get ready for game week
6448468 theres still some things we have to get done and we have to get better we have to practice better than we did today we didnt practice very good
6448469 we were in a punt drill and he gets rolled up we have to stay off the ground i dont think its too bad
6448470 hopefully the next few days well see a much smoother operating team
6448471 this is what we have in this package this is what we have in that package and hopefully we can get all 11 guys on the same page
6448472 each guy has to respond to the challenge any time you have a tremendous athlete that you take out of your scheme its a negative the next guy just has to respond
6448473 theres nothing you can do about them you hate them but its part of football youd rather they never happen but id rather they happen now than happen in the middle of the season the best thing about it that i take away from it is it gives some guys some other opportunities to step up and help us hopefully i can find out who else wants to take charge up front
6448474 the first time when it all happened everybody was kind of looking around for who was going to lead us
6448475 now its kind of good for our team not that theyre hurt but its good to say the ship is going to keep moving thats something they needed to see also peria aint going to be here next year but ill be glad to get him back make that clear
6448476 my thing is i get scott mentally and physically prepared to play this game
6448477 hes chased the ball hes made plays i have a philosophy that if you make plays in practice you make plays in the game if you dont make tackles in practice i dont know how youll make them on the weekend he made tackles and hes playing assignment ball
6448478 going to get better i just need time parnell is making improvement and its day to day hes getting better im patient and hes being patient
6448479 thats all we ever talk about if we had him from day one as a young man skys the limit the uniqueness of it is when we watch film parnell knows all the football greats i turn on an nfl tape he says thats such and such he knows them all football is his favorite sport but he plays basketball
6448480 made his first tackle since hes been in camp tuesday
6448481 i was excited it was his best practice jerrell powe aint but a freshman yesterday was by far his best practice everyone all the coaching staff was like hey what did yall think i saw the same things everyone was proud to see that but now its a new day justin sanders is out and hes getting a lot of reps if he can do it im all for him

6448486 im delighted to have come to a club like middlesbrough theres a great set up here
6448487 hopefully i can impress the manager and play regular football because thats what i need if i am to realise my biggest ambition and play for the england senior team
6448488 i sat in the stands and watched the spurs game and i was really impressed
6448489 i know that david wheater is a centre back in fact he is very good centre back but he has shown that he has the qualities to play right back as well
6448490 i thought he did very well there it means that i can take nothing for granted but then i wouldnt expect it any other way
6448491 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6448492 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6448493 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6448494 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6448495 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6448496 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
6448497 what is scary is to produce a marriage line and then november comes and its recalled then we have thousands of dollars of inventory waiting

6448517 i got maybe 10 feet away and he said no come on i want to talk to you about it i hesitated but thought maybe well resolve this once and for all i went back he said something im not sure what he said and i said something like twelve years later were still trying to clean up the mess you idiots made and that was when he punched me it was over before i even knew what happened i didnt know someone could hit someone so fast

6448536 if you write a letter to the editor attacking bush you could be deemed as purposefully and materially supporting hostilities against the united states if you organize or join a public demonstration against iraq or against the administration the same designation could befall you one dark comedy aspect of the legislation is that senators or house members who publicly disagree with bush criticize him or organize investigations into his dealings could be placed under the same designation in effect congress just gave bush the power to lock them up

6448829 turning the spotlight on its dirty little secret securing the common point of failure in it risk controls
6448830 most enterprises have been so concerned about the threat on the outside that they may have turned a blind eye to this soft underbelly where the poor state of control over the most sensitive and critical functionality is one of its most pernicious dirty little secrets
6448831 this has created an environment where the potential for financially devastating and headline creating events is greatly increased both from the risks posed by an insider gone bad as well as from the inadvertent misuse by a well intentioned administrator causing wide ranging unintended consequences

6448869 we have been waiting for this moment for 15 years
6448870 whats becoming quite apparent is that the way you actually have an impact on health development and poverty alleviation is when people adopt certain behaviours
6448871 its just a matter of getting them to understand that what is a long established habit is in fact harmful and that you can do something about it
6448872 we actually use shame we go into communities and say to people do you realise how faecally contaminated your community is
6448873 we do walks of shame where you take a group of people and you walk around and you say look heres some human faeces here and somebody else has had a shit there and you do this community mapping where everybody comes and says where they defecate
6448874 and you get them to realise how disgusting this is to live in an environment that is totally contaminated

6448899 cabinet ministers plotting is nothing new we have it in afghanistan too
6448900 you know that you are in the frontline in the fight against the taliban you know that by what you are doing here you prevent terrorism coming to the streets of britain
6448901 this week we are celebrating the olympics where we have had great success
6448902 but this week also i believe that our olympic athletes and everybody else in our country will remember that you have showed exactly the same courage professionalism and dedication

6448914 even with the current historically affordable mortgage rates news continues to show signs of weakening in the housing sector
6448915 for example housing starts fell to 0 965 million units annualized in july the slowest pace since march 1991 as a result homebuilder confidence remained at an all time record low in august since the series began in january 1985
6448916 of whether home prices may be slowing their descent as recent monthly indices have shown or whether the observed deceleration was temporary
6448917 it is possible that salesforce coms business is simply becoming more seasonal as it increasingly addresses large enterprise wide deployments and will hinge more upon large sequential increases in fourth quarter billings
6448918 we are concerned that smbs which make up 2 3 of salesforces customer base may suffer more markedly than their larger counterparts amid any ongoing economic weakness and that this may in turn impact salesforces bookings new and renewal and ultimately salesforces top line
6448919 indeed salesforce appears to have had some softness in its deferred revenues and bookings in the quarter perhaps giving fuel to this concern
6448920 the courts have said time and time again that the supply of controlled and particularly class a drugs will be treated very seriously indeed

6448926 queenslands economy is booming its appetite for electricity is growing faster than any other state in australia
6448927 its going to have to make decisions earlier than other states in terms of what the next generation of power plants are going to be
6448928 given 90 per cent of electricity comes from fossil fuel and in the future we cant use fossil fuels at least not to the same extent the creation of this group to stimulate an objective debate about nuclear power makes a lot of sense
6448929 nuclear energy has been going for 50 years but not many people know much about it
6448930 the idea is to be an education forum to help educate people on the pros and cons of nuclear energy
6448931 there is no logic i can see for queensland to not develop uranium reserves
6448932 the notification to other vets about the outbreak should have been more timely and accurate
6448933 i dont think theres anyone in the whole team who would have a bad word to say about him
6448934 he was easygoing obliging would never shirk what he had to do
6448935 since 1994 theres been a bit of an increasing incidence
6448936 every year we seem to be having one two or three outbreaks so the disturbing thing for me is does that mean its increasing in the flying fox population
6448937 as a result of climate change and environmental degradation were seeing wild animals brought into closer contact with domestic animals and humans and that will increase the spread of these diseases
6448938 if you do it again ya little black arsehole youre goin t be in the f n river

6448940 there is no warning there is nothing on this book which says it contains things that may not be appropriate for children

6448951 the qualifying will be extremely important although i think that there are some possibilities on the track to overtake
6448952 like at montreal you also need a bit of luck and i hope that it will not end for me as it did in canada anyway theres no need to worry until we race
6448953 if its hot that will help ferrari we just have to fight until the end and try to win
6448954 we are confident that the failure we suffered in budapest was a one off
6448955 it was a four year old male koala and we took it to the australian wildlife hospital at australia zoo at beerwah for a post mortem
6448956 they reckoned it was the subject of a bashing death
6448957 those responsible say that it will take two days at the most to finish identifying people by their fingerprints dna identification will take a bit more
6448958 i took a child into the truck and he thought he was in a film
6448959 we have to closely monitor the records but we see no reason to take such measures
6448960 its been years since engine failure on take off or a fire has prevented a flight from continuing
6448961 thats why we have education campaigns and materials about responsible pet ownership
6448962 so my position on this is that we will only go and introduce another regulation another sort of requirement another fee on the people of brisbane if there is an absolute clear need
6448963 if other councils want to go ahead and do that thats fine
6448964 we obviously feel there is a real need for compulsory desexing
6448965 mandatory desexing of dogs and cats should be investigated as one of several measures of reducing euthanasia rates
6448966 we are also in favour of offering rebates to cat owners who get their cats desexed
6448967 the lord mayor has his head in the sand if he thinks nothing more should be done to reduce the number of animals that are put down each year
6448968 theyve rung me up and left messages but ive basically said no way i see no financial benefit for 13 million to be leaving the local economy thats the loss which is estimated to be generated from the extra poker machines
6448969 we have a members facility at the lions den near the gabba and that facility works well on match days but slightly under 50 per cent of our members are located in southern suburbs at a very short distance from the springwood cbd
6448970 they are very strange talking points when no one is talking about them
6448971 then spell out what beattie did and tell her the comparison makes her look weak and that now we have a left premier we want to see some benefits to the faction by more left members
6448972 tell her beattie either sweet talked ministers out or was a bastard to them the ones he sacked were always allowed to resign

6448976 it was a four year old male koala and we took it to the australian wildlife hospital at australia zoo at beerwah for a post mortem
6448977 they reckoned it was the subject of a bashing death
6448978 theres a fundamentally strong business model at steve amp barrys that just needs some fine tuning to get it back on the growth track in order to reach its full potential
6448979 really the break needs to be much longer for us to get those broken bones healed
6448980 ive never seen this many guys hurt on a team and then to still be as successful as we are right now
6448981 theyre good at stopping the run and this year theyre not giving up very much in the passing game either
6448982 we have to find a way to manage what he does out there thursday night
6448983 the biggest thing is hit him is to hit ricky ray
6448984 we need to stop ricky ray to stop this team
6448985 i saw watchmen its f ing astounding the non disclosure agreement i signed prevents me from saying much but i can spout the following with complete joygasmic enthusiasm snyder and co have pulled it off remember that feeling of watching sin city on the big screen and being blown away by what a faithful translation of the source material it was in terms of both content and visuals triple that and youll come close to watching watchmen
6448986 we have to be vigilant across all our output to make sure that it continues to remain connected with the audience

6448989 nearly three in 10 voters 29 pointed to mccain as the candidate running a negative campaign compared to just 5 who said obama is running a negative campaign mccains 29 rating is the highest of any one candidate in the previous two presidential elections
6448990 a majority of voters say mccain is spending more time attacking obama than explaining what he would do as president obama by better than two to one is viewed as running a positive campaign
6448991 the obama campaign has begun answering calls to respond to months of mccain attack ads
6448992 without craig bellamy for us to play with two front men is a luxury
6448993 a lot of the problems we had were behind parry and eastwood and in front of carl fletcher and carl robinson
6448994 it was nice to be back for wales but obviously the result and the way we performed in the second half was disappointing
6448995 im coming back and have to learn we need to put the loss to the back of our minds and concentrate on the world cup qualifiers starting at home to azerbaijan on 6 september
6448996 the manager had his reasons for dropping players to the u21s
6448997 im sure that theyll be back with us in a couple of weeks and well be stronger for that
6448998 the georgia defeat was very disappointing but it was a very timely reminder that every game is difficult
6448999 i didnt mean to kill him just wanted to scare him a little but my uber sword of leetness was too much for him lolz
6449000 whatever else history may say about me when im gone i hope it will record that i appealed to your best hopes not your worst fears to your confidence rather than your doubts my dream is that you will travel the road ahead with libertys lamp guiding your steps and opportunitys arm steadying your way
6449001 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal

6449003 oh gott war das schnell aber gut da musst du jetzt durch
6449004 which is not only necessary but essential for his defence
6449005 has held that the uk government is under a duty to disclose evidence which it holds about the treatment of binyam mohamed between his detention by pakistani authorities in april 2002 and his subsequent reappearance in bagram air base in july 2004
6449006 we are considering the implications of this judgment very carefully
6449007 we have never contested that mr mohameds defence lawyers should have access to information which would assist him in his defence in any trial at guantanamo bay
6449008 the court recognised the strenuous efforts that we have made to assist mr mohamed in guantanamo bay including efforts to ensure that the information hmg holds which relates to a small part of mr mohameds account of what happened to him is made available to him for purposes of his defence in any prosecution in the us system
6449009 for strong reasons of national security to which the court accepted we were entitled to give the highest weight we could not agree to disclose this information voluntarily
6449010 these and other issues relating to national security will be considered at a further hearing next week
6449011 todays judgment reflects the abhorrence of decent society at the methods employed by the united states government in the supposed war on terror
6449012 it has taken the courts of this country to intervene and reiterate the importance of upholding the rule of law
6449013 we can only hope that the foreign secretary will now reflect on this judgment and provide direct assistance to binyams defence team
6449014 compelling the british government to release information that can prove mr mohameds innocence is one obvious step towards making up for the years of torture that he has suffered
6449015 the next step is for the british government to demand an end to the charade against him in guantanamo bay and return him home to britain
6449016 we commend the courts recognition that torture is abhorrent and can never be justified
6449017 that evidence plainly discloses a case to answer but bm contends that this evidence is inadmissible because it was obtained as a result of a two year period of incommunicado detention between april 2002 and may 2004 during which he was subjected to torture and cruel inhuman or degrading treatment at the hands of the pakistani and moroccan authorities with the connivance of the united states government and to similar treatment by the united states government itself
6449018 because he contends he is under no duty to do so and because of his concerns of resulting damage to national security

6449021 was in fact any wrongdoing by or on behalf of the united states government
6449022 it is important to emphasise that we therefore do not do so
6449023 it is clear from the evidence we have seen that every effort has been made by the united kingdom government to try and secure bms return and to provide him with assistance save for disclosing to his lawyers the documents and information the subject of these proceedings
6449024 the refusal to disclose is based on concerns of damage to national security that such disclosure might well entail
6449025 has a very strong record in advocating the case against torture and urging other states not to use torture
6449026 this is a welcome ruling any information that the uk government holds about how binyam mohamed may have been treated must be made available to his legal team
6449027 if torture or ill treatment has taken place it should be exposed investigated and any confessions extracted under torture should be discounted
6449028 binyam has already been held in harsh conditions for over six years according to his lawyer his mental health has suffered considerably

6449066 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6449067 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6449068 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend

6449082 did you ever receive the girl you ordered from the sears catalog
6449083 yes maam my daddy told a story about my aunt karen she was a pilot in desert storm and her plane got hit she had to bail out over enemy territory and all she had was a flask of whiskey a pistol and a survival knife she drank the whiskey on the way down so the bottle wouldnt break and then her parachute landed right in the middle of twenty enemy troops she shot fifteen of them with the gun until she ran out of bullets killed four more with the knife till the blade broke and then she killed the last enemy with her bare hands

6449119 people are afraid its like fear creates this veil of impossibility and it is hanging over all of our heads
6449120 and the problem with fear is that it cuts us off fear is the worst enemy it cuts us off from one another and our own families and our communities and it has certainly cut us off from the rest of the world we dont know our neighbors we dont talk we believe that our pain is our own we dont realize that the struggles and challenges of all of us are the same we are too isolated
6449121 when you dont have much when you know how precious life is even in the worst state you are afraid to give up what you have for fear that something different will be worse but the truth of the matter is things have gotten worse
6449122 and folks are struggling like never before working harder than ever believing that their hard work will lead to some reward some payoff but what they find is that they get there and the bar has changed things are different wasnt enough so you have to work even harder
6449123 the true number of people responding to emergencies is less than 70 000
6449124 the fact that this year will be our sixth annual womens fire service conference at the fire academy reflects that increase
6449125 eight years ago when i attended a county convention state convention there werent a lot of women there
6449126 with the numbers going down with the men we have to train the girls to make them stronger
6449127 you have to be able to trust who youre with you have to be able to depend on them with your life
6449128 most men in the fire service at least in schuylkill they treat me like a sister
6449129 thats the way you have to think of it i dont want the division i want it all to be one the girls that are in it they want to get stronger through this organization so they can take that strength back to their individual companies
6449130 so they can provide a better service and the guys can put more on their hands and give them more responsibility
6449131 we hope to have open elections of officers when were chartered and right now were trying to arrange with a local attorney a chartering process
6449132 we have completely enough people for the charter but we dont have any funds or anything
6449133 for the past five years ive been going to the pennsylvania state fire academy in lewistown they have a womens conference weekend and ive gone to it and taken the classes and all and i thought to myself is this all there is three days out of the whole year
6449134 i got out of it and thought to myself i have about 50 friends in the fire service that are in the county and we could train together
6449135 i think were down on recruiting and were down on retaining existing members when i look at it from a statewide perspective and i think naturally the same trend is there for schuylkill county
6449136 it gives us additional people that we need to have and i got to say at least in my experience women are quite capable of taking care of the job performing the job
6449137 if youre just out to prove a point youre not going to be in this long but if you want to develop into a team firefighter then youll be okay
6449138 its just a word to me personally it doesnt matter youre doing a job and youre helping a team youre helping a group if they change it great if they dont you dont quit
6449139 some of the girls get mad when they say firemans convention because women can die too
6449140 i have the ultimate respect for men who have done this into their 70s theyre the ones who can teach this younger generation of boys and girls
6449141 youre playing a boys game its like playing a game you have to deal with it
6449142 the fire service was founded by franklin and im sure in the colonial days they did not expect women to be fighting fires
6449143 theyre available and if theyre willing to do the training i think its good personally
6449144 for 10 years i was a secretary then i was a financial secretary

6449150 i grew up loving linebackers i still feel like im a linebacker at heart so it was pretty shocking and it hurt for a minute but i knew it would help the team coach norm parker really wanted me to switch so i knew it would be the best for me too
6449151 i think mitch was a little hesitant but he agreed to give it a shot and it has really worked out well
6449152 he was recruited as a middle linebacker type player we try to get good football players and he was a good fit for our program the biggest thing we saw when recruiting mitch was a real enthusiasm and passion for the game and a great attitude
6449153 they said if i switched positions i might see playing time my freshman year and having playing time builds your confidence i like the contact every play youre in the mix all the time and youre hitting someone on every play
6449154 my family is number one they have always been there for me my mom has always been there and my brother helped me through the football aspects of everything i also looked up to some great players i never met i studied how they played the game and how they acted you just want to take mental notes of how other people act that have been there and how you want to be like when you get to that stage
6449155 mitch has already established himself as a good player in the big ten
6449156 i dont think he should put a cap on what he can accomplish he has a knack for making big plays hes strong physical and elusive and plays his position well we expect him to play his best football this season
6449157 growing up i never really followed the hawkeyes or wasnt really a college fan
6449158 i was into the nfl and the miami dolphins it wasnt until my sophomore year in high school that i started following iowa and college football
6449159 when i started watching them they were doing really well the 10 win seasons the orange bowl it just felt right the big ten is a physical conference and i take myself as a physical guy i felt comfortable with the coaching staff coach chris doyle and the guys i met on my recruiting trips i just felt comfortable with the guys id be playing with and the conference i would be playing in
6449160 it was a shame that we let that one go it was within our grasp we were on a run there at the end of the year and we just kind of took that for granted that game served as motivation especially for the guys who played in that game and put all they had into it
6449161 if we come to play every game and play as hard as we know we can
6449162 its a matter of how hard we work we need to come ready to play and play hard its a great feeling when you win the games you should win not everyone is destined to be a national champion but you can control winning the games you should win
6449163 they have always been there for me my mom has always been there and my brother helped me through the football aspects of everything i also looked up to some great players i never met i studied how they played the game and how they acted you just want to take mental notes of how other people act that have been there and how you want to be like when you get to that stage
6449164 i was coming around the end and forced the fumble
6449165 it was a good feeling all the big hits you dont really feel its just a fluent moment and it just feels right when you hit them

6449185 in the past if you had linguistic intelligence if you could read and write you were smart if you had mathematical and logical intelligence you still got credit for that but what if you had musical intelligence or what if you had kinetic intelligence you see that with musicians and athletes so howard gardner says there are gifts in all of us and its up to us to teach to those
6449186 i have worked on wonderful projects on artful thinking with the metropolitan museum of art children studied paintings not just about the artist and his style but to look at the relationships between the characters in the painting and the setting its a way of developing thoughtful dispositions
6449187 in a looped classroom that gave me two years to develop my program with the same children starting in the first grade i began mixing great works of art with classical music and over time i introduced rock the blues and jazz
6449188 the children were drawn to the range of feelings in the songs as i gave them the backgrounds of the compositions
6449189 alabama for example was about martin luther king and racial discrimination and while my own true love concerned a man and a woman john coltranes love supreme expressed a love for humanity
6449190 ill never know what the listeners feel from my music and thats too bad
6449191 but the more avant garde recordings such as interstellar space
6449192 i have discovered that young children have open welcoming minds and the more pure and emotional the music the more they connect soon they were hooked on john coltranes music

6449201 the underlying idea is that art can be seen anywhere art doesnt have to simply be shown in a gallery or museum it can be transformed by the viewing circumstances and the environment in which it is shown
6449202 ive been in bloomington four years and thats the longest ive been in any place
6449203 a lot of what i make is collapsible and transportable it has to be able to squish down to fit in the back of a truck or storage space
6449204 moving trucks made me think of people moving from old homes into new homes which brought my thoughts to urban sprawl
6449205 i have created mold like objects made out of phone books and positioned them on a map interpretation
6449206 this exhibition takes on an anthropological role with installations that explore urban sprawl the definition of living space consumer design and the collective unconscious
6449207 my hope for the project is that it doesnt end here
6449208 hub is like a combination of a travel mug and ikea flat pack furniture just set up anywhere theres room the idea isnt for us to always have a place to show work people can contact us and they can use it to create their own exhibition space we want it to go beyond us

6449220 it is also a sweeping statement that the families camping out in the city park are on a hunger strike when they are actually calling for the immediate release of their husbands and fathers thus they suffered hunger because their farms are militarized and forced to evacuate

6449235 this u s amateur win demonstrates that these talented amateur players trust the performance of fujikura shafts in the most demanding and important competitions
6449236 winning a pro tour event is always exciting for a shaft manufacturer but winning a long drive event is extremely rewarding because power accuracy and distance are primary objectives for every shaft design

6449240 im well placed in the rankings at the minute but im more concerned with achieving the goals ive set for myself this season one of them is obviously to win ive come very close twice but if i can get over the line this week it would virtually guarantee me my card for the european tour next season ive made a decent start here and im feeling reasonably good at the moment
6449241 i arrived a little late so didnt even have time to pick up a trolley which meant i had to carry my bag my girlfriend arrives later so hopefully she will carry my bag for me because theres a lot of hills out there but i was pretty pleased with my round and to finish with an albatross was just unbelievable

6449258 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in the status of forces agreement
6449259 we are trying to put together an agreement that protects our people that respects iraqi sovereignty that allows us to lay the kind of foundation that we need for making certain that we complete the work weve all sacrificed so greatly to see accomplished
6449260 really we are very very close to closing this agreement and as we said from the beginning there is no hidden agenda here
6449261 i have not put anything like that on my facebook page
6449262 i thought someone was winding me up when i was first told about it until people started ringing me about it maybe someone has been playing a joke

6449265 id also like to see spiderman putting his mask on pictured every week
6449266 oba on his own is a handful for anybody with his pace
6449267 and his leap for the goal at old trafford was nothing short of outstanding

6449273 this is something that couldnt have come at a worse time for spanair
6449274 all airline crashes have a short term impact on revenues before later recovering but in spanairs case it could affect the companys viability
6449275 if a fall in demand is added to staff conflicts over lay offs the company could be at risk of going bankrupt

6449307 nossa equipe foi superior no segundo tempo mas a dinamarca foi melhor no primeiro poderia at ter sa do na frente
6449308 come amos o jogo mal muito lentos e cautelosos mas na segunda parte melhorarmos e acabamos fazendo um bom jogo contra um advers rio de alto n vel
6449309 este sistema de jogo funcionou muito bem na eurocopa com os jogadores que temos na equipe precisamos da mesma forma e isto j funcionou com a dinamarca em especial no segundo tempo

6449318 we are utterly resolute in our determination to support this new democracy of afghanistan
6449319 we will not relax from our efforts to support reconstruction of afghanistan because we understand that with afghanistan the frontline against the taliban what happens in afghanistan affects the rest of the world
6449320 while it is true that there is a summer offensive by the taliban it is also true that the tactics the taliban had to adopt are more of a guerrilla nature than they are a head on confrontation with our forces and we have been successful in winning back territory
6449321 i accept that pakistan and the problems of terrorism there thats something thats got to be raised with the pakistan government
6449322 you make our country proud every day of the week and every week of the year you are truly heroes of our country
6449323 you know that you are on the frontline of the fight against the taliban and you know that what you are doing here prevents terrorism coming to the streets of britain

6449340 nach der vorbereitung bin ich mit dem gef hl nach wildon gefahren dass wir dort punkten k nnen wir haben aber ver ngstigt und verhalten begonnen gegen hartberg war es ein verdienter sieg
6449341 wir sind auf dem richtigen weg eine system umstellung geht nicht von heute auf morgen sechs wochen in der vorbereitung sind da zu wenig das muss uns klar sein aber es wird immer besser
6449342 vor allem am anfang der saison sind aufsteiger immer gef hrlich bei bruck kommt dazu dass sie nur ein jahr aus der landesliga weg waren und sie spielen unter trainer rene poms das 4 4 2 schon viel l nger als wir
6449343 wir haben schon einige taktische berlegungen angestellt wie wir sie knacken k nnen
6449344 well maybe i mean youd have to audition like everybody else but yeah i definitely think you could do it
6449345 im not exactly a small presence anymore in case you hadnt noticed i dont blend
6449346 that doesnt matter in this show its all about character not appearance you have to play multiple characters and i know you can do that well but youd have to audition because i want to see everyone in the mix together and see what works best
6449347 if you want me to be in it i know i can do a good job thats not a problem you know that but i have reservations about a couple of things first of all as i mentioned my fat butt but also im wondering about these guys that are running the show i dont think the timing is right they dont have their act together and honestly in your heart i dont think you think its a good idea either you are letting yourself get boxed into a corner on this you say youre being non committal but i think youre just making excuses to do the show so joe thinks youre a nice guy you wont have the guts to tell him no when the time comes
6449348 if this doesnt work out i have no problem calling the whole thing off i learned from the last time meaning our show company
6449349 no you havent you havent learned a thing a year ago you thought joe was a psycho over actor now all of a sudden hes calling you and buttering you up to do this and youre eating it right up now all of a sudden hes your best buddy and youre letting him lead you straight into a potential disaster come on
6449350 we continue on a weekly basis to be confronted with allegations of extensive corruption most recently by the revelation that president mbeki received r30m on behalf of the anc from a german arms company
6449351 this allegation was predictably and unconvincingly denied tellingly no defamation action has yet been launched by the president this only serves to reinforce the perception that the president and the government are worried that any independent scrutiny of this rotten deal will reveal extensive wrongdoing
6449352 stop stonewalling my efforts to gain access to a number of department of defence documents currently being kept by the sergeant at arms
6449353 i have every reason to believe that these documents may point to large scale irregularities and corruption associated with the deal
6449354 the question of so called corruption in the arms deal
6449355 now that report found that government as government in the primary contracts had not committed anything that was outside of the law
6449356 there was an indication that there were areas in the secondary contracts that needed further investigation
6449357 but this government this parliament is not presented with evidence other than whats available to this government upon which the house can decide that the findings were wrong
6449358 where is the evidence that can actually be tested in our courts
6449359 i think that to continue to make allegations against the president of our country when we cannot take him to court and place evidence there undermines the standing of this country internationally and actually makes a clown of this whole sitting here that we can actually bring those stories here when theres no evidence of any kind
6449360 we made those documents public we opened defence the investigators could come in and look at the documents save that they couldnt take them away but they could examine any document
6449361 contribute to negative coverage of the country in the international media in the run up to both events
6449362 if you add up the location fees film crew are expected to pay up to r25 000 per day
6449363 in many instances the film crew are in johannesburg to film promotional films of the citys key attractions in the run up to the confederations cup and the 2010 fifa world cup
6449364 over and above the location fees crew also need to pay r450 an hour for filming on public roads to these crews it understandably feels as if the city is doing them a favour and not the other way around
6449365 the result is that even london and new york seem to offer more value a scenario that will have a negative impact on the country
6449366 the interest is particularly around 2010 stadiums transport infrastructure host cities hospitality and accommodation services leisure amenities and visitor attractions
6449367 as many of these film shoots are for travel magazines and shows from some of the provinces key international tourism markets this provides a valuable opportunity for the city and the tourism industry to market both its public and privately owned tourism attractions to the world in the run up to 2010
6449368 we have raised these concerns with the city and the tourism industry and have stressed the importance of ensuring uninhibited access by film and television crew to our visitor attractions
6449369 lo que estamos viendo es un verdadero gacetazo producido por el ejecutivo nacional que ha hecho un uso abusivo de la habilitaci n que le ha concedido el parlamento
6449370 los poderes legislativo y judicial est n refrendando este fraude
6449371 lo que estamos observando es la puesta en marcha de una constituci n paralela en la que la mayor falacia apunta hacia los consejos comunales como detentadores del poder cuando en verdad quedan eliminadas las competencias de las alcald as y las gobernaciones para d rselas a unos funcionarios designados por el presidente
6449372 s lo por causa de utilidad p blica o inter s social mediante sentencia firme y pago oportuno de justa indemnizaci n podr ser declarada la expropiaci n de cualquier clase de bienes
6449373 hay ahora una tremenda inseguridad en cuanto al sistema de propiedad todos somos precariamente propietarios y podemos ser despojados de nuestros bienes por el estado esto obliga a cambiar las instituciones del derecho civil

6449405 our goal with the design of the cruze was to be bold not evolutionary
6449406 we wanted to take a big step forward making a strong design statement for chevrolet products around the world
6449407 we are very proud that europe is leading the introduction for this global product
6449408 chevrolet has always stood for expressive value and cruze delivers on that promise like never before it redefines value with its quality design materials and great style both inside and out

6449413 were using our strength in tv and broadband services to integrate both the product and care needs of todays digital consumer
6449414 thats when we began to examine how we do things
6449415 what we were trying to do is create consistency on this practice throughout the city we wanted everyone to have the same procedure
6449416 this certainly sends the message to me that they are not complying with the public records law
6449417 these prices seem to go beyond imposing a reasonable fee
6449418 i think we can make changes if we need to make them
6449419 i dont see under any circumstances how it would cost 20 or 35 for some of these things
6449420 to me it seems like all of it is just making copies
6449421 what i can say is that it costs us too to to get these documents
6449422 its our time were stopping and we get busy working on these requests especially during the political season

6449429 in this league theres not a big gap from top to bottom if a team can get a couple of wins under their belt get a couple of consecutive wins it becomes a team with momentum and things change
6449430 you see it throughout the season in the league what we need to do is get ourselves on a bit of a run where we start collecting some points and position ourselves to be in the playoffs
6449431 when you have landon donovan and david beckham youre not that bad off we have some good players to build this team around we can get better and were capable of getting enough points and qualifying for the playoffs
6449432 we have always felt that the galaxy should aspire to be the club that sets the pace and tone in major league soccer
6449433 i believe bruce sees it the same way and will put us back in that position
6449434 i believe that timeline is important but whats more important is the content and the nature of the understanding that we can reach with the palestinians
6449435 i think any attempt to bridge gaps which might be premature to bridge or any attempt to reach something which is not the comprehensive agreement we want to reach can lead to clashes this can lead to misunderstandings this can lead to violence
6449436 when we are talking two states for two people the idea is israel is the homeland for the jewish people and the palestinian state is the homeland for the palestinians
6449437 i believe that what we called in the past left and right is something that belongs to the past
6449438 now most israelis understand that having two states in the lands comprising historic palestine is an israeli interest

6449441 we are witnessing a shift back toward balance versus the heat everyone had felt a year ago around the facebook ecosystem that felt like it could be the next new thing with unbounded upside

6449724 there is still a lot of oil to develop out there which is why we dont call this geological peak oil especially in places like venezuela russia iran and iraq
6449725 the problem with the supply side of the equation is a problem of accessing the resources in the ground so they can be explored and developed
6449726 its amazing the difference from the 1970s where a lot of money went into exploration development and production of new resources
6449727 it is happening a little bit now but it is not going to be enough

6449734 the american people have a right to know more about barack obamas relationship with unrepentant terrorist william ayers
6449735 will barack obama step forward and call on the university to immediately release all the records
6449736 it leads me to have tremendous fear for the documents
6449737 what if they are going through them right now and deciding which names to take out im completely alarmed i think public scrutiny is the only way to save the documents
6449738 theyll manage to take this all the way past the election
6449739 i coached high school sports and when you have in place talent and teamwork it normally leads to success that defines what is unfolding in life with the help of my long time partner jerret goodale
6449740 both ryan and myself truly would be considered self made success stories
6449741 as i was raised by a single mother who inspired me early in life and made me understand that hard work and honesty are the keystones to creating a successful life path i had full time jobs starting at age 15 and thru the guidance of my grandfather i learned early to handle my money with care thru investments my life changed when i began attending life empowerment training and truly embraced the entrepreneur spirit thru an associate i was introduced to her husband ryan tolley there was an instant bonding experience that led to working as a team after refining our leadership techniques through the teachings of a great mentor who had owned companies in china mexico and africa we decided it was time to take our skills and leadership capabilities and form a business model where we could create success for everyone we touched from the feedback of our recent rollout i am proud to say that that goal has been achieved with flying colors
6449742 as estimates have 64 of the united states adult population are overweight we have a business model www skinnybodyfatwallet com in place that offers the answer to this challenging problem the core product is a gastric bulking agent designed to work with water which expands in the stomach naturally signaling the brain that the stomach is full not only does one control eating habits but it will also reduce the hunger associated with weight loss regimens which target meal portion size by partially filling the stomach before meals it will help reduce overeating thus creating portion control the benefits are incredible it is the first product of its nature to hit the marketplace it contains no drugs or stimulants it works 100 of the time and it will effect the lives of millions in a very positive manner losing weight is a challenge for many and that challenge is a thing of the past for our clients with a product and company destined to become the microsoft of the weight loss industry
6449743 ryan and jerret are a true inspiration to work with as their success has carried over to inspiring myself and many others on a daily basis
6449744 and the great part is having the resource of such an experienced support team to just a call away
6449745 we build our business models around the same concept used to create championship sports teams talent coaching and top line management that work together for a common goal
6449746 ryan and myself are looking for entrepreneurs that want an opportunity to partner with a proven support team and a revolutionary company in order to create a long term business relationship based on a common vision our management team is top notch and our funding is what other startup business ventures dream about
6449747 opportunities are not lost they are taken by someone else

6449751 michigan is for the most part a red state and its up to detroit and the
6449752 and unless we have someone out front whos able to speak and carry obamas message well its critical
6449753 we have a number of people who can stand with sen obama as a surrogate
6449754 shortly after the convention were going to have a come to jesus meeting to decide who are going to be the individuals to carry that message and carry obama around the state and around detroit
6449755 right now i think thats going to be a big challenge to make sure detroiters turn out
6449756 its going to be hard for him to fight against the general tide thats an uphill battle for all republicans nationwide and i think thats whats really bringing him down
6449757 i dont think theres any firing offense for sununu but its a tough year for republicans
6449758 he is a very accomplished ambitious young legislator so its not that hes done a bad job
6449759 its just that his party is having a very tough time and he has a very strong opponent
6449760 in some ways mr sununu has got many things going for him except that he is a republican at a time when theres this shift and no one knows ultimately how strong this shift will be
6449761 but if were playing the guessing game than yeah this race leans democrat
6449762 if mr sununu is the beneficiary of what were seeing in the presidential race a trend for this race to be close and for states to vote along traditional lines he probably has a chance to take himself out of the most endangered category
6449763 theres no question jean shaheen will have the money she needs to be competitive in this race the democrats are going to make sure of that

6449770 its difficult to see how we can service the vast areas of australia with what is left
6449771 there used to be 10 technical staff in our office now we are four and well have to cover the regions where offices have been closed
6449772 acma is contracted to do digital television field strength measurements all over australia using those same technical staff to establish where problem areas exist prior to the analogue switch off in 2013 and believe me there are some real problems
6449773 we have only just scratched the surface with those measurements and havent touched the remote country areas yet

6449776 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6449777 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6449778 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6449779 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6449780 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6449781 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6449782 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6449783 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6449784 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6449785 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6449786 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6449787 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6449788 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6449789 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6449790 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6449791 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6449792 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6449793 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6449794 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

6449800 we suffer from a fiscal cancer it is growing inside us
6449801 our country would need 53 trillion invested today which is about 175 000 per person to deliver on the governments obligations and promises how much of this 53 trillion do we have zip
6449802 four key deficits budget savings balance of payments and leadership
6449803 cancer that threatens the future economic well being of our country children and grandchildren
6449804 we need a grass roots effort to changed the thinking in congress
6449805 i dont see many young people in the audience so thats a disconcerting thing we need to have a lot of youth that are active in terms of shutting down this government this governments out of control its spending too much money we had representative ron paul who was running he was actually speaking wisdom and what did the republican party do they laughed at him
6449806 its exciting to see this but depressing because we have no one to solve these problems
6449807 the federal government is working with corporations to send out jobs to china and mexico
6449808 i see no local politicians involved in this where are they
6449809 we need to save money and our children today are not being trained to save in high school there isnt even training to balance a checkbook
6449810 we want instant gratification when i grew up you didnt buy something unless you needed it we need to look at ourselves in this
6449811 this problem is endemic to us all were buying things we dont want its up to us to say to congress cease and desist spending what we dont have
6449812 every local and county budget has to be balanced we need to move this to state and federal government
6449813 we need to get rid of the two party system and the stranglehold that the media has on that or we will always have what weve always had period
6449814 i think we really need to connect the dots between individuals and the government because the problems are very similar a lot of people have too much mortgage debt too much credit debt the more we create that financial discipline at the individual level i think it will cause a political groundswell that will shine the spotlight on the federal government as well
6449815 were in trouble unless we vote for someone who will raise taxes and no one will vote for them
6449816 i hope we can get a series of articles on what needs to be done we need to look at ourselves to stop spending what we dont have we are a spoiled country
6449817 our attitude should be not spending more than we have
6449818 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6449819 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6449820 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6449821 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6449822 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6449823 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6449824 the first and largest multi specialty emergency critical care hospital
6449825 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6449826 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados

6449835 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

6449837 saddam hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors or the world with nuclear arms poison gas or biological weapons other countries possess weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles with saddam there is one big difference he has used them not once but repeatedly i have no doubt today that left unchecked saddam hussein will use these terrible weapons again
6449838 you allow someone like saddam hussein to get nuclear weapons ballistic missiles chemical weapons biological weapons how many people is he going to kill with such weapons we are not going to allow him to succeed

6449841 iraq continues to be a safe haven transit point or operational node for groups and individuals who direct violence against the united states saddams intelligence service supported financially ansar al islam whose members were being trained in al qaeda camps in afghanistan
6449842 husseins vigorous pursuit of biological chemical and nuclear weapons and his present and potential future support for terrorist acts and organizations make him a terrible danger to the people of the united states
6449843 my position is very clear the time has come for decisive action to eliminate the threat posed by saddam husseins wmds
6449844 every day saddam gets closer to his long term goal of nuclear capability
6449845 theres no question that saddam hussein is a threat to the u s and our allies
6449846 to defend the national security of the united states against the continuing threat posed by iraq
6449847 saddam is in material breach the legitimacy of the security council is at stake and if the security council does not call for the use of force i think we have little option but to act with a larger group of willing nations if possible and alone if we must
6449848 yes saddam has chemical weapons he has biological weapons he is trying to get nuclear weapons
6449849 the world is far safer with the removal of saddam
6449850 were doing great things in west virginia and we have a lot of work ahead of us
6449851 once a staunchly democratic state west virginia has voted republican during the past two presidential elections and gave obama such a primary drubbing that out there can no longer justify calling it purple
6449852 they just dont know you barack you need to come back and spend a little time here
6449853 i believe what we see now is the coalition that has formed over the last eight years is still in place
6449854 the message that is important to that part of ohio to that part of western pennsylvania is a message that resonates with west virginia too
6449855 we still intend to work hard and full throttle because you cant take anything for granted in west virginia
6449856 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
6449857 when suddenly not only are you feeling more insecure with your job you cant get rising wages or rising incomes and the cost of everything from gas to food to healthcare to trying to send your children to college keeps on skyrocketing
6449858 when you find out that you lost your healthcare your pension or you never had it it turns out youre not the only one
6449859 millions of americans have been going through that same loss of security
6449860 these tend to be folks that relocate here they tend to be younger voters also folks who obviously based on their lifestyle would be open to the prescription for change sen obama is offering
6449861 barack obama can spend all the money in the world in some of these republican leaning states but he will still be the most inexperienced presidential candidate in the modern era and he will still have the most liberal record in the united states senate
6449862 he is more liberal than a lot of the state
6449863 its going to be a very difficult race for him in north carolina
6449864 he cant make any promises that are going to help us tomorrow
6449865 its going to be a long time coming out of this

6449872 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
6449873 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6449874 eight hundred fifty jobs of any kind is great news when those jobs are in a technology of tomorrow like electric cars it offers the prospect of even bigger news to follow indiana has what it takes to lead this automotive revolution and today is step one
6449875 indiana is the heart of americas manufacturing might and a linchpin in the automotive industry there is no better place to invest in the clean green energy efficient technology we need to power todays global economy
6449876 indianas educated experienced workforce is second to none and the enthusiastic commitment we have received from governor daniels and other leaders is absolutely unparalleled we couldnt be happier to call this our home
6449877 there is no doubt that enerdel is a leader in advanced manufacturing and we are fortunate that their new global manufacturing and development operations will be located here in marion county
6449878 they are not only bringing great jobs and investment to our county but they are serving as a sign that marion county is a great home for the future of manufacturing
6449879 we are honored and excited that a growing and innovative company like enerdel has chosen to expand its operations to the city of noblesville
6449880 what a fine testament to the talented hard working people of this city and the business friendly environment our economic development team has worked so hard to create we look forward to working with enerdel and to potential future development with them
6449881 the lithium ion battery will revolutionize the hybrid and electric car industry and will make it a reality for the mass market in the very near term
6449882 enerdel has a unique lithium ion chemistry and advanced battery system that provides the safest and most economical energy solution for automotive applications
6449883 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6449884 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6449885 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6449886 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6449887 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america

6449889 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6449890 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6449891 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6449892 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6449893 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6449894 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6449895 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6449896 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6449897 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6449898 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6449899 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6449900 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6449901 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6449902 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
6449903 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
6449904 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6449905 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6449906 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6449907 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6449908 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6449909 we think that this is the biggest most fundamental change we have made
6449910 from 2000 to the end of 2007 ebay kind of fought the trends they tried to keep auctions the focus of the company
6449911 at the visitation friday for billie jefferson it felt just like home
6449912 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6449913 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6449914 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6449915 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6449916 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6449917 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6449918 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6449919 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6449920 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6449921 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6449922 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6449923 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6449924 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6449925 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6449926 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6449927 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6449928 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6449929 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6449930 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6449931 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6449932 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6449933 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6449934 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6449935 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6449936 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care
6449937 im going to let the campaign speak for the campaign
6449938 he visited with my staff just to basically say hi to them and thank them for all their hard work
6449939 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6449940 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6449941 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6449942 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6449943 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6449944 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
6449945 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6449946 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
6449947 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
6449948 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
6449949 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
6449950 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
6449951 what obama is creating is this army of individuals these grass roots activists who are out there trying to change the world in 160 characters or less
6449952 a fundamental change in the way the sec manages collects and distributes information
6449953 moses my servant is dead now then you and all these people get ready to cross the jordan river into the land i am about to give to them to the israelites
6449954 be strong and courageous because you will lead these people to inherit the land i swore to their forefathers to give them 7 be strong and very courageous be careful to obey all the law my servant moses gave you do not turn from it to the right or to the left that you may be successful wherever you go 8 do not let this book of the law depart from your mouth meditate on it day and night so that you may be careful to do everything written in it then you will be prosperous and successful 9 have i not commanded you be strong and courageous do not be terrified do not be discouraged for the lord your god will be with you wherever you go
6449955 go through the camp and tell the people get your supplies ready
6449956 remember the command that moses the servant of the lord gave you the lord your god is giving you rest and has granted you this land 14 your wives your children and your livestock may stay in the land that moses gave you east of the jordan but all your fighting men fully armed must cross over ahead of your brothers you are to help your brothers 15 until the lord gives them rest as he has done for you and until they too have taken possession of the land that the lord your god is giving them after that you may go back and occupy your own land which moses the servant of the lord gave you east of the jordan toward the sunrise
6449957 whatever you have commanded us we will do and wherever you send us we will go
6449958 there is a risk that an entire generations cultural history could be lost if people arent able to retrieve that data
6449959 everyone is switching to digital cameras but weve never demonstrated that digital data can be reliably preserved for a long time
6449960 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6449961 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6449962 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6449963 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6449964 can lose so much money when their servers go down
6449965 people dont realize they need it until they need it
6449966 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6449967 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6449968 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6449969 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6449970 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6449971 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6449972 the guolizhuang menu is a broad introduction to the medicinal benefits of eating animal penises and testicles
6449973 my ultimate idea of success that i havent achieved yet would be for the artistic projects to sustain me financially
6449974 but if i can spend my creative energies on projects that make me happy being part of the mechanism that moves culture forward thats success
6449975 well he would have landed in bounds so therefore it counts
6449976 the guolizhuang menu is a broad introduction to the medicinal benefits of eating animal penises and testicles
6449977 my ultimate idea of success that i havent achieved yet would be for the artistic projects to sustain me financially
6449978 but if i can spend my creative energies on projects that make me happy being part of the mechanism that moves culture forward thats success
6449979 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home
6449980 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6449981 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6449982 why do you need us to join the climate debate are you saying because i am black i am not involved already or that you need more useful victims for your cause agenda
6449983 it becomes evident that while discussing climate we are not witnessing a clash of views about the environment but a clash of views about human freedom
6449984 as someone who lived under communism for most of my life i feel obliged to say that the biggest threat to freedom democracy the market economy and prosperity at the beginning of the 21st century is not communism or its various softer variants
6449985 why do so many people who subscribe to the belief in global warming also subscribe to the leftist liberal viewpoint on so many matters why does this belief appeal to those that have a certain political view
6449986 what does a cane toad and salt water intrusion have to do with global warming see you liberals just flip and spin flip and spin obama is an expert at it
6449987 it was a huge honour for gra shinn f in to proudly lead thousands of republicans through the streets of derry in honour of the enormous courage and sacrifice of the hungerstrikers
6449988 the huge turnout at the march has inspired everyone present it will no doubt bring many new members and also encourage activists to go out and increase their activism ensuring the successful conclusion of our struggle
6449989 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6449990 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6449991 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6449992 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6449993 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6449994 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6449995 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6449996 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6449997 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6449998 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6449999 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
